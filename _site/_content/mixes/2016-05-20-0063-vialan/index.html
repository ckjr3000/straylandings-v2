        <p>You'd be hard pushed to find a more fitting addition to the SM-LL imprint than their latest signee, Vialan. Based in Aaarhus Denmark, Vialan's contribution to the label comes in the form of 'Default 0007' and is very much attuned to the ultra-minimal hardware musings of the imprint's founder, Pokk! Covering seven tracks of crackling, thinned-out dub and technoid beat experiments, 'Default 0007' delves deep into the world of drum machine experimentation.</p>
<p>Speaking to Vialan earlier this month, although always important, it  appears minimalist electronics haven't been the only focus for Vialan over the years. &quot;I got into electronic music sometime in the early '80s when I heard Kraftwerk’s 'Spacelab' played on national radio&quot; he begins when quizzed on his early musical interests. &quot;I was totally amazed - those futuristic sounds were far away from anything I’d ever heard! Fortunately, I recorded it to cassette. I remember making a small exhibition in my room of LEGO spaceships - the space theme seemed to go perfectly with the sound of 'Spacelab'.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Later I discovered Depeche Mode and then I got into Italo-disco. I remember listening to “Discoboksen”, a show on local radio playing all these fresh Italo-disco tracks and mixes. I was into the early electro/hip-hop scene as well and still love a lot of it, especially the Street Sounds 'New York vs L.A. Beats' mix. Later, at high school, I would often go to the local library looking for interesting records and books about the Dadaists. I would hang out in the local record store, buying Cabaret Voltaire, Throbbing Gristle, Einstürzende Neubauten, Skinny Puppy, Front 242 etc. I also listened to punk and more experimental electronic music like Stockhausen and Xenakis.&quot;</p>
<p>Following his school years, Vialan began studying Electronic Engineering before moving to Ireland, departing music for a time due to tinnitus amongst other things. Luckily the hiatus didn't last. &quot;At the end of the '00s I started getting into making music again. I still had some of my old equipment, and slowly started learning Ableton. It took quite some time and when I finally felt I had grasped it, something felt wrong. I discovered I enjoyed making music using hardware a lot more than making music in the box, so I created a setup where I could work without a computer. Most of the tracks on the SM-LL release are excerpts from longish hardware jams, recorded from the main outs of my mixer into a digital recorder. The sound on some of them was quite bad, but Martin [Thompson from SM-LL] did an excellent job mastering them into something a lot better for the Default 0007 release.&quot;</p>

<p>Vialan initially began communicating with SM-LL through Soundcloud around a year ago. From there it appears the progression towards arranging a release was a very natural one. &quot;I messaged him, mentioning I was a big fan of Pokk! and SM-LL&quot; he responds when asked about how the release was formed. &quot;Somehow we got into discussing Roland classics, specifically the CR-78 and the RE-201. Inspired by our conversation I quickly did a track based around the CR-78 kick through the RE-201. Martin liked it and the rest is history (laughs). I already had his releases from Sonuos and An Epic and at about the same time started buying the releases on SM-LL. I’ve bought lots of releases through Bandcamp, but Martin was the first one ever to reply with a nice personal mail saying thanks for the support. That made a major impression on me - discovering that the person releasing some of the cleanest, coolest, most interesting and disciplined music I had heard was also a very polite and nice person.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We send back and forth a lot of ideas, thoughts, tracks and sketches. Honestly I was a bit unsure if I was spamming him or not, so I was a bit nervous when I met up with Lucia and him at Intonal Festival in Sweden, at Malmø’s St. Johannes Church. We met right after Rroses brilliant live performance of 'Having Never Written a Piece for Percussion'. Fortunately, Martin and Lucia both turned out to be even nicer persons in real life than I’d hoped. Lucia and Martin also introduced me to a lot of other nice people, like Finn Albertsson (DJ Finn Of Tomland). Funny thing, because it was Finn’s recommendation on Bandcamp that originally introduced me to SM-LL.&quot;</p>
<p>'Default 0007' is the product of a series of jams conducted by Vialan - his preferred method of working. Martin and Lucia of SM-LL then set about curating these live sessions into a coherent release, with Vialan left intrigued by their final cuts. &quot;At first I was quite surprised by their selection&quot; he states. &quot;It’s quite varied in style - I guess. But after a few listens I found that the tracks kind of supported each other in a good way. And started really liking how the tracks supplemented each other. I’m quite glad they did the selection as I really dislike listening to my own tracks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The tracks were produced over a long period of time and putting them next to each other seemed weird at first. Funny thing is, the tracks were produced very differently. The first track “Juno Dyb” was a snippet of a very simple dub recorded through the microphone of my old iPhone. Martin had asked me about how my Juno was doing. My reply was that it was well - and still had the dub. I included the recording to prove my point. Imagine I was quite surprised when they suggested that as the opening track.&quot;</p>
<p>Vialan's mix for us features a number of the cuts which didn't make it into the final release alongside some more uptempo offerings. In his own words the podcast was his &quot;first mix since making mixtapes in the early '90s, and plenty of tracks were harmed during the making...&quot;</p>
