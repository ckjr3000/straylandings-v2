        <p>About Quanta Records At the beginning of Quanta Records is a group of six friends. We created the label in 2015 because we wanted to release Infinite Fields' music. Aloïs and Michaël (Infinite Fields) had been making music together for a while and the rest of us thought it would be worth taking it to the next level as the sound was becoming more mature. So we released their first EP, Fraction Of Time, and their second, Volna, the year after. After that, we tried to push the label forward step by step, make it more interesting and develop our vision one release after the other. We launched the Particules series last year with Alma Alta’s first EP and since our third release, αίών’s Correspondances, our designer friends, Atrois Studio, are in charge of all the visual aspects of the main series. This year forthcoming releases are definitely important for us. The Particules series will welcome ＧＡＭＥＳＨＡＲＫ™ new album, SHARK 4 お歯黒, at the end of March. It’s difficult to define as it takes from a large panel of influences to form it’s very own sound but I’d say you can expect a mix of computer music, noise and breakcore, if that’s useful. Later this year come two pieces of an experimental electronic music artist who's worked in the contemporary dance scene for years. His music has been played in a lot of theaters around the world but never been released so far. We are really proud he agreed to work with us as he’s a really unique composer.
My ethos towards music I don’t have a musical background. I started listening to a lot of music very young but never properly studied it technically speaking. I remember going to the library, borrowing some CDs in order to rip them at home, returning them and doing it again. It was almost faster than downloading at that time! I think listening to a lot of music without knowing its theory helped me develop an approach based on perceptions. I rely on what it makes me feel, what it conveys in terms of sensation. It applies to my way of approaching art in general. My second approach is a more cultural one: I like to document my listening, learn about the context of a record, the history of a movement, even the micro ones, and the ideas its protagonists were carrying. I’d say it’s complementary: I won’t like a record that doesn’t say anything but won’t spend too much time either on a piece with a strong conceptual consideration that doesn’t appear through its listening.
Where you would like to take it I don’t have personal plans. I recently got interested in linking music and philosophy but I’m just at the beginning of that process and I’m the same with books and records: reading/listening to one gives me three more ideas for the next ones. We started a project with αίών, mixing music with recorded readings or lectures. We’re going to play it for the first time at Les Sonifères #2 this Saturday in Paris and see where it goes after that.
about the mix itself It kind of reflects my ethos towards music. I picked up tracks that I thought mixed together would let me develop a balanced atmosphere which is able to make you feel uncomfortable and light at the same time. My main focus is on selection, after that I let the tracks kind of speak for themselves, even if for this mix I played some at 33rpm instead of 45rpm to sometimes smooth the intensity.</p>
