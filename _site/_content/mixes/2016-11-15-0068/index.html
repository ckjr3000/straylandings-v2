<p>Italian artist Alberto Rosso, aka Morkebla has both an eye and an ear for the futuristic. His <em>Ono-Sendai Cyberspace</em> LP, was littered with references to William Gibson's <em>Sprawl</em> series, setting the context for Rosso's data-moshed beat experiments. Even from the title of his most recent offering, it's clear he hasn't changed interests. <em>A Field of Secondary Craters</em> sees it's release on Edinburgh based Czaszka Records, following several months of encouraging discussions. &quot;I was contacted by the label in Spring 2016,&quot; he begins when asked about his contact with the label. &quot;I was already working on some material and finally ended up sending them some tracks. They showed huge interest and support, which is something precious. I love to work with labels who are truly passionate in their work and follow every release very carefully - Czaszka is surely one of them.&quot;</p>
<p>Rosso says the album is an assortment of tracks constructed across his life, rather than a snapshot of a particular moment in time. The release's name is an attempt to reflect this. &quot;I imagined how the music could be transposed into a visual metaphor&quot; he states. &quot;It could be like a small planet with different craters over its surface. A few days later, I was looking at some pictures taken by NASA satellites, and found one picture that had exactly the same name, <em>A Field of Secondary Craters</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>His interest in space and sci-fi extends back to childhood, adopting music production as a pastime around eight years ago. &quot;I was mainly into experimental sounds and field recordings&quot; he reflects on his early days of production. &quot;Then I focused on more rhythmical, non-dance ambient music. I think my tastes haven't changed that much over years, because I have always enjoyed a wide-range of genres. I have become quite picky with what I buy and listen to, especially because it’s getting more and more difficult to find sounds that you don't forget easily.&quot;</p>
<p>The mix he has provided for us covers three quarters of an hour of amp-textured synthetics and leftfield beat experiments, providing a cross-section of Rosso's recent listening habits. &quot;I wanted to focus on a short time retrospective with some of the music that strongly shaped my last few months&quot; he starts when asked about the mix's construction. &quot;But whenever I began to focus on it, I kept on losing track of what I intended to do. Then I started to imagine this mix as a painting; it’s full of chiaroscuros from each track. Whether you’ll like it or not, I think it represents 100% what Morkebla is now.&quot;</p>
