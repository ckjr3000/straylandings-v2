        <p>DJ and producer Paul Cottam is something of an unlikely hero in the House scene, first gathering a rather impressive level of recognition back in 2009 with a run of three 12”s, melding a plethora of Deep House, Hip Hop, Afrobeat and Disco influences. That each record was released devoid of press campaigns, information about the artist, or artwork, seemed not to hinder their success: all three ended up in Phonica’s ‘Top 50 Singles of 2009’.</p>
<p>Whilst at first Cottam’s press-shy tendencies may have been interpreted as a calculated effort to present himself as a mysterious entity, a 2010 interview with RA revealed Cottam as a surprisingly open, humble, Preston-based individual who had in fact kept his identity hidden due to concerns over sample clearance.</p>
<p>A few years on and Cottam has continued to steadily deliver the goods with his unique, soulful style of downtempo House music, gaining support both for this and his expertly blended DJ sets; a skill which Cottam began at the age of fourteen, playing at parties and clubs in and around Preston.</p>
<p>With a performance at London’s legendary Fabric nightclub alongside Craig Richards, Sigha &amp; Peter Van Hoesen scheduled for Saturday <a href="http://www.fabriclondon.com/club/listing/859">11th January</a>, we were graced with an exclusive ‘Winter Haze’ mix from Cottam to break in the New Year.</p>
