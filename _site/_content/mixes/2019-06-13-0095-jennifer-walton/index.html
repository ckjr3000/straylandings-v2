        <p>Our latest mix comes composer and sound-designer, Jennifer Walton. Following on from our latest Resonance FM show on <a href="http://straylandings.co.uk/radio/video-game-music-etch-lucia-chung">Video Game Music</a>, Walton has made a mix of tracks from Dance Dance Revolution (DDR). To be perfectly honest, this is not a genre I'm particularly familiar with. But thankfully, Walton has provided the following text, to give some context:</p>
<p><em>I've been pretty obsessed with rhythm game music since i got heavily into DDR around 2 years ago. The crossover of heavy dance genres, gets pushed to a stupid extreme with the removal of a boundary for what is dance-able. The focus becomes how fast someone can physically move their feet or tap buttons rather than any cohesive dancing style. This creates bizarre musical moments, with 32nd or 64th notes becoming the regular division for any element of the song to allow the chart creators ample material to challenge players.</em></p>
<p><em>Over the years the boundary of physical skill has been pushed so far out, forcing the music to keep up. The original challenge chart in DDR 1 was PARANOIA, a 180 bpm drum and bass  track, in the most recent release the hardest challenge chart is EGOISM 440.. A (you guessed it) 440 bpm song with hideous amounts of slow downs, beat switches and key changes. With this hellbent focus on physical difficulty, when tracks are removed from their charts they become weird disjointed beasts, never settling into a groove or pattern leaving you adrift in a sea of gabber kicks, too fast to ever dream of dancing Hakken to.</em></p>
<p><em>All tracks chosen for this mix are from mainline Konami games, Dance Dance Revolution, Sound Voltex and Beatmania, with all the tracks being available either on home releases or cabinets. Konami have some of the strictest rules regarding IP and approval, making the fact that these tracks have mostly been created by in house composers all the more bizarre. I often imagine a room full of stock holders nodding along to at Eurobeat version of Mickey Mouse March.</em></p>
<p>A playlist featuring the in game charts is also available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLh-uT091YCPcJCp77k3kKi0AUw3whs5tr">here</a>.</p>
