            <p>DSNT is a multi-disciplined creative company based in Belfast. Given the multifarious domain that the collective work in, they are often somewhat difficult to define. Oisin, the groups spokesman sets the record straight. “It predominantly works on a per-project basis. I usually take a curatorial role on each project and put a team together. We have a Belfast crew that run the parties and help with the label which comprises of Nez, Ryan Dallas, G.Boo &amp; Sebastian.  We couldn’t have put on half of the guests we have done without them. They also help with the A&amp;R and a lot of the music we have signed has been influenced by them.”</p>
<p>Despite the fact the group have a strong foothold in events, their operations include a wide manner of things. Previous engagements have included artist management, events management, record producing, graphic &amp; motion design, filming &amp; editing services, art exhibition curation, visual arts and motion graphics. They recently provided the visual show for Headless Horseman’s appearance at Atonal Festival for example. “It was an amazing experience, one of the highlights of my adult life” Oisin begins. “We worked on it for about four weeks straight, from 10am to 3-5am each night. At the start there was three people in the team working on the visuals and then in the last week we pulled in some extra guns in the form of Carlos Purcell who absolutely smashed it. It was a complete honour to be part of the event and we’re massively grateful at the trust the Horseman placed in our hands to produce something that I feel was really special. Berlin Atonal was the perfect festival, the production &amp; curation of the event was so tight.”</p>
<p>Having been a huge supporter and follower of DSNT for some time now it seemed fitting to invite them to feature in our podcast series, ahead of their third birthday. &quot;In short, if you want to make money, do something else&quot; Oisin begins when asked about the landmark. &quot;Its been an amazing 3 years, great learning experience and an opportunity to meet some really amazing people, probably what I love more than anything is watching the community grow and develop over the past few years.&quot; Summing up the mix as ”Str8 up bangorz all the way”, Nez, the groups nominated DJ for the feature chooses to record in one take, offering a summation of the kind of set typical at DSNT events.</p>
<p>With several parties upcoming to mark the birthday celebrations, the next few weeks seems to be heralding an extra push on all frontiers of the project, as Oisin explains. “After DSNT004 we have an all Irish EP featuring tracks from Sunil Sharpe, AnD, Eomac &amp; Fran Hartnett and to coincide with it we’re collaborating with Irish visual artist Danleo who does pretty sick illustrations.  We’re going to release a line of four t-shirts to coincide with the release (one for each artist) and we’re planning to develop a new visual show to coincide with the release and do a little mini-tour with our visual show &amp; artists. I’m also working on a bunch of other visual shows for various events, namely our upcoming show for Culture Night - Altered State.”</p>
<p><em>DSNT will be joined by Karenn &amp; Sunil Sharpe to celebrate their third birthday on October 10th. Additional info available <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1461252274113496/?ref=48">here</a>.</em></p>
