        <p>The 'Happened' event series began as an offshoot from neo-minimalist imprint, SM-LL. The label is perhaps best known for platforming the more esoteric side of minimalism, championing three key principals: repetition, reduction and reference. The idea of 'Happened' was to bring this music out of the headphones and into the real world. It was a brave move, not least because of the recondite nature of the music. Would anyone be willing to submit their evenings to a few hours of intense experimentalism? Yes, it turns out. And although there is of course a strong cross-over between SM-LL and Happened, the event series is upon to a much broader scope of electronic music, from jungle to gabba to ambient. Since their first event just over a year ago, they have hosted events with Yves de Mey, Shelley Parker, Ewa Justka and Graham Dunning.</p>
<p>Their next event is billed as an ode to experimental music from Taiwan, including performances from Alois Yang, Yen-Tzu Chang, Chiyou Ding and Happened-head-honcho, Lucia H Chung. In preparation for this event, Chiyou Ding has supplied a mix of some of his highlights from the Taiwanese experimental scene. &quot;Throughout this mix, you can hear some field recordings, noise, avant-grade and electronica pieces from different generational artists,&quot; Ding explains. &quot;I hope this mix demonstrates that there are some people doing some weird sounds in this small, sweet potato-shaped island&quot;. It's also worth noting that the majority of these compositions come from Yao Dajuin’s 'Post Concrete' imprint, an important resource for anyone interested in Taiwanese sound art (read more <a href="http://www.digicult.it/digimag/issue-062/yao-dajuin-china-academy-of-art-la-scuola-di-intermedia-art-di-hangzhou/">here</a>). Don't be put off by the opening rendition of Yankee Doodle. As Ding advises, &quot;it’s better to let the pieces tell their own story&quot;. Listen below.</p>
