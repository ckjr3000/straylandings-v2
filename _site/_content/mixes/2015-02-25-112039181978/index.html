        <p>Last week we caught up with Michael Hann, the man behind the mysterious Marreck moniker and head honcho of the nascent <a href="http://rejectandfade.tumblr.com">Reject and Fade</a> imprint. This article comes in the light of his latest LP <em>Ceteology</em>, which was recently released on the criminally overlooked Irish label <a href="http://www.trensmat.com">Trensmat Records.</a> Hann should feel right at home at Trensmat - a label that has held tight to the pillars of experimental music: brave, daring and radical, both Trensmat and Hann’s Ceteology LP capture the essence of noise music and culture in its purist form.</p>
<p>We first became aware of Reject and Fade through the brilliant rkss release <em>Tunnel</em> - out on cassette last year. “Robin is cool as cucumber and deserves a shout out every time!” states Hann. “In the mix I have also dropped in a few demos, as I thought it would be cool to drop in stuff people haven’t heard and who are or are likely to be releasing stuff soon on Reject and Fade. I am being a little non committal as I am not planning on releasing a lot via RnF (maybe only two to three releases a year), so a lot can change between now and whenever. Ideally I would like each release to have a sense of occasion about it and leave people anticipating and hungry for what is coming next.”</p>
<p>Reflecting on the release of <em>Ceteology</em>, Hann has compiled a mix of the influences surrounding the record, ”I kind of put a constraint on myself that I could only use music which I had been listening to when I was making the record but also I didn’t want to chuck in some of the obvious references such as Drexciya” he explains. “I decided I would only use music which I took away with me when I went off to work offshore. What you have here is what I was listening to when I was in between work, thinking about home/trying not to think about home, flying backwards and forwards and: voila…”</p>
