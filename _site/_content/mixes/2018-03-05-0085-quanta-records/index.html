<p>The latest in our mix series comes from newly-formed French imprint, Quanta Records. The label have been in operation for just over two years, beginning as a platform for releases from 'Infinite Fields'. These early EPs are synth-y, high-octane tech-house. But fast forward a few months and the label are about to release some seriously extreme plunderphonic breakcore noise (or 'computer music', for short). So how did we get here?</p>
<p>&quot;I don’t have a musical background&quot;, he begins. &quot;I started listening to a lot of music very young but never properly studied it. I remember going to the library, borrowing some CDs in order to rip them at home, returning them and doing it again. It was almost faster than downloading at that time! I think listening to a lot of music without knowing its theory has helped me develop an approach based on perceptions. I rely on what it makes me feel, what it conveys in terms of sensation. I also like to document my listening, learn about the context of a record, the history of a movement, and the ideas its protagonists were saying&quot;.</p>
