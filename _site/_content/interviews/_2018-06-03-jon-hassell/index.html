<p>First of all, tell us about your new album. What have you been up to these past 9 years? What can we expect it to sound like?</p>
<p>Tell us about the launch of this new label too. What made you want to start a new imprint for its release?</p>
<p>I’m really intrigued by this idea of ‘vertical listening’. It seems like this might be a product of digital processing in the studio (sampling/editing/cropping/automation etc), music now has a much broader capacity to work like a kind of collage (or ‘Pentimento’). How do you think different production techniques have changed music throughout your career?</p>
<p>It seems like ‘vertical listening’ might have some crossover with ‘deep listening’. Where do the two differ? What other kinds of listening do you think are possible (but rarely explored)?</p>
<p>Theodore Gracyk talks about how memory of ‘chromatics’ (timbre/texture in music, or colour/shade in painting) fades faster than our memory of pitch, shape and line. But it those features of sound or painting that are often the most ‘bliss-rich’. To what extent do you think that electronic music’s strength lies in its ability to create interesting textures/timbres rather than melodies/harmonies?</p>
<p>With this new record, it sounds as if the trumpet is less prominent that some of your earlier work. How has your relationship to the instrument changed over the years? Does it still inspire you after all this time?</p>
<p>I was listening to your Fascinoma album again the other day, I particularly love the version of jazz standard 'Caravan' in there. I wanted to ask you a bit about the relationship between jazz and the European avant-garde, I know at one point Miles Davis started reading a lot of Stockhausen for example. To what extent were the two in dialogue in the 20th century?</p>
<p>You have worked with people like Gavin Bryars, Brian Eno and Harold Budd in the past. There is now a wave of new ‘ambient’ artists who cite you as their influence. What are your thoughts on the status of ‘ambient’ today? Where do you think it will go as a genre? Who are you listening to these days?</p>
<p>As someone who studied under Stockhausen, what has it been like seeing his legacy evolve?</p>
<p>Finally, what have you got planned for the release of this album? Do you plan to perform this new album live?</p>
