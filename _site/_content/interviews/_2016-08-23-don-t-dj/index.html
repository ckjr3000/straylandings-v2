            <p>My introduction to Florian Meyer came from the recent Authentic Exoticism EP under his Don’t DJ alias. The EP, released on his new label SEXES, explores ideas of exoticism and hybridization of culture through sound, imagery and text. Meyer himself confesses that his work dwells in problematic territory, risking both misappropriation and offence by discussing the history of exoticism in a modern context. But it's important not to confuse plagiarism for pastiche. His music isn't written to repackage and recontextualise any existing culture. Rather, it pokes fun at the utter obsession electronic music has with <em>the exotic</em>, from 'tribal beats' to 'tropical house'. Ahead of his appearance at Meakusma Festival in Eupen, Belgium, we caught up with Florian to discuss the record, his label, and their theoretical underpinnings.</p>
<p><strong>You recently formed your new label, SEXES. Can you tell us a little bit about the label and why you decided to start it?</strong></p>
<p>FM: Yeah with two friends, Lotte Meret Effinger and Marco Buetikofer. Nowadays music seems quite separate from 'theory', yet this wasn't always the way. We love the old Crass releases where they put out an album with a concept, and tried to get at that concept with the songs, collages, artwork and text. There’s no need to have music separated from theory by principle, besides: some music carries a lot of reference and thus invites us to reflect upon it. Music and theory actually go well together, so we thought we’d aim to bring that back into the electronic music club.</p>
<p><strong>I was intrigued by how you order your releases too. There doesn't seem to be a differentiation between formats: music video was SEXES01, and your EP is SEXES02….</strong></p>
<p>FM: Exactly, there are only two catalog numbers for now, and we hope to add a third soon. But the first was a video that Lotte made, and we deliberately did that as the first one. Music videos nowadays are released for free online, it’s a completely different format and we wanted to manifest  that this label is not limited to releasing records.</p>
<p><strong>You’ll be performing in September at Meakusma Festival in Belgium, what can we expect from you there?</strong></p>
<p>FM: It will be live. I think I played about 15 shows last month, and it naturally developed over time. I’m not bound to doing it the same way every show. If it’s during the week and there aren’t many people, and there's a free-jazz band playing before me, I will not run the techno set. But I can also go more experimental or ambient or whatever I like. But if they put me on at prime time, Saturday night, and there’s techno before and after me, I will deliver happily. I’m not there to tease people: I actually try to please the audience.</p>
<p><strong>I understand you’ve also got a background performing and producing using locked grooves in vinyl, and also etching your own marks into records. Is this something you’re still doing?</strong></p>
<p>FM: Yeah I still do it, I’ve been doing it for so long that it's kind of become the instrument I’m most familiar with. If I want to produce a certain sound, it’s often faster for me to produce it on the record player than search for it in a sound bank or sample it or something.</p>
<p><strong>And you do this within the Don’t DJ project?</strong></p>
<p>FM: Yeah, for producing sounds, or ambience, drones, that kind of thing. The Don’t DJ thing is mostly based on rhythmic experiments, and there’re very few melodic parts in what I do. Recently there has been more melody to it, but rhythm is still pretty much the thing. I sometimes need a little bit more than just drums and bells, so sometimes I will use drones from the record player, and cut them up and use effects. In concerts especially, I actually do use records. I sometimes play them 'by hand', without the motor of the turntable, scratching, or pushing forward very slowly, or going backwards. Sometimes I play them between tracks in the concert. I don’t want to have breaks, but I sort of have to because I load every track as a new project, so I have to close the project in two different programs, and then reload the programs, and during that time I usually play a record. They are treated, or with effects or something but sometimes I just play it actually, just play other people’s records in my live shows.</p>
<p><strong>The artwork for your latest EP, <em>Authentic Exoticism</em>, is certainly provocative. Some would say it verges on absurd. Can you tell us a little bit about the thinking behind this release?</strong></p>
<p>FM: I actually wasn’t in charge of the artwork for the release. I left that pretty much to Lotte and Marco. But I did have some influence, like I showed them some 1950s American exoticism records and they would often have just one 'exotic' instrument on the cover. I sort of liked that, just an instrument in some natural setting, or just onstage without the player.  There's also a double helix that the title is written in, or the USB pattern in the background. There are also all these logos and different kinds of chips, like you get on credit cards and stuff. The logos are mostly Sony, there’s a big VAIO logo, and there’s some other stuff referring to technology.</p>
<p><strong>Am I right in thinking a lot of the music on that EP (and elsewhere) is created algorithmically?</strong></p>
<p>FM: That’s true, in fact, all of it.</p>
<p><strong>Do you find it quite difficult integrating the themes of exoticism into algorithmic composition?</strong></p>
<p>FM: Not at all, I mean that’s kind of the joke of the whole thing. Even Victor Segalen, this French theorist, claims that exoticism is meant to be not only about experiences of the exotic within a geographical meaning, like cultures that are closer to the equator or something. But it's also about encounters of otherness that stem from other differences. Like the difference in time for example, there’s some historic exoticism he points out. Our use of technology and machinery is also something profoundly separated from our realms of experience. So in that way the record has this theme of traditional exoticism but it also plays with the exoticism of technology in the respect that I’m only using algorithms to produce the rhythms. I’m using the algorithms to produce the sounds, even the natural sounds. The bells and stuff are produced by algorithms, namely physical modelling.</p>
<p><strong>Could you explain a bit about physical modelling?</strong></p>
<p>FM:  Basically they’re algorithms which ask you to define the kind of body and the impulse and the other body you want to hit it with, and then it calculates the emerging sound. It has some pseudo-natural ring to it because the sound will change a lot over the course of time because it also calculates the movement of the object after being hit. So if you hit it again, it’s already in motion, so the hit will be different to the first one, which makes it sound quite different in comparison to a sample, yet not necessarily natural, maybe you could call it hyper-natural.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think the EP has been received? Do you think the irony of it has been sufficiently articulated?</strong></p>
<p>FM: I mean I can only say what people tell me, and that was tremendously positive, yet I get very little feedback on the text. Few reviews and few interviews really dig into the text and at those time, it doesn't feel like I made myself very clear. I think the text is quite strange in its own way; it’s maybe less inviting than I hoped. I don’t get many emails saying, “I agree with you on that point but I disagree with you on that point.” There’s not much discussing the text with me, but maybe it takes time. It’s not so long since we published the record. Sometimes these things take time. Also, it’s not so important for me that people actually take up what was important for me when I composed it, I’m also happy if people take up on different aspects of the whole thing. What produced a lot of feedback is that some people saw some penises referenced in the picture on the cover. These things obviously produce feedback quite easily.</p>
<p><strong>So to close up, what can we expect next from you and the SEXES label?</strong></p>
<p>FM: So with releases, what’s coming soon are a few remixes that I‘ve made over the last few months for example a remix for Ogoya Nengo &amp; The Dodo Women's Group, and there will be an LP release out at the end of October. It has a pretty nice cover, I’m really glad about it actually, it raises the value of the whole product for me quite a lot! Robert Beatty of the mighty Hair Police did the cover, and did a really nice job. It’s a gate-fold, I’ve never had a gate-fold, so I’m really happy to see that come into existence. And then on Fullfridge, a French label, there will be a 12” with two tracks. They’re tracks I really like so really looking forward to that. From SEXES, we’re really happy to have Deena Abdelwahed working on an ambitious release that transcends genres and draws from a strong conceptual approach towards contemporary problems - it will be a record but not only a record, exactly how we like it at SEXES. Another release I am really excited about is the first ever publication of a project i have been working on intensely with a good friend (Volker Wiesmann), it is called Paradon't and will publish vinyl through Diskant very soon!</p>
