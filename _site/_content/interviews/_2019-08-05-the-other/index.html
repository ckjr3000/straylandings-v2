        <p><strong>First of all, how have you been these last few months?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been good, recent months have been busy juggling the running of my label, my jobs and musical projects. Sometimes a bit stressful, but I like having a variety of things going on to turn my attention to as I can get bored easily.</p>
<p><strong>What have you been up to since the release of ‘Rawabet'?</strong></p>
<p>A fair bit. ‘Rawabet’ was released at the very beginning of 2017 and since then I’ve played live in numerous places. Australia, Japan, Mutek festival, the killer Saturnalia festival in Milan, a bike shop in Crete and Selfridges department store in London to name a few. The same year I also released an EP called ‘World In Action’ which was recorded the previous summer whilst I was on Jury Duty, hanging around between cases in the waiting room. It came out on vinyl through The Trilogy Tapes and digitally on my own label, ALTER. The following year I released a companion EP of remixes to ‘WIA’ featuring versions by Parris, Low Jack, Laurel Halo, Beneath and Sky H1. EPs tend to fall down the cracks between albums, but I still like the material a lot.</p>
<p><strong>I’m really impressed with this new direction on the album. It’s such an expansive sound, almost orchestral! What were you listening to whilst working on it?</strong></p>
<p>Thanks. I definitely wanted to pursue a “bigger” sound whilst simultaneously retaining a sense of “the other”. It was also important to resist any possible clichés that can arise when incorporating strings into this kind of music. Like, the idea to work with this instrumentation isn’t necessarily original for instance, but my intention was to build in more of an “alien” or fantastical direction which would stay true to the Helm aesthetic somewhat.</p>
<p>Music wise, I found myself listening to a lot of progressive rock which definitely influenced the decision to include a broader range of instruments. ‘Red’ and ‘Starless and Bible Black’ by King Crimson are old favourites I rediscovered when I began to work on the record. ‘Cottonwoodhill’ by Brainticket was another that cropped up again as well – there’s an element of disorientation I associate with that record which definitely helped shape a couple of the tracks on there. A lot of music by friends as well. Loke Rahbek was making his new Croatian Amor record and we sent each other various drafts, back and forth, of what we were working on. We discussed length a lot. Lee Gamble released his “Mnestic Pressure” album and I was really impressed with the general flow of that record. The way it shifts throughout the course of its duration, never staying in one place for too long but yet remains a really concise piece of work.</p>
<p>I feel I should mention “Beat” by Bowery Electric as well – particularly the track “Fear of Flying” – as it was in some regard a catalyst for me to start the process of recording. Those kind of 90’s trip-hop beats with rushing euphoric noise seemed appealing for some reason. “World In Action” was somewhat my attempt at making an “Illbient” record but in a Helm style, partly in tribute to groups like Bowery Electric, Techno Animal, Scorn, etc…some of the first “heavy” electronic music I’d heard. I guess a lot of that music sounds a bit dated now due to the technology and means of production but there was something perversely enjoyable about trying to do my own take on it.</p>
<p>I’d originally intended “Chemical Flowers” to be an extension of that idea, but it didn’t really manifest in that way. Probably for the better!</p>
<p><strong>I love how different ‘I Knew You Would Respond’ sounds from your earlier work. It almost sounds like a Swans track. Can you tell us a little bit about the recording process for this? Are those programmed or live drums, for example?</strong></p>
<p>Not a Swans fan personally, but I can see what you mean by the comparison. It’s a mixture of sampled and live instruments. I played some extra percussion to add a bit more depth.</p>
<p><strong>I realise you have had two albums out since ‘Olympic Mess’, but this does feel like something of a follow-up to that record. Not least because of the return to PAN. To what extent do you think this new record is a sibling of ‘Olympic Mess’?</strong></p>
<p>It is the follow up to ‘Olympic Mess’! ‘Rawabet’ was a live recording and ‘World In Action’ was an EP put together remotely on my iPad. “Chemical Flowers” is the first full studio record since then and a line can be drawn directly between the two.</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell us about the string arrangements, and working with JG Thirlwell? How did that come about? What was it like working with an arranger like that?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been a big fan of Thirlwell for years. The Foetus albums were ahead of their time in some way and listening to them now is a confounding experience. God knows how he made them, the process is inscrutable to me! It felt like a direct response to what Suicide did, turning rock’n’roll on its head and inside out too, in a more extreme / experimental manner.</p>
<p>I was thrilled to discover that JG had included ‘Olympic Mess’ in a list of his favourite albums of 2015. Our mutual friend Drew McDowall introduced us over e-mail and I knew he had some experience of working with strings from his Manorexia project and Zola Jesus. So he was the first person that popped into my head when I came up with the idea and luckily was into it.</p>
<p><strong>I feel like there are quite a few naturalistic components on this record. There’s the opening sounds on ‘Lizard in Fear’, what sounds like running water on 'Leave Them All Behind’, and of course the name of the album itself, ‘Chemical Flowers’. Can you tell us a bit about your relationship to nature and how nature is included within your music? Was this intentional?</strong></p>
<p>The idea of using natural sounds and blurring the lines between those and electronic sound sources is something that’s been present in my work as Helm since day one. Some of the sounds you mentioned are naturalistic in their origins, yet others are derived through means of electronic production. No matter which direction my work shifts in, the intention is always to create something that sounds organic yet not always directly referential to the sources. Of course there are instruments used which can be easily identified, like strings for instance, but the bigger picture is one I like the listener to be able to project interpretation onto. The end result being one where many of the sounds used are detached and disassociated from their original contexts, even the strings to some extent.</p>
<p><strong>I think my favourite piece on the album is ‘Leave Them All Behind’. I love the sleepy, hallucinogenic mood that it has. In the press release, it mentions the ‘nocturnal nature of the recording process’. Can you maybe expand upon this? Was the album recorded primarily at night? Was this deliberate?</strong></p>
<p>Partly deliberate, it’s more about creating a relaxed environment for recording where I feel like I can do anything I want. The studio I use to record in is located on a farm in a rural part of suburban Essex. I would book it for three days in a row, working from 10am until 4am the next day, sleeping there in-between. I love the process and it puts me in a particular mindset which enables me to focus. I’ve always enjoyed recording at night and it’s often when the best work happens. There are less distractions, more solitude, my concentration is generally better, there’s greater potential for heightened atmosphere and all of these things can help with the end result. Not everything recorded gets used, or even leads to anything substantial. You can sometimes go through frustrating periods where you’re working on something for a long time, yet something isn’t clicking and you can’t understand why. Identifying what does work and knowing what to edit and discard is part of the process. I cut back quite a lot from the first draft of the record which made it easier to identify the elements I felt were the most effective. I was able to work on those parts, building more of an emphasis on them through much more meticulous and detailed methods than I have used before…sometimes to an annoying extent! But yeah, without the right environment set I wouldn’t have been able to go that extra mile required I don’t think.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, what are your plans for the rest of the year? Do you intend on playing some of this material live?</strong></p>
<p>I generally take things as they come, one step at a time. I am working on new material, some of which will be used for a performance by a dance company in 2020. I am touring North America with Blanck Mass this Autumn and have a few shows in the UK and Europe before then. Me and JG Thirlwell are also trying to work out a way of presenting some of this material live with string quartets in different locations, though it depends on logistics, budget and also interest from promoters.</p>
