        <p>After a fairly radical revamp of his sound, Paleman has been taking the UK bass scene by storm, with a series of hard hitting, immaculately produced Techno stompers. His most recent upload ‘Hunt’ remains characteristically solid, encapsulating many of the UK Techno characteristics being pushed by labels such as ‘Swamp 81’ or ‘Clone Basement Series’ at the moment. ‘Hunt’ seems to take a midpoint between several other Paleman tracks, retaining the pounding rhythms of ‘All Good’ whilst incorporating some of the more interesting tribal sounds used in ‘Sun Dance’. The track also features some infectious vocal samples, riding in and out alongside techy stabs, snapping dry snares and a rather enchanting marimba melody sitting at the back of the mix.</p>
<p>Given 19 year old Calum Lee’s mastery of UK tinged Techno, its hardly surprising he’s managed to bag himself an upcoming show at Swamp 81’s night on the 5th march hosted by ‘Hit &amp; Run’, alongside truly titanic names such as Boddika, Loefah and Oneman just to name a few. Amongst the upcoming shows, as well as a guest mix for Mary Anne Hobbes, Paleman has a forthcoming 12” on ‘Fulcrum Records’, a new label being put together by Damu.</p>
