        <p>In its original form, <em>Cannibal Mécanique</em> has been around since 2014. Constructed by multimedia artist Victoria Keddie, the piece began life as a data-moshed, psychedelic amalgamation of electronic music, choreography and lo-fi VHS visual manipulations performed at New York's Museum of Art &amp; Design.</p>
<p>Recently, Angus Tarnawsky's In Context Music imprint took it upon themselves to issue a reworked version of the audio components of <em>Cannibal Mécanique</em> on a limited series of 7&quot; lathe records. ICM saw a bit of a hiatus cross 2016, so it's great to see them back in force, releasing five new works of consistently high quality across this year.</p>
<p>This latest offering is littered with buzzing, amp-driven distortions and wild, screeching tape echoes, like a Rrose release only available on a 1960's TV set. Both sides seem to be alterations on the same theme, stuttered sine-wave techno and de-saturated, Sähkö reminiscent modulations both recurring textures.</p>
<p>Keddie's a-side sees dusty overdrive resonances tremoloing alongside contorted dial-tones, while the b-side feels like a much subdued, basement-dwelling relative. Grainy beaters and stalled-engine sound design make for a brooding, hypnotic listen, developing slowly to a malfunctioned close.</p>
<p>In its lathe cut form at least, <em>Cannibal Mécanique</em> calls to mind Francis Ford Coppola's wire-tap thriller, <em>The Conversation</em> for me.  Not least for the static-laced, in-and-out-of-focus feel it maintains, but also for the fact both sides build to disconcerting climaxes, leaving the listener unnerved and disoriented.</p>
