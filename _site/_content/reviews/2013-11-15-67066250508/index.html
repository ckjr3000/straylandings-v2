<p><strong>Label:</strong> <a href="http://caduceus-records.com/">Caduceus Records</a>
<br><strong>Format:</strong> 12”/Digital

<p>Oliver Deutschmann has become something of a household name over the past few years. With records as brilliant as 2011’s ‘Trump’ EP with Ed Davenport, as well as a continued residency at the Berghain, we can surely expect Deutschmann to deliver top quality jams well into the foreseeable future. Indeed, his latest EP, ‘Breakdown’, is a perfect example of his mastery, and shows us that he is far from out of steam.</p>
<p>The EP opens with unapologetic vigor, as enormous 4X4 pulses provide the foundation for ‘Breakdown’s rich 303 lines and hypnotic vocal loops. This is what Deutschmann does best: executing ambitious and busy soundscapes with masses of adrenaline-filled dynamic force. Steve Rachmad’s remix is brilliant in its own right, using a more refrained and understated sound to create those euphoric peaks of dizzying height. This could well be my favourite on the EP.</p>
<p>‘Braineater’ on the other hand is a hyperactive jaw-clenching burst of energy, always keeping one step ahead of the listener. Tobias, Dettmann and Suckut all spring to mind on this one, as the soft, saintly pads faintly provide a backdrop for the twisted analogue lines and frantic drum machine patterns that move this thing forward. LAD’s remix is considerably more subdued, although it is no less powerful. Providing a subtle shuffle to the beat, the groove bounces along effortlessly, and functions wonderfully as the EP’s closing thought.</p>
<p>For anyone with even a cursory interest in modern-sounding proggy techno, Oliver Deutschmann is definitely a place worth visiting, and this latest EP serves as another great installment in a long series of excellent releases.</p>
