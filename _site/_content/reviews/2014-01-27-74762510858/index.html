        <p><strong>Label:</strong> <a href="http://www.fifthwallrecords.com/">Fifth Wall</a>
<br><strong>Format:</strong> 12”/Digital
<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 28/01/2014</p>
<p>It’s been a little while since the last release from Cambridge based producer Metrist. This said, from the sounds of his latest 12” for Divvorce &amp; Hound Scales’ Fifth Wall imprint, this time hasn’t been spent idly - the five track EP displays an impressively refined take on the Metrist sound, which has matured significantly since his debut on Nineteen89 Records early last year.</p>
<p>The ‘Doorman In Formant’ EP see’s Metrist voyage into the deeper recesses of experimental Techno. Glitchy, mechanical sound-design takes centre stage, whilst still managing to prove effective in terms of functionality with a stripped back, spartan outlook on percussion.</p>
<p>Opening track ‘Third Law’ sets the tone with hollow industrial textures which remain a dominating feature throughout the EP. A minute in and the track hints at developing into something more melodic with fuzzed out chords, before sharply cutting back to Metrist’s oddball mix of grating drums &amp; R2D2 beeps and bleeps.</p>
<p>We are also offered a sullen remix from Lakker member Eomac which takes a deeper, more introspective approach, introducing muffled swathes of reverent organ. Eomac also deconstructed the track’s percussive elements, leaving a dampened, skeletal variant on the original’s muscular groove.</p>
<p>Despite the fact  that ‘Doorman in Formant’ is undoubtedly a techno release, third track ‘Lofstrom’ is the only offering to  make use of traditional four to the floor rhythms; sharp bleeps and bursts of computer noise helping propel the track rhythmically.</p>
<p>Heaving, oddball percussive workout ‘Leviathanks’ follows this; discordant stabs blasting through stuttered, brokenbeat drums and swelling drones. Percussion is layered up slowly rasping hi-hats clattering through the mix before fading away at equal pace.</p>
