        <p>Sissel Wincent’s tracks feels like bass music without the waffle. Her productions are focused and considered — only elements that are 100% necessary make the final cut. I was lucky enough to catch her set at Norbergfestival a couple of years ago. She delivered her factory percussion with such force that the venue ceiling raining dust down from the ceiling. I was later informed that this was actually pigeon shit.</p>
<p>Her latest offering on Peder Mannerfelt’s eponymous label suggests she won’t be changing her ways anytime soon. <em>Inspirational Quotes</em> delivers characteristically claustrophobic scaffold techno to brutal effect. ‘Cynical’, for example, has distortion coursing through its veins. Crumpled low-end kicks build to a charging forward stomp, corrosive modem soundscapes trembling in the backdrop. ‘Ponytails’ on the other hand fragments gabber tonalities into an eerie industrial half-stepper, foundation-quaking blasts of synthesis rising between rusted steel percussion and whistling sine tones.</p>
<p>There is a sense that all these tracks verge on malfunctioning — off-kilter rhythms and skewed melodics never quite gain a settled footing. ‘Yellow Lines’ feels jaunty and unhinged, warning siren bleeps and callous drums churning in awkward syncopation. Then there are tracks like ‘Still Undetermined’, which takes on a ‘90s Warp quality with squelching modulations and glistening Drexciyan chord progressions escalating right until the tracks close.</p>
<p>In an interview with Resident Advisor, Peder Mannerfelt previously revealed how Paul Purgas of Emptyset began encouraging him to release tracks which seemed half-finished in his eyes. The move has been a stunning success for Mannerfelt, and it appears this all thriller no filler approach is proving equally apt for Wincent. <em>Inspirational Quotes</em> is a release of great depth and character, and I look forward to seeing her next move.</p>
