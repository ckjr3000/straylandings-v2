        <p>It all sounds a bit precious bodily fluids from the title. The themes of Cold War angst in Stanley Kubrick's masterful satire, <em>Dr. Strangelove</em> might not be a bad place to start in fact when talking about 'The Rise of Liquid Alternatives', the latest release from Brussels-based Orphan Swords. Making up the debut offering on 'Nurse', the EP is packed to the brim with paranoia and disturbed mechanics.</p>
<p>Orphan Swords was formed in 2013 by Bozar Music &amp; Arts Festival founder Pierre de Muelenaere and Yannick Franck, the owner of the Idiosyncratics label. The pair have become something of an artist's choice when it comes to the industrial/techno crossover, perhaps best illustrated by their collaboration with cult New York darkwave band, Ike Yard.</p>
<p>While remaining firmly in keeping with their back catalogue, there are some new nuances to this latest release. 'The Risk of Liquid Alternatives' has a sharper, more precise feel to it when compared to the ramshackle drums of a release like <em>Weehawken</em>, a mini-album released earlier this year.</p>
<p>'Glaysa Labolas' for example sees razor-edge glitches and pointed blasts of sub almost reminiscent of something from Senking, or Alva Noto &amp; Byetone's Diamond Version project. By the end however the track has been doused in echoes and reverbs, clattering percussion and wailing vocals moving the offering into hallucinatory realms.</p>
<p>The release's second offering, 'Forneus', takes a more leftfield approach still, reverberating plastic drums pummeling out low hollow resonances alongside groaning synthetics.</p>
<p>As a debut offering from Nurse, 'The Rise of Liquid Alternatives' makes a promising start. Orphan Swords' amalgamation of crisp, mechanical electronics and something more wild and unrestrained positions the label to move in a number of different directions, and I'm greatly looking forward to seeing which path they choose.</p>
