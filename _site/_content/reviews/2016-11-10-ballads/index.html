<p>There are two ways to approach psycho-acoustics. You can, 1) Study the perception of sound or; 2) Create sounds to alter perception. Ashley Bellouin does a bit of both. Having worked with both Dave Smith and the late Don Buchla, she is a disciple of radical electronics. She recently designed her own instruments, most notably a variation on Benjamin Franklin’s glass harmonica and a curious structure known as HEADPSPACE: a hexagonal cylinder suspended by strings, amplifying the vibrations of wind. So in this sense, Bellouin falls into the first camp.</p>
<p>But she is also a musician in equal measure. Lifting ideas from psycho-acoustics (spatialisation, beat frequencies, auditory illusions), she implants hallucinatory effects within pieces of introspective drone. Not as a novelty, but as an artistic device. Just as her instruments aim to displace traditional forms of listening, the music of Ashley Bellouin requires a special kind of ear. One that is robust to mystery and transfiguration.</p>
<p>Her debut vinyl, <em>Ballads</em>, presents two sidelong pieces, 'Bourdon' and 'Hummen', pieced together like clasped hands. 'Bourdon' takes as its focus a harmonium and the mellifluous Sequential Prophet 6, an instrument Bellouin helped to develop at Dave Smith. 'Hummen' by contrast explores the extraterrestrial frequencies of her custom-build glass harmonica. She is also joined by Ben Bracken and Teddy Rankin-Parker, embellishing the pieces with tones from electric guitar and cello, respectively. Although seemingly minimal in composition, an attentive listen to this album reveals painstaking micro-tonal and harmonic shifts that creep steadily into ear shot. Unsurprising then, that this was not the product of some spontaneous live jam, but the conclusion of a three-year project.</p>
<p>Music like this puts a time-stamp on the now. It staves off the future and widens the present. It makes possible the ability to observe ones surroundings  by bringing the world closer to the mind.   I therefore believe that the name ‘Ballads’ must be being used with some level of irony. Although there is plenty of romance in this music, it’s a far cry from the pompous sentimentality of narrative opera. It's not recounting unrequited love nor dwelling in nostalgia. Where ballads adopt a garish, undignified display of emotion, <em>Ballads</em> meditates in patience.</p>
