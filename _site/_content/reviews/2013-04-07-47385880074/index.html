<p><strong>Label:</strong><a href="http://novafuture-blog.com/"> </a><a href="http://decoyrecords.tk/">Decoy Records</a><br>
<br><strong>Format:</strong> Limited 12”
<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 08/04/13</p>
<p>Chris Page’s latest release for Rebekah’s Decoy imprint ‘Corpus Delicti’, highlights his prowess as a DJ is far from wasted on his productions. Structurally, both the originals suggest he has a strong awareness of where his music fits, and the patience with which he develops each, makes the payoffs all the more satisfying.</p>
<p>Opener, ‘Counterfeit Innovator’ is a tastefully restrained big-room jam, utilising subtle atmospherics, alongside a repetitive, gnarled synth-line. Page’s twisted hook slowly mutates as the track progresses, underpinned by a chugging rhythmic undercurrent. The tracks beatific elements are minimal yet effective, slightly off-grid hats solidified by sullen, stomping kicks.</p>
<p>The original is barely recognisable through Chris Finke’s take on the track, shaking free of the original’s malignant synth-line in favour of ’90s minimal indebted stylings. Incessant drums are driven by piercing high end, quantising Page’s originally fairly free, swung hats. The original’s distorted riff is replaced with a frantic melody, helping complement Finke’s beatific variations, and heightening the tracks claustrophobic atmosphere.</p>
<p>The b-side offerings take a more direct approach to ‘Counterfeit Innovator’ and its equivalent remix, and are generally more instantly gratifying. This isn’t to say that they lack in the sonic subtlety of the a-side, but the builds are less drawn-out, and the rhythms feel weightier and more defined. ‘Corpus Delicti’ deploys low pitched vocals alongside swarming hats and a modulated bass-line, swelling between Page’s pounding four to the floor kicks.</p>
<p>Comparatively, Jamie Roberts’ (aka Blawan’s) interpretation of ‘Corpus Delicti’ remains truer to the original than Finke’s rework of ‘Counterfeit Innovator’, albeit by a small margin. Whilst keeping a firm grip on Page’s gristled bass, Roberts reconstructs the track’s percussive elements into a frenetic, clattering mess. Similarly to Finke’s remix, Roberts also straightens out the original’s steady groove, taking a more confrontational approach.</p>
<p>Corpus Delicti may only be Page’s fourth release to date, yet proves his prowess as a producer extends far beyond what this short discography may suggest.</p>
