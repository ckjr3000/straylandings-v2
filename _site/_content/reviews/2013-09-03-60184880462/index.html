<p><strong>Label:</strong> <a href="http://echoesfromtheabyss.bandcamp.com/">Echoes From The Abyss</a>
<br><strong>Format:</strong> Digital
<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 06/08/13</p>
<p>Dublin based imprint Echoes From The Abyss seem to have a knack for finding artists whose talents lie beyond their acclaim - scrolling down their Soundcloud page few of the names are recognisable, yet the quality of their releases are definitely notable.</p>
<p>The third release in the series can definitely be considered as a strengthening of this brand, not least for the fact that it features Stray Landings favourite, Preston based Stephen Pelling, otherwise known as MagneticNW.</p>
<p>From the opening minutes of the dark, groove-laden ‘Landfall’, one might hazard a guess that the track would work itself into a fairly regular percussive workout. However under the guidance of Pelling’s menacing sci-fi chords, the track is pushed in a more brooding, introspective direction, despite the fact that ticking hats and off-kilter percussion retain the propulsive appeal of its opening section.</p>
<p>Reportedly a tribute to Modeo’s love of Japanese culture, ‘Three Hundred Seconds Over Tokyo’ brings to mind early-hours rushes of euphoria, contrasting blissful, soporific melodic work with a frantic breakbeat rhythms, bathed in distortion.</p>
<p>Mael’s ‘Bite’ is a strong contender for the most direct approach taken on the EP, mixing a weighty four to the floor stomp with a 90s indebted, twisted acid synth-line. Whilst the formula may be simple, the way in which Mael structures the track is really quite impressive, crafting tasteful buildups and breakdowns from its various elements over a near nine minute duration.</p>
<p>Overall, Echoes From The Abyss 003 presents an impressive collage showing how creative and diverse techno can be, whilst remaining within a coherent and cohesive framework.</p>
