        <p>Variations of the word 'fragment' crop up a lot with Ukrainian imprint FF'Space. The label's title itself is a flexible acronym, standing for either 'First Frequency Space' or 'Frame Fragmented Space'. Given that each track title is a play on the word 'fragment', I would imagine <em>A Hectic Truer</em>, the latest of Yu Miyashita's LP's under his Yaporigami guise fits the latter camp. The album sounds like the brooding, estranged cousin of his <em>Hertzian</em> LP and indeed, as the material for <em>A Hectic Truer</em> was written around the same time period back in 2012, this seems plausible.</p>
<p>Deploying characteristically oddball, Raster-Noton like aesthetics, Miyashita has presented an LP which incorporates his interest in processing samples to their outermost limits with dancefloor sensibilities incredibly effectively. Track's like 'Fragmentary' or 'Fragmenting' feature limber, cut-stop sampling heavily, subtle glitches and electrical whirrings complementing Miyashita's crystal clear blasts of sub-bass.</p>
<p>At times Miyashita's glitch-processing becomes increasingly ferocious. 'Fragmental' for example darts between static doused sounds, as if flicking through TV channels at an exceedingly impatient rate.  The result is a vaguely familiar of Alva Noto &amp; Anne James-Chaton's 'Uni-Acronym', but tailored for the club. The track snakes mechanically, twitching atmospherics and stumbling kicks dancing around Miyashita's skeletal vocal sampling.</p>
<p>The crossover with Miyashita's <em>Hertzian</em> material becomes increasingly obvious at given moments. Take the loose slink of 'Fragment' or 'Fragmentarily's growling motor sounds and shattered glass textures. These are incredibly familiar with the tonal palette used across <em>Hertzian</em>, however rather than feeling reconstituted, the result is to draw Miyashita's varied works into a framework where sounds are shared and reused as a tasteful nod to his past work.</p>
<p>Where its titles are variations on the same word, sonically the same concept fits across <em>A Hectic Truer</em>. Miyashita maintains a feeling of mechanical efficiency, creeping factory sounds and buoyant low-end providing the framework for each offering. Despite the fact the material was written around time of <em>Hertzian</em>, <em>A Hectic Truer</em> still feels fresh for Miyashita, and as his bank of previous releases attests, its always a pleasure to hear something new.</p>
