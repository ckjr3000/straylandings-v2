        <p>The first time I listened to Swan Meat, it was sound-tracking some of the worst flight turbulence I’ve ever experienced; the match seemed oddly fitting. Hailing from Washington DC, she has carved a path for herself with little regard for the sobriety of many contemporary electronic music circles. With the aesthetic of a college metal band, her work is part absurdist humour, part epiphanic realisations.</p>
<p>The latest release sees her team up with Japanese producer Yoshitaka Hikawa, delivering four jolting explorations into glitch, ambient, trap and a whole lot more. ‘Knife Splits Ice’ is available as a cassette via Apothecary Compositions, featuring fittingly unsettling artwork by Monia Ben Hamouda.</p>
<p>As a whole the release feels as if it has been crushed and reassembled several times over; the duo have co-opted a startling array of sample sources from the expected found sounds and distortion clad rhythms, to some wickedly contorted pop and R&amp;B references. 'Nightmare aftercare' for example is a host of twitching abstractions, breaking into raucous sample butchery in its second half. The approach is DIY and unconcerned with polishing the rough edges, giving it a wild and unhinged feel.</p>
<p>Tin pipe rhythms and warped vocals a recurrent theme. 'Casual Surgical Slang' skips and stutters between cleansing pulses of low-end and faltering glitches, while 'No, no, no' feels like being spiked with acid at a swingers party. Fractal modulations and heavily processed dulcet tones work in odd contortions beneath the repeated &quot;no bra, no panties&quot; spoken interjections.</p>
<p>One thing that had surprised me is how direct and confrontational the release is, given it is so abstract. '&amp; wrench aught of death' makes a good example of this interplay, breaking into power-synth stabs and tool-shed halfstep after several minutes of faded-afterparty chatter and super-stretched industrial tones.</p>
<p>It takes a great deal of confidence to try and align the different approaches taken on 'Knife Splits Ice', and an even greater deal of skill to carry it off so successfully.</p>
