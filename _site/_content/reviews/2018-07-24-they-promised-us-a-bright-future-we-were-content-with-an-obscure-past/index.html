        <p>Paul Régimbeau, aka Mondkopf, is a producer I had come to associate with some of the most corrupt techno I’d ever heard. Together with Guillaume Heuguet, he founded In Paradisum in 2011, quietly championing a basement-dwelling, tape-chewed approach to dancefloor genres. Their catalogue includes early output from the likes of Low Jack and Qoso, not to mention Régimbeau’s own productions, charged with distorted post-punk angst.</p>
<p>His new collaborative project, ‘Good Luck In Death’, with Lebanese artist Charbel Haber would suggest something of a spiritual rebirth has taken place. In comparison, their <em>They Promised Us a Bright Future, We Were Content with an Obscure Past</em> release is a cathartic, sermon-like listen, a quietly emotive exploration into psychotropic epiphanies. 'Mystery Malaise and Eternal Spleen' makes for an ethereal opener, cascading synthscapes and imposing drones working to a tremoring, introspective close.</p>
<p>'Fortune Telling Breeze' on the other hand calls to mind the unsettled kosmische and grinding slow-motion electronics of Klaus Schulze or Tangerine Dream, sun-basked power-ambient enveloping the listener in a blanket of stretched-out choral textures. Meanwhile, 'Unforgettable Cabaret Nights' creates a spine-tingling Lovecraftian narrative, warbling organ tones and swirling melancholia drifting hazily across the stereo-field.</p>
<p>Régimbeau and Haber voyage deep into the inner psyche with this latest release, while maintaining a light touch in their treatment of acoustic and choral timbres. It is a subtle, patiently developing work, reminiscent of Popol Vuh's soundtracks for Werner Herzog films like <em>Heart of Glass</em> or <em>Aguirre, The Wrath of God</em>,  but carried off with their own unique sense of presence.</p>
