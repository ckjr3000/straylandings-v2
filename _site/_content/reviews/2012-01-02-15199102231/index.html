        <p>Earlier this month, the blogosphere was blessed with a mass of new material put out by two independent websites – Life Crushed and That’s Deck. The compilation titled ‘Universal Hymns’ covers all manner of future garage, dubstep and basically anything innovative. A personal highlight, Monolith, comes from Portuguese producer Chainless. Following on from his first release,“Blue Days EP”, which came out in October 2011, Chainless again reminds us of how diverse UK-influenced dance music has become.</p>
<p>Monolith is a 2-minute burst of a digital nightmare. Sprinkled with 8-bit bleeps and warbling synth chirps, it falls like raining drops of green matrix-style code in a Syd Mead landscape. The gutsy grime beat moves underneath, one step at a time, like a sea-monster against the current, held together with spacious clicks and snaps. An obvious comparison to make with Chainless’ music is to London genre-defying producer Zomby, especially his latest EP, <em>Nothing.</em> It’s certainly clear that both producers have one goal in mind, <em>atmosphere.</em> Everything else is secondary.</p>
<p>However, it’s unfair to call Chainless just a Zomby-wannabe, Zomby himself only developed this sound recently, a huge departure from his rave-throwback sound of <em>Where were you in ’92?</em> Instead, we should just say that both are working on a different aesthetic plain from most, teasing out and enlivening flavours we simply have never tasted.</p>
