<p><strong>Label:</strong><a href="http://novafuture-blog.com/"> </a><a href="http://decoyrecords.tk/">Decoy Records</a><br>
<br><strong>Format:</strong> Limited 12”
<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 29/07/13</p>
<p>Considering the imprint is only four releases deep, Rebekah-fronted Decoy Records have carved out an impressively coherent sound for themselves. The latest release in the series comes from Northern Irish sisters Lisa &amp; Alice Wallace, deepening Decoy’s explorations into slow building, gritty warehouse techno.</p>
<p>The adrenaline charged ‘Condemner’ kicks off the EP at full force, as pulsating low-end subs and rippling hats push the track forwards under a jarring, dissonant drone that gradually builds to the drop, a good three and half minutes into the track.</p>
<p>It is worth taking note of how frenzied both ‘Condemner’ and subsequent track ‘Sporadicus’ feel, especially considering the fact that both tracks operate around the conventional 125bpm mark - neither seem a far cry in terms of energy from something like Regis’ Blood Into Gold release.</p>
<p>The EP’s hectic pace is somewhat lessened through closing track ‘Everest’, although this isn’t to say the track loses anything in terms of power, as the track sees a jaunty, roughneck bassline suddenly licked into shape by choppy percussion and slow-filtered rising atmosphere drones.</p>
<p>From the tracks propellant opening, one might hazard a guess the track would develop into the sort of crunchy house appropriated by the likes of Delroy Edwards, or Kyle Hall - however, Everest is long form techno, and as the track progresses the L.A.W sister’s hissing, Rrose style atmospheres begin to assert their dominance.</p>
