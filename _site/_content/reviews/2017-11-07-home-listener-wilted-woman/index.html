        <p><a href="http://straylandings.co.uk/podcasts/0070-chloe-frieda">Chloe Frieda</a>'s 'Alien Jams' imprint presents <em>Home Listener</em>, the new EP from Wilted Woman. For the past five years, Alien Jams has been growing as a platform for &quot;strange and beautiful sounds&quot;. First with their fortnightly NTS show and then a flurry of left-field 12&quot;s, including music from <a href="http://straylandings.co.uk/podcasts/112039181978">Marreck</a>, <a href="http://straylandings.co.uk/reviews/cutoff">rkss</a> and a split between <a href="http://straylandings.co.uk/podcasts/0070-chloe-frieda">Beatrice Dillon &amp; Karen Gwyer</a>. As the name suggests, Alien Jams presents dance music, grooves to &quot;jam&quot; to, but not as we know it. Each release holds an ethereal strangeness, which puts it right at the brink of dance-floor acceptability.  The imprint synthesises the falsely-dichotomised 'brain-music' &amp; 'body-music'. After all, we shouldn't have to choose.</p>
<p>I first encountered Wilted Woman at a <a href="http://straylandings.co.uk/articles/that-time-when-siren">SIREN</a> showcase in February, hosted in the now closed '1 Silver Road', a former industrial water tank in Lewisham. The walls here are orange with rust and the air inside is dead and cold. It was a fitting venue for an artist who incorporates music concrète and static noise into her sets. Her music has a dead, bitter, hopeless quality. A sound she describes as &quot;graveyard soundscapes&quot; or “anxiety rhythm”.</p>
<p>This new EP continues this icy anxiety, and opens with the appropriately named 'Heating Problem'. Indeed, the 'Home' in <em>Home Listener</em> is far from the warmth of domestic familiarity. It is an alien place, closer to the home of E.T or the dreamlike surrealism of <em>La Planète Sauvage</em>. It sounds like a spaceship control panel gone awol. Synthesisers oscillate wildly and arpeggios accelerate into the next dimension. Even the artwork looks like some ambiguous Martian goo.</p>
<p>Alien Jams will be hosting the <em>Home Listening</em> launch party on November 11th at The Waiting Room. Tickets can be bought <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1023766">here</a>.</p>
