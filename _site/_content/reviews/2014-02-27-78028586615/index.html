        <p><strong>Label:</strong> <a href="http://www.hypercolour.co.uk/">Hypercolour</a>
<br><strong>Format:</strong> CD/12”/Digital
<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 24/02/2014</p>
<p>There seem to be precious few producers managing to retain a sense of humour in their music these days; a fact which makes Kris Wadsworth’s latest LP, _Popularity, _all the more refreshing. With his Uranus label project having been a remarkable success given its low-key publicity campaign over 2013, Wadsworth has returned to previous home Hypercolour for this release, yet the hallmarks of his solo project have definitely left their mark. _S_panning ten tracks of sleazy mediations between house &amp; techno, the record is instantly recognisable as Wadsworth by the squelching acid basslines, and raw, muscular rhythms which provided the blueprint for the three Uranus releases so far.</p>
<p>The crossover is perhaps most evident on ‘Hot Karl’, its languid, slurring bassline supported by booming 4/4 drums and dust-laden high-end percussion. Following track ‘Cock Soup’ follows a similar format, sauntering rhythms interlocked in a hazy sway with Wadsworth’s throbbing buzz of low-end.</p>
<p>Whilst these and tracks such as ‘Evolove’ or the croaking, dub-tinged ’Verhexen’ feel dream-like with their lethargic pace and dense misty textures, Wadsworth manages to explore a range of themes without deviating from the format of groove-laden house drums and warped 303 synth-work. ‘Neo Nasty’ for example puts an electro edge on the sound; a kaleidoscope of twisting melodies and buoyant stuttered percussion call to mind some of Murk’s early productions.</p>
<p>Where ‘Neo Nasty’ propels itself into space with its psychedelic hook, ‘Public Relations’ brings you back to earth with a resounding thump. Booming kicks plod forward whilst a gravelly vocal drawls ‘he’s so kind, he’s so gentle’ above a contorted bass which is neither of those things. It’s tracks like this where Wadsworth is arguably most in his element; the combination of his partly rugged, partly playful idiosyncrasies is nothing short of infectious.</p>
<p>_Popularity _manages to mark a pivotal point in Wadsworth’s career rather succinctly whilst managing to have plenty of fun along the way; as mentioned previously the traits of his Uranus project have left a defining stamp on the album, yet with the slightly freer format of a full length release, Wadsworth is here able to indulge a side of his productions rarely showcased.</p>
