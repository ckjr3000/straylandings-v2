        <p>I know hmurd best for their work as a curator at Music Hackspace, and as the DJ that played Faithless tunes in the small hours at the now defunct and possibly legendary Crabs nights. I always thought of Crabs like as a bit like that Sex Pistols gig in Manchester where there were supposedly only 40 or so people there, but among them individuals who would go on to start bands like The Fall, Joy Division and so on. Whether hmurd classifies as Johnny Rotten or Tony Wilson in this analogy I'm not sure, but his <em>Boycott Ethical Consumption</em> EP on Tobago Tracks certainly feels like a salient moment.</p>
<p>Title track 'clip that [club mix]' is a particularly innovative piece of dancefloor hybridisation. Borrowing samples from shelob's mate's hazy reimagining of Underworld's 'Born Slippy' â€“ 'cerin amroth',  the track calls to mind Ripatti's headspinning footwork collaborations with Twwth.</p>
<p>'Shepard's Delight' adds new levels of anxiety to Ricardo Villalobos' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=7wjx_muAHLg">greatest joke</a>.</p>
