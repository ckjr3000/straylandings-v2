        <p>An evasive new up and comer, Boxwork boasts airplay from the likes of XFM &amp; Rinse, with support from the likes of <a href="http://www.maryannehobbs.com/">Mary Anne Hobbs</a>, whose recommendations should rarely be ignored. One of his most recent uploads, ‘Like Her Right There’ twists drugged out synths alongside bumping Garage rhythms. Whether intended or not Boxwork dodges being genre-stamped, fusing a bewildering array of sounds that make it extremely difficult to pigeonhole his sound. In terms of the low end, the track brings to mind Drum &amp; Bass, featuring steroid pumping, sporadic warbling sub hits whilst the mid-range is covered by Techy stabs &amp; cleverly fragmented spoken word samples, reminiscent of footwork styles.</p>
<p>Whilst there is little on the web about Boxwork, the 22 year old London based producer had previously worked as a Hip-Hop producer, before taking influence from the UK Bass scene, and switching up his style. Since working on these new Bass influenced productions, Boxwork has secured a forthcoming EP on ‘<a href="http://lonoteuk.tumblr.com/">Lo Note UK</a>' scheduled for some time after the Summer months. The relatively young label is certainly one to keep an eye on, having released work from the likes of Tessela, Hackman, Wachs Lyrical &amp; Pusherman - we can imagine it really cementing itself over the coming year.</p>
