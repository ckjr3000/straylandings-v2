        <p>For their seventh release, Hypercolour sister label Losing Suki bring us four tracks of smooth, neatly produced house, courtesy of James Welsh. Title track ‘Air Valley’ sets the mood for the rest of the EP, reconfiguring a vocal snatch from The Temptations’ ‘Papa Was a Rolling Stone’ against a background of warm synth tones and handclaps (put to liberal but pleasing use across all four tracks). The rest of the EP largely follows suit, with each track deploying vocal samples, all to gratifying effect.</p>
<p>Third track ‘You’ is certainly the most driven and is best suited to the club, but the whole release seems befitting to both bedroom and dancefloor. With each track clocking in at around six minutes, Welsh gives his ideas time to develop without stagnating, a result many deep house productions stuggle to accomplish. This is evidenced on ‘Nastro Azzuro’, which gently adds layers before shedding them again ninety seconds from the end in an elegant breakdown. A very solid cut from a producer who I’m looking forward to hearing more from in 2012.</p>
<p>Air Valley is set for release on Jan 30th, both as a 12” and digitally; until then you can stream it below.</p>
