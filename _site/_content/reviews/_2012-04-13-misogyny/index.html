            <p>Recently, a track from one of our contributors, Stavrogin, was posted onto youtube, with the picture of a man strangling a woman. Needless to say the uploader was asked to take the track down. Unfortunately this is far from an isolated incident. Several corners of Youtube are rife with videos that contain the following three components: a radio rip of some great track, exposed breasts, and an achingly predictable top comment, usually along the lines of “came for the chick, stayed for the tune”. For what is essentially soft-core pornography to be seen as acceptable for dance music youtube clips, they must be shot a certain way. Often they are made to look superficially ‘arty’ with Instagram photo effects or with the models in ‘Supreme/Obey’ hats, giving them a fashionability similar to that of American Apparel or TopShop. This juxtaposition can make it seem as if the objectified woman is just another necessary commodity for that image, along with the cap and the Instagram effects. Admittedly, a pair of breasts are much less shocking than the Stavrogin example. However, the abundance of naked women that appear in conjunction with dance music these days is undeniably common. Is dance music culture becoming more misogynistic? Sexism is, of course, nothing new for mainstream music - from wartime mascots such as Vera Lynn, to the likes of Girls Aloud and The Pussycat Dolls, there has always been some percentage of objectification of women in music. Even so, I used to think the underground dance music scene in the UK was different. I saw it as a haven for music lovers, which upheld a markedly anti-image tradition. However, I am now beginning to think that it isn’t as sexually sanctified as I once thought.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at some of the heritage that has heavily influenced dance music from the last 20-30 years to try and understand why this phenomenon may have come about. When illegal raves first started to emerge around the country, the media found it difficult to interpret exactly what the message of it all was. Were they rebelling? What was their political standing? Indeed, it seems that rave culture was decidedly apolitical. Respect and tolerance seemed to be the only social policies allowed on the dancefloor - everything else would be left in the daytime along with your suit and your nine to five. Going back further, the German Techno scene has had a huge influence on modern dance music and is still as vibrant as ever. Given that the German Techno scene was largely brought out of underground Gay Clubs, It seems particularly odd that modern clubs should end up so dominated by an ideology that sexualised women. Both the Rave scene in the UK and Gay Scene in Techno circles had one key feature in common - one of sexual equality. Sadly, the dance scene now seems to have an unmistakably <em>sexist</em> outlook, and this is most evidently seen through the youtube pictures and internet blogs. Perhaps the most maddening thing about this recent youtube phenomenon is that often the picture is more talked about than the music, sometimes to the extent that both are even mentioned in the title, as if beats and bums were as inseparable as space &amp; time.</p>
<p><img src="http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k114/georgemc25/Screenshot2012-03-12at112433-2.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>One could argue that since clubbing was initially a predominantly macho activity amongst subcultures of the expanding gay scene, women weren’t really part of dance music society until after the foundations had been laid. Hence, when clubbing entered the mainstream and opened itself up to heterosexual men, it simultaneously opened itself up to women too. However, this still doesn’t explain the sexualisation of women.</p>
<p><img src="http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k114/georgemc25/blawan.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>Granted, the original gay clubbing scene of the 1980s still has remnants of thriving culture - take Berlin’s world-famous Berghain club, where the notoriously strict door policy favours bald heads and tank tops above all else. Despite these glowing reminders of the early Techno scene, most clubs these days favour swathes of scantily clad girls, presumably so that the club photographer can create a portfolio of pretty young things for their website. If you ever find yourself looking through the photos from a club night, it can sometimes feel as if you’re flicking through a lads mag rather than an underground music event - endless streams of women with all the hallmarks of the stereotypical male sexual fantasy. When I recently spoke to a club photographer about his job, he stated that the promoter had instructed him to get as many photos of girls kissing each other as possible. Next time you find yourself on a club-night photo album, note the discrepancy between pictures of men and pictures of women and ask yourself why this might be the case.</p>

<p>If we take a look at the popularity of female DJs and producers, too, we see a bias. Of Resident Advisor’s top 100 DJs of 2011, 8 were female. Doubtless this is because more men start DJing to begin with, but the reasons for that are probably due to something wider. I think many people see DJing as a masculine profession and the existing social climate in which DJing is male-dominated could be intimidating for many women. Taking one of the 8 DJs, Nina Kraviz, we find that her whole image wouldn’t seem out of place in a fashion magazine. Probably her most famous track, ‘I’m Gonna Get You’ is a classic house stomper with whispered vocals throughout that read:</p>
<p>_“my cock is so hot… if you want to ever let me fuck you.. I want to look at you naked with your legs open…” _</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8162/7643819104_cc1dca499a_n.jpg" alt="Nina Kravitz"></p>
<p>I’m not here to tell anyone what he or she can or can’t write in their songs, or the image that they’re allowed or not allowed to have. I don’t want to come across like I’m slating Nina Kraviz here. She is, of course, entitled to be as sexy as she pleases, but I wonder to what extent Kraviz’ music is popular for the sex-appeal and how successful she would be if she took a Burial-style approach; hiding her image completely and letting the music stand for itself. Of course, there are plenty of female producers out there who don’t pander to a sexual image, for instance Margaret Dygas, Ikonika, Steffi… Nevertheless I would also be quick to point out how underrated these producers are. It would be interesting to see the level of attention these producers may get if they adopted a similar sexual persona to Kraviz. I think the respect that Kraviz has could potentially stem from her image – and this doesn’t seem to be so much of a necessary prerequisite for men.</p>
<p>The notion of misogyny and dance music has become a topic of interest lately with Hessle Audio co-founder Ben UFO regularly tweeting about Feminism. I often wonder if perhaps this decade will see a rise in politically concerned DJ-activists. Back in October, UFO tweeted;</p>
<p><img src="http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k114/georgemc25/benufo-1.png" alt="image"></p>

Since then several youtube channels have appeared such as  ‘radioripsvsrapeculture’ and ‘ukhunkylol’. It would seem as if these channels attempt to reverse the ‘sexy women/big beats’ image in the videos to pro-feminist or in some cases, sexy men instead. Of course, saturating the Internet with pictures of naked men is not the answer to combat misogyny. However, when dubstep youtube surfers finally find that one track that they’ve been looking for all year, only to have a picture of a six-pack to accompany it, there is an overwhelming sense of “what is the relevance of that picture?” and it makes you wonder why we don’t ask the same when the image is of a woman.

<p>(Note the ‘MenUFO’)</p>
<p>I think there are two main points of action to take if we want to tackle misogyny in dance music. From the perspective of Stray Landings, I feel it’s our duty to upload as much great new music as possible with a strictly non-misogynist iconography attached. Hopefully this should filter out some of the stuff that you increasingly find on the various <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Etonmessy" target="_blank">Youtube Channels</a> or <a href="http://beatsandfucking.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Music Blogs</a>. Secondly, and most importantly, we need to change people’s minds about dance music. The real problem, I think, is the notion of clubs as nothing more than places to ‘hook up’. As Charlie Brooker put back in 2007;</p>
<p><em>“Seven hours hopping about in a hellish, reverberating bunker in exchange for sharing 64 febrile, panting pelvic thrusts with someone who’ll snore and dribble into your pillow till 11 o’clock in the morning … why not just stay at home punching yourself in the face? It’ll be more fun than a club.” </em></p>
<p>I get the impression that most people today, especially those who have never been to a nightclub, see the veneer of club culture with mostly naked women and dance music and hence associate the two. Club culture is almost ubiquitous now amongst the UK youth - it’s often the centre point of weekends and as such is a big part of our lives. Don’t get me wrong - I think this is wonderful. Clubs are great places to hear music you wouldn’t have otherwise heard, and on a sound system you’re never going to experience anywhere else. I think if we can diminish the amount of sexual imagery that comes along with dance music, particularly on youtube, then we can dissolve the seedy stigma that it seems to have gained. From this, I think it’s possible that we could project a more positive image to the rest of the media, and to the musical community as a whole.</p>
