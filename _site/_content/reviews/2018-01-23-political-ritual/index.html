        <p>Maxime Corbeil-Perron and Félix-Antoine Morin have released an intriguing new 12&quot; with Ambiances Magnétiques: <em>Political Ritual</em>. The record presents two 20-minute pieces that work more like 'sound sculptures' than songs. They take as their subject the detritus of sound, the unwanted buzzes and resonances of technology. On <em>Political Ritual</em>, these sounds move out of the corners and rubbish bins and into plain sight. You are made to confront sound as it really is: caked in surface noise and sonic debris.</p>
<p><em>Political Ritual</em> is a record of two halves. The first, 'Cérémonie', judders like a truck over bumpy terrain. There are moments of what sounds like hyper-engineered studio-production trickery. But in fact, many of these are from acoustic sources, like cellos and organs played in unorthodox styles. There is even the introduction of &quot;a wedding harmonium bought from an old man in an Indian village&quot;.</p>
<p>The unanswered questions left by 'Cérémonie' are concluded by the record's second half: 'Projection Cathodique'. Here, elements of traditional 'musicality' creep in, like the bassline that broods over the piece. The 'politics' of <em>Political Ritual</em> remain somewhat unclear, but its ambiguity is addictive.</p>
