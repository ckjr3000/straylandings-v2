        <p>To the best of my knowledge, ‘C-Mine’ is Tarquin’s first collaboration with Neana (the first to have seen daylight at least), and it’s a partnership that given the solo efforts of each pair, sounds like an egalitarian balance. Tarquin’s bass-led house here interweaves slickly with Neana’s techno impulses, and the fruit of their labour is an (at times) busy and maximal powerhouse of a track. As a Stray Landings contributor and with tracks on both our compilations, Tarquin is a familiar face round these parts, but a little biographical detail is necessary for those as yet unacquainted with the versatile producer currently operating in Guildford. His crisp productions traverse house, garage, and techno; with each track allowing one style to take prominence although never fully discarding the others. He’s enjoyed some success recently with his ever-improving productions (well of course he has, he was on our most recent compilation after all…), with what was his most recent track to emerge on his Soundcloud ‘Hyperglycemia’ – a chunky tech-house number - being played out by names such as French Fries and Maribou State. East London-based Neana is a producer I’m less familiar with; but from following some of his output online he appears to have brought plenty to the collaboration, particularly an ear for sharp percussion.</p>
<p>‘C-Mine’, as with ‘Hyperglycemia’, is unashamedly heavy. Whereas other tracks ostensibly following the same blueprint end up sounding crude and brash, ‘C-Mine’ also has an oddness to it that re-moulds its apparent aggression into a cantankerous oddball stew, reminiscent of releases on Untold’s Hemlock Recordings. An obvious comparison is the similarly foot-stomping work of a producer actually signed to Hemlock, Randomer. It’s a comparison that I hesitate to make as ‘C-Mine’ is more than just pastiche, but it’s an unavoidable one nonetheless - the squelching and thick synths of ‘C-Mine’ are clearly indebted to Randomer’s manic productions.</p>
<p>With that inevitable nod towards Randomer’s influence out the way, there’s plenty more to get to grips with in the track. There’s quite the medley of sounds in ‘C-Mine’, ranging from what sounds like a dialing code to lysergic synth stabs; and thought it could all overwhelming but the sparsely placed kick-drum helps to open up space. The extended intro mutates several times, twice hinting at a drop but both times refraining, leaving you wondering what direction ‘C-Mine’ is going to take. When it does drop, this question isn’t fully resolved, and the track continues to surprise, especially with the unexpected instrumental break three minutes in. ‘C-Mine’ loud, and unescapably so; no matter what volume you listen to it at the airtight production leaps out at you, with each kick demanding your attention and snares juddering about like gunshots.  It may seem a trite thing to say, but as with a lot of dance music it doesn’t quite feel appropriate listening to it on a pair of bedroom monitors. That is not to say it doesn’t suit home listening; rather it has left me tantalized at the prospect of hearing it over a decent system and being physically assailed by it. Given the attention it has received since appearing online, it shouldn’t be a long wait.</p>
