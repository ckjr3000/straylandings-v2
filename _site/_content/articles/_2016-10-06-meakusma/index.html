        <p>The unclassifiable. It’s a key theme that runs through Meakusma, the Belgian label and promoter Meakusma that have long been active in and around Eupen. This year, they decided to step things up a bit, putting on in September their first festival, a three-day event in the local cultural centre hosting a few hundred guests. Their pedigree in the indefinable was clear when the lineup was released. The names I recognised represented a diverse collection of artists, many of whom I’d have trouble categorizing. The rest, at least half of the lineup, remained an alluring mystery that would gradually unfold over the weekend.</p>
<p>Performances were held across three stages of the cultural center on the Friday night. As I’d hoped, artists I was unfamiliar with provided many of the highlights of this night. Tomaga’s Can-like grooves and warbling electronics in Kuhlraum were a perfect start to the Festival, followed up by a theatrical performance by Lord Tang, who, while telling the audience about the building’s previous life as a slaughterhouse, emitted music that there are few words suitable for. In between we caught Izabel Caligiore and Nosedrip selecting proper weirdo dance records that you wouldn’t even know where to start looking for. In Halle, the largest room, Wax Treatment’s Killasan system unfortunately felt like a bad choice for both the room and for the music that night. MM/KM’s set in particular was muffled and lacked life sonically, and some of Ben UFOs selections to close up the night on the system didn’t sound as good as you’d hope.</p>
<p>The next day however, these problems were quickly remedied, when the system moved outside for Wax Treatment’s own open-air showcase. Here, the system came into its own without the bare walls of Halle and in the capable hands of Mark Ernestus, Fiedel, Roger Robinson and friends, who throughout the day were selecting reggae, dub, dancehall, dubstep and everything in between. This sunny afternoon spent beside the community garden listening to all things dub was one of the highlights of the festival, and I can’t recommend enough that anyone with a chance to attend Wax Treatment does so at the next opportunity. The Saturday afternoon also saw an additional building, Heuboden, open up for a Dublab showcase. Here we caught ML playing a range of obscurities, and Kassem Mosse &amp; Mix Mup doing a second live show as Chilling The Do, which was relieved of the sound issues of the previous day and was all the more enjoyable for it. Later on, back in Halle, was an intense performance from Babyfather, where Dean Blunt’s absence was more than made up for by James Massiah. With a theme of police violence and racism in London, this was particularly hard-hitting, but it was great to see this kind of set, focusing on a local experience of a global epidemic, in a foreign context.</p>
<p>With the Dublab showcase going straight through the night, Saturday slowly blurred into Sunday, where Heuboden continued to platform an eclectic range of DJs and musicians until early Monday morning. Elsewhere on this final day, the varied programming was maintained, with highlights coming from Yves De Mey and an performance of Terry Riley’s In C by the Christian Klinkenberg Orchestra. We ended the festival with Call of the Deer, something I assumed was a lecture or installation, but turned out to be the most unique piece of curation I experience over the weekend. Call of the Deer involved a short minibus trip to the local forest, where we were led for about 20 minutes in the pitch dark in the hope of hearing the seasonal deer mating sounds. Unfortunately, we didn’t hear all that much – in fact, the closest we got to a deer was seeing one in the road on the journey back – but this was still a strangely exciting experience that, while unexpected, feels in retrospect perfectly at home within Meakusma’s celebration of the unclassifiable.</p>
<p>Meakusma’s programming was, for me, infallible, but it’s not the only thing that was on point. Eupen was an unexpectedly beautiful setting, and the recently renovated cultural centre was a perfect space for the multi-stage festival. In addition, there’s a clear emphasis on affordability. A weekend ticket costs just 60€, and includes camping in the garden for those so inclined. The fact that this was the first edition of the festival is all the more impressive, and is a testament to the experience of the team behind it. Personally, I think I’ll be returning to Meakusma year after year, and I’m excited to see how the festival develops in the future. Any music fan with a taste they struggle to define, I reckon will have a hard time finding a more suitable festival than Meakusma.</p>
