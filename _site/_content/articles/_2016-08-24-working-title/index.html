            <p>This month, the latest series of the BBC Three adopted <em>People Just Do Nothing</em> began broadcasting. Its origins lie in mimicking a BBC documentary made about Southend pirate radio, 'Tower Block Dreams'. The original programme followed the exploits of 'Killer' - a self-professed _ running local station Y2K. Amongst the ideas explored in the original documentary were serious issues related to drugs and crime, as well as the vilifying of young black men by local police forces. Unsurprisingly given the theme, the series has gained a lot of attention in the dance/electronic music world - publications like Vice, _ &amp; _ keen to jump on the bandwagon.</p>
<p>Matt Lucas and David Walliam's rightly received derision for their crude and offensive concoction of class stereotypes (Vicky Pollard perhaps most infamously). Similarly characters like Catherine Tate's Lauren Cooper ('Am I Bovvered') and a string of patronising reality show's with an obsession with 'benefits scoungers', gypsies and _ received criticism for their crass and bigoted representation of these communities.</p>
<p>For a while it felt like this had finally and long-overdue gone out of fashion, yet PJDN's enthusiastic use of class stereotypes seems to show the public are still laughing. This season for example sees 'MC Grindah's partner 'Lady Miche' plan her dream wedding. In a broad Essex accent her and her mum loudly walk through stately homes asking if 'more pillars can be added' - the ultimate butt of the joke being their stupidity and the fact they can't afford it. After downsizing to a local buffet style bar, _</p>
<p>Similarly, there are characters like 'Steves' - a habitual drug user who takes what he can whenever he can. Again Steves is another character who's intellectual limitations are a strong focus and source of amusement. He is given odd jobs which he botches in most cases; attempting to steel lights from a hardware store or _. One episode he is sent to the Job Centre by the crew to claim benefits to fund one of their exploits and it is this instance which maybe best sums up what I feel could be problematic about PJDN.</p>
