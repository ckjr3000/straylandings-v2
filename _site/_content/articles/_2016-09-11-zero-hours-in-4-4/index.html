            <p>A few years ago, Rolling Stone magazine came under fire after the announcement that founder Jann Wenner's 22 year old son would be taking the reins of rollingstone.com despite having worked for the website for just six months previously. Unsurprisingly, this was widely seen for what it was, a blatant case of nepotism and family favouritism. [is this related to 0-hours?] In the Guardian this week, Deborah Orr bravely defended zero-hours contracts, claiming that &quot;job security can be a kind of burden, a brake on the nurturing of hopes and the following of dreams.&quot; Anyone who has worked a zero-hours contract within the arts knows that the complete opposite is true.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is because of their powerful history of social liberalism, electronic music circles are often thought of as inherently left leaning. They have played hugely important roles in the empowerment of minority groups in years gone by. This ranges from the advent of disco alongside the fight for sexual freedoms by the LGBT community in the '70s and '80s, to Underground Resistance movement and empowerment of black monitories in the U.S. These days electronic scenes continue to prolong this heritage. Look at the way in which producers rally around free releases to support a multitude of causes, from raising awareness of the homophobic policies of contemporary Russia, through to humanitarian aid projects in the third world. [target examples].</p>
<p>Given this, it seems a strange outlier that music journalism tends to favour seems to cultivate such a cliquey, elitist atmosphere in terms of its employment practises. Unpaid internships and highly insecure work contracts are often seen as the hallmarks of the ultra-right, as we have seen recently with the proliferation of zero-hours contracts under a conservative government, a recent article in The Independent revealing the number of  people on zero-hours contracts has leapt 20 percent in the past year.</p>
<p>In our own experiences of music journalism, we have all had to work for free in some capacity, either during internships or freelancing with the aim of being able to cite some of the bigger names on our CVs. For a long time I had a sense that 'once I reach this or that level of publication, I will be paid for my work'. Whether by my own shortcomings or not however, I can honestly say I've never reached that point, despite spending the last five years spending quite a large amount of my time writing. Where we have been paid for our work, the time/labour division often works out at significantly sub minimum wage levels - often around Â£5 an hour. What's more, it can take months to receive.</p>
<p>This said, it'd be wrong not to acknowledge cases which see the boundaries blurred. We never solicit unpaid work on Stray Landings, yet we do generously accept it when offered. Similarly it's unreasonable for other small labels, magazines or similar pursuits to be cutting out cheques when they are not turning profit themselves. What is important, is that these enterprises are clear, upfront and vocal about their income.</p>
