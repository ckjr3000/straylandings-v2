        <p>&quot;It was always going to end in tears, whose tears? Probably my own. Ten years of mouldy old dough has left me in this position where I can no longer move. Trapped by debt accumulated over that time as a result of running a no win label. There has never been a plan afoot at V/Vm it's all been about instincts from day one. V/Vm 365 will be the last project I undertake. As it's time to move on once this recycled audio slab is finally completed.&quot;</p>
<p>Our In Focus series usually take the form of explorations of labels currently in operation. For this one however, I wanted to look back at V/vm Test Records, a label which ended its life in 2008. V/Vm Test Records was originally founded by Leyland Kirby and Andy McGregor in 1996, and give the liner notes quoted above, it would be tempting to say the project became increasingly erratic as it went on. Looking back at a release like 'Shoplift' however, this might be difficult to argue. The sixth release in the V/Vm Test Records catalogue, 'Shoplift' saw Leyland Kirby scratch, break and tape different 12&quot;s before placing them in record stores inside zip-locked bags, with a sheet instructing the reader to steal the release.</p>
<p>(V)olume (V)ersus (M)ass Test Records</p>
<p>V/vm painted a landscape which once seen, makes everything else seem boring in comparison. Like a _ piece in a gallery full of _. It is label that asks us to stop and question what we are doing, whether the economy of digital music is sustainable</p>
