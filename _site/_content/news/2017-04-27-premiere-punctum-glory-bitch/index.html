        <p>Early last year, Punctum finished recording their debut record, <em>Remote Sensing</em>, at the legendary EMS studio in Stockholm. After nearly a year and a half, the album is finally ready for public consumption. I have an oddly personal relationship to an album that is not yet released. I first got a taste of their work in <a href="http://www.straylandings.co.uk/podcasts/0062">a mix from Maria W Horn</a>, which featured the heavy and hypnotic 'Quick Botta'. This became a major go-to headphone listen. Strongly recommended for long journeys in the dark.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, a lot of the music on this record quite simple to describe. 303s, 606s and Buchlas dance around each other like an harmonic kaleidoscope. But listen to 'Glory Bitch' below. There's a lot more going on here than simple synth meanderings, the likes of which every bedroom producer knows all too well.  There is a meticulous care that has been taken in its entrance and exit. It's like a set of opening credits, or a tuning orchestra, setting the stage for something huge, before snaking away into the distance. Fitting then, this should be the opening for one of the most exciting records in recent memory.</p>
<p><em>'Remote Sensing' is out now on Summe. Purchase <a href="https://hardwax.com/08880/punctum/remote-sensing/">here</a>.</em></p>
