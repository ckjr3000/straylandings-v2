        <p>An intriguing new compilation has been announced, taking the natural resonances of custom-built stones to create music. The stones, which don't look dissimilar to the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/arrival-production-designer-reveals-how-create-an-new-type-flying-saucer-945155"><em>Arrival</em> spaceships</a>, are at once objects of primordiality and futurism. The idea of making music from stones is so pre-historic that it is almost unsettling. This is a depiction of music at its origins: centuries before instrument crafting, millennia before recorded sound. Yet the stones used on this album have been cut with laser precision within a hair's breadth margin, to optimise the acoustic resonances of the object. Consequently, the sounds are strangely exotic, bursting with a riveting modernity.</p>
<p>This sense of modernity is bolstered by the artists featured on the record, all of whom operate at the cutting edge of contemporary music. The album comes bundled with a sound stone sample pack containing audio samples of the Halliday/Fessmann sound stone, as used on this album by the other artists. The album consists of nine experimental interpretations by a star-studded line up, featuring Jasmine Guffond, Paul Jebanasam, Afonso Ferreira, Tomonari Nozaki, James Leyland Kirby, Steven M Halliday, Monty Adkins, Yves De Mey and Rutger Zuydervelt.</p>
<p><em>Sound and Stone</em> forms the final phase of Steven M Halliday's two-year research project into the Fessmann sound stones at the University of Huddersfield. You can hear the full <em>Sound and Stone</em> project on 26th October with Composer Built. Below, stream the mind-bending contribution from Yves de Mey as an exclusive for Stray Landings. You can also head over to <a href="https://composerbuilt.bandcamp.com/releases">the Composer Built Bandcamp</a> to listen to other excerpts from Machinefabriek and Jasmine Guffond.</p>
