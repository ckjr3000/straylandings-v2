<p><em>Nev Lilit</em></p>
<p>The newly formed Moloton imprint recently announced their debut vinyl batch, scheduled for release later this month. The label have a growing catalogue of warbled-cassette ambience, which piqued our interest in March with the release of Atonet's eery <em><a href="http://straylandings.co.uk/reviews/ido-atonet">Ido</a></em>.</p>
<p>This month will see two parallel releases: <em>Vilar i dina sp책r</em> from Sonja Tofik &amp; Marlena Lampinen and <em>Adorable Ruin</em> from Nev Lilit. The former is a repress of material previously released on cassette, but as Moloton explain, popularity for this album encouraged them to remaster and repress the material to 200 vinyls.</p>
<p><em>Vilar i dina sp책r</em> compounds a style that Moloton have already begun exploring, turning electronic synthesis into something more tactile and material. Just listen to the warm enclosure of 'I din famn, 채ntligen fri' (meaning 'In your arms, at last, free') below. <em>Adorable Ruin</em> by contrast is more distant, presenting two free-form soundscapes that are dank, cold and cavernous.</p>
<p><em>Vilar i dina sp책r</em> and <em>Adorable Ruin</em> will be released together on May 25th with Moloton, pre-order <a href="https://www.moloton.com/">here</a>.</p>
