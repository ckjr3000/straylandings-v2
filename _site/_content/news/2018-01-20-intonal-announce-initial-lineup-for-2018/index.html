<p>Our love for all things Swedish was stressed with much vigour in our <a href="http://straylandings.co.uk/articles/the-stray-landings-christmas-pudding">concluding article to 2017</a>. From abiding establishments like EMS which see artists visit from all over the world, to the more recent D.I.Y style collectives like Drömfakulteten or DJ Mayhem, it's a region which feels particularly abundant in electronic music of all styles at the moment.</p>
<p>Not that we need any further convincing, but Malmö-based experimental music festival Intonal, recently announced their initial lineup for this year's event, and it looks rather special by any account. Run by the figures behind Malmö arts venue Inkonst and artistic research platform Inter Arts Center, Intonal is now entering its fourth year, taking place between the 25-30 April. They have already confirmed New York minimalist pioneer Charlemagne Palestine and Japanese new wave and industrial duo Group A as part of the bill, as well as drawing in some phenomenal acts from across the Nordic region.</p>
<p>Alongside Stray Landings favourite Ellen Arkbro, Andreas Tilliander will be performing under his tripped-out dub alias Mokira, and acid-contortionist and Rephlex signee Aleksi Perälä travelling from Finland to join the bill. Charlotte Bendiks of Norway's 'techno capital', Tromsø, is also set to perform, bringing her own misfit take on the genre.</p>
