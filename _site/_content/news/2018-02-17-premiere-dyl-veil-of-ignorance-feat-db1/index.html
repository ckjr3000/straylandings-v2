        <p>I'm unsure how best to describe the Re:st or the 'Relation Reset' label as it's otherwise known. On the one hand, nearly all of its offerings occupy 160+ BPM tempos, yet to term it as a drum and bass label in the classic sense would probably leave a lot of jump-up heads disappointed. Re:st operate at the very periphery of the genre, dabbling in everything from skittish percussive experiments to low-gravity ambience.</p>
<p>The same assessment can rightly be applied to their latest signee - Romanian artist Eduard Costea aka Dyl. His 'Hybridisation' EP, due for release on Re:st in the next few weeks has as much in common with noise cassette labels like Hobo Cult as it does the legacy of D&amp;B. The opener, 'Anthropomorphism' for example is packed with the kind of joyous electroacoustic oddities you might find in a Frank Oppenheimer thriller, twitching its way through factory hits and crumbling distortions.</p>
<p>Included in the EP is a collaboration with Hidden Hawaii mainstay Dylan Brownsword aka DB1, entitled 'Veil of Ignorance'. The track is the most identifiable of the lot in terms of being a D&amp;B track, yet it still enjoys its own quirks along the way. Among the toughened percussive excursions there are warbling oscillations and what sounds like a singing bowl being played down a phone line...</p>
<p>To celebrate the EP's upcoming release, Re:st kindly offered us an exclusive stream of the track, accessible below:</p>
