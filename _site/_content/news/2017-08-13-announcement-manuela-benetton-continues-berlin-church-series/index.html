<p>Event curator Manuela Benetton recently announced the next three instalments of her series of gigs hosted in Berlin churches.</p>
<p>Previous events have showcased and encouraged novel collaborations. In May for example, Canadian glitch artist and internet terror Jesse Osborne-Lanthier displayed a one off collaborations with Haunter Records founder Daniele Guerrini, while supporting avante-noise trio Merzbow, Keiji Haino and Balázs Pándi.</p>
<p>On September 16, Mitte's St. Elisabethkirche will host a new collaboration, this time from Pan Daijing, Valerio Tricoli and Werner Dafeldecker entitled 'The Speaker'. The collaboration is billed as a piece of 'aural theatre' using both dialogue and live electronics to explore themes of &quot;solipsism, paranoia and identity&quot;. The event is well timed, Daijing having recently released her hair-raising debut-album, <em>Lack</em>, on Bill Kouligas' PAN imprint, aligning crushing electronics, disturbed cinematic timbres and crawling sound-design.</p>
<p>There will also be a supporting performance from acousmatic composer, Beatriz Ferreyra. Her debut record was in the late-1970s, with a number of lengthy hiatus' in terms of recorded works. In recent years however she has put out a number of LPs, including the alien phase experiments of <em>GRM Works</em>, released through Editions Mego.</p>
