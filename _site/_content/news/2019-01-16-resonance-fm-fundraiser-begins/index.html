<p>The Resonance FM annual fundraiser is about to begin. We are immensely thankful for the opportunity to platform artists and friends on FM radio, and an extra big ups goes to George Rayner-Law who volunteers to engineer our shows. If you enjoy our Stray Landings FM show and have the means, please <a href="https://www.facebook.com/donate/829979297342086/2017871538288648/">consider donating</a>. We wouldn't be able to do it without them.</p>
