<p>Our debut 12&quot; comes from Japanese sound-artist Yu Miyashita/Yaporigami. We first became aware of his work two years back, upon the release of his stunning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdigk5DMYkI">Sync/Body</a> collaboration with visual collective <a href="http://brdg.tokyo/">BRDG</a>. His blend of atmosphere rich sound-design and fragmented techno felt distinct and refreshing. After contacting Miyashita and arranging a <a href="http://www.straylandings.co.uk/post/60644614647/0021-yu-miyashita-yaporigami">mix/interview feature</a>, we quickly realised that his work was some of the most unique music we had heard in some time, and decided it needed to be exposed to a wider audience.</p>
<p>This EP, 'Grind Analysts Fig.1' sees the union of Miyashita's two projects; the a-side being occupied by the relatively dance-floor centric tracks he crafts as Yaporigami, whereas the b-side is reserved for the haunting atmospheric soundscapes he composes under his birth-name.</p>
<p>Included with the 12&quot; we have also put together an accompanying booklet, seeking to reveal some of the processes we went through when making the record. It features an interview with Miyashita, as well several labels and artistic collectives (including BRDG) with which he has worked closely over the last few years.</p>
<p>'Grind Analysts Fig.1' will be available as part of a limited 100 copy vinyl run from early April, and digitally shortly after.</p>
