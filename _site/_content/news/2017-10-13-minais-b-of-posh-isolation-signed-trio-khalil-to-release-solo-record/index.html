<p>Earlier this year, Posh Isolation released <em>The Water We Drink</em>, the debut record from Danish trio, Khalil. The trio caused a splash earlier in the year for their effective fusion of Nikolaj Vonsild's auto-tuned vocals and experimental sound collage, particularly on the album's lead single, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/poshisolation/rest-my-head-against-a-wall-of-water">'Rest My Head Against A Wall of Water'</a>. Like much music in the world of Posh Isolation and co, releases have a staggering turn around. Just two months since <em>The Water We Drink</em>, nascent imprint Petrola 80 have announced an EP from one of Khalil's less known members, Villads Klint.</p>
<p>Under the moniker 'Minais B', Villads Klint has written a free-form experiment in time-warped samples and sci-fi synthesisers. The piece reels around like an LED advertising billboard, with a dazzling display of special effects and studio trickery. Over the top, an instructional voice repeats a cryptic mantra. The voice, like some kind of benevolent self-service machine who has become a bit too friendly, talks to me of pursed lips, moist tongues and bubbles of saliva. I don't know if I'm being sold something, or warned of impending danger. Either way, I'm listening.</p>
<p><em>As The River At Its Source</em> will be out as a 12&quot; vinyl and digital download from October 21st, 2017 on Petrola 80.</p>
