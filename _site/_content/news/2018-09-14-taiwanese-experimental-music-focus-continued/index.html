<p>Lacking Sound Festival is one of the most prestigious events for experimental sound artists in Taiwan.

It has been running continuously in Taiwan for the past 8 years. Lacking Sound Festival does not only introduce international new talents, but also dedicates themselves to documenting and producing theory writing on the Taiwanese sound art scene. In collaborating with Chung, this will be the very first time that Lacking Sound Festival presenting its associated artists in Europe.</p>
