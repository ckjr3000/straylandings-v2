        <p>The Berlin &amp; Bristol-based label, Subtext, are due to showcase their roster at the new Säule room next month. Over the past 12 months, Subtext have presented an impressive flurry of full-length releases. We saw Ellen Arkbro's bold and courageous composition, <a href="http://www.straylandings.co.uk/reviews/for-organ-and-brass-ellen-arkbro"><em>For Organ &amp; Brass</em></a>, which will no doubt be topping many of those end-of-year lists in December. We also had FIS &amp; Rob Thorne with <a href="http://www.straylandings.co.uk/reviews/clear-stones-fis-rob-thorne"><em>Clear Stones</em></a>, a record that was criminally overlooked at the time of release, but to my mind remains FIS' most original work. Then, a new album from <a href="http://www.straylandings.co.uk/podcasts/0076-cevdet-erek">Cevdet Erek</a>, which explored a novel technique to play and record a traditional Turkish drum. And this month we had <em>Compound</em>, the unsettling new LP from jazz-experimentalist, <a href="http://www.straylandings.co.uk/interviews/reverse-engineering-yair-elazar-glotman-interview">Yair Elazar Glotman</a>. For me, these four records cement Subtext as one of, if not the most interesting record label of 2017 so far.</p>
<p>Their showcase presents all the artists mentioned above, as well as sets from Roly Porter and Emptyset. This will be at Berghain's exciting new 'Säule' venue, a room dedicated to platforming the more esoteric side of electronic music. Expect noise, drone, glitch and more besides. The opening of this venue was a good move. Berghain was getting dangerously close to being historically pigeon-holed as a techno venue and nothing more. But at last, Berghain has decided to awaken from its dogmatic slumbers and catch up with the present.</p>
<p>The Subtext showcase will be held on 9th November, 2017. Find out more <a href="http://www.berghain.de/event/2175">here</a>.</p>
