<p>Every year, CTM take on a conceptual theme: something to tie together its myriad events and performances, from the DJ sets to the lectures and installations. This year's concept is 'Turmoil' with its associating tagline, 'Uneasy times demand uneasy music'. The 9-day festival hopes to explore themes of alienation in an accelerated world and possibilities of redemption through art and community.</p>
