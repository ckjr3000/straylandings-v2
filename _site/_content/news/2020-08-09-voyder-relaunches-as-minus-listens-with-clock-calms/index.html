<p>Assessing the work of noise label Voyder in 2017, we commented: “[Voyder] only like waveforms which look like a city broker’s payday cigar. Any breaks or dynamics are compressed to oblivion, resulting in tracks which are above all else, loud.”</p>
<p>The same cannot be said of the collective’s recent re-sculpting under the guise ‘Minus Listens’. The debut release for the newly revamped label came out late last month – a delicate, palliative listen, awash with vaporous atmospherics and carefully constructed sound design.</p>
<p>Entitled ‘Clocks Calms’, the LP is written by Brighton-based David Richards, aka Brunstein. Taking influence from Ursula Le Guin and oceanic fantasies, ‘Clocks Calms’ navigates through 45 minutes of disconcerting ambience, crafting a compelling and immersive narrative.
