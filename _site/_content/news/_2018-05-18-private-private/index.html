<p>The newly formed Lowlife Cartel imprint have returned with another compilation, this time featuring an impressive roster including Buttechno, Fmy, Sammy T Thompson, Machine Woman, PRESENTE and Voyd. In an exclusive for Stray Landings, we can share a stream of Machine Woman's 'Mr Hodge Appreciation Society'.</p>
<p>This latest release will mark the next in a series of impressive, nearly flawless, 12&quot;s from Machine Woman, from <em>For Sweden</em> in 2016 to <em>When Lobster Comes Home</em> last year. 'Mr Hodge Appreciation Society' is a step into more extreme territory, with a heart-racing tempo and piercing dial-up tones that jump out at jaunty angles. There's even a donk.</p>
<p><em>'Dragged Shed Impressions' will be out on June 18th, pre-order a 12&quot; <a href="https://lowlifecartel.bandcamp.com/album/dragged-shed-impressions">here</a>, limited to 200 copies.</em></p>
