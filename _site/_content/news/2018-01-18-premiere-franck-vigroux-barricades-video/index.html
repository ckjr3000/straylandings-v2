        <p>I first came across Franck Vigroux through his 2015 collaboration with Mika Vainio for Cosmo Rhythmatic, <em>Peau froide, léger soleil</em>. The album came after a series of live shows the pair had embarked on together, creating an unsettling balance between the natural and the synthetic.</p>
<p>Since then, Vigroux has been slowly stripping his studio to the extent that he can now fit all his equipment in one suitcase. This simplification of his setup coincided with the release of <em>Barricades</em> late last year, an album referencing Vigroux's belief that we are increasingly retreating into the comforts of technology, rather than pursuing organic interactions. The LP is an assertive and visceral offering, as if attempting to wake the listener from their technology induced stupor and get out in the fresh air.</p>
<p>If you’d rather stay in a darkened room in front of your laptop with a cup of Horlicks however, Vigroux has offered us a premiere of the video which accompanies the title track, created by Kurt d'Haeseleer:</p>
