    "content": "<p>New York based producers Andrew Siedenburg &amp; Alberto Hernandez make up downtempo electronica outfit ‘Background Sound’. The duo, who formed earlier this year, focus themselves on deep Mount Kimbie-esque synth driven garage. They have recently been causing a significant stir, leading to a Rinse FM spot courtesy of DJ extraordinaire ‘Oneman’.</p>\n<p>In April they brought us this hypnotic rolling garage refix of the Falty DL tune ‘Brazil’, for the Falty DL remix competition. The remix maintains a wonderfully strong sense of rhythm and groove, whilst remaining tastefully sparse and minimal via twitching drum sounds; helped along by airy throbbing synths. Perhaps the extra rhythmic punch comes from ‘Background Sound’s’ heavily mallet-ed instrumentation, driving the piece forward rhythmically and adding texture to those beautifully reworked steel drums.</p>\n<p>Background Sound manage to bring a sombre, melancholic edge to the Falty DL original, turning Lily Mackenzie’s soulful vocals into haunting aural slices eased in and out of the mix.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F12033155&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Producing on Ableton, Akzidenz is set to have his first official release on ‘Courtship Records’ later on this year.</p>\n<p>The initial slow rolling build-up of ‘Cinema’ deceptively eases you into the slow panning breathy atmospheric chimes, and gentle percussion. The sounds used have a distinctly organic feel, perhaps emphasized by the gently side chained oceanic background sample that runs throughout, subliminally pushing forward the natural groove of the track.</p>\n<p>One of the most surprising things about this tune I find is its ability to maintain its composure and elegance, through the frankly fierce surging drop halfway through the piece. If this wasn’t intense enough ‘Akzidenz’ also manages to pull of a graceful switch up in the final minute of ‘Cinema’ which is undoubtedly one of his strong points listening over his other tracks, and one of the hardest things for any producer to pull off well.</p>\n<p><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F10366177\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></object></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/akzidenz/cinema\">Cinema</a> by <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/akzidenz\">Akzidenz</a></p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Southampton-based Greg Edward’s spacious new track successfully marries classic house ambience with 2-step grooves. The warm synth-stabs that ground ‘Feels Like’ at a moody distance throughout, giving room for a littering of light vocal-samples that orbit the chords comfortably. The vocals wouldn’t sound out of place on a Joy Orbison track - airy, soulful and tastefully sparse.</p>\n<p>The garage-bass, however, is a pleasant surprise, and bounces off a frisky off-kilt beat comprised of crisp hi-hats and a punchy snare that keeps you on your toes. This gives the track its fresh feel and distinction.</p>\n<p>Indeed, much of what is great about this track can be found in the production, which is surely Edward’s strong point. Anima has either given a garage tune some intensity or given a house tune some complexity, but either way he has the technical toolbox to do both.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F15072317&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>This is the first track that London-based artist ‘Desimal’ (Mike Harvey) has put up for display in some time following his self-released ‘Tycho EP’ earlier in the year, hopefully in the effort to create a cohesive second release before putting his work on display.</p>\n<p>It’s clear that Anomalize marks a certain consolidation of several different strands of his sound. It retains the intricately scattered, DnB-tinged clicks alongside his tasteful vocal chopping. But what sets this track aside from his previous work is the greater coherency that the thoughtfully programmed beat and soulful sample bring to the table. On top of this Anomalize shows off some well placed and restrained bass weight, and restrained is really what Desimal does best here; the Aretha Franklin vocal feels constantly on the brink of expansion while Harvey deftly cuts it back.<br>\n <br>\nAnomalize may in many ways be one of Desimal’s greatest assets. He has put together a satisfying and propulsive bit of bass music that leaves little to be asked for. It manages to retain a degree of elegance and class through the track’s restraint, something rarely found in this genre.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F15714863&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Steering towards the most recent straint of the dubstep sound Bath based producer Ed Russel (Tessela) brings us two thundering tunes that really wouldn’t sound out of place on a Hessle audio release. Despite a previous background in production, Ed has only been producing under the ‘Tessela’ monika for the past year and has managed to develop the name in a very short space of time, providing mixes for various websites as well as DJing in nearby (and speculative current home of dubstep) Bristol. The two tracks tastefully combine classic techno and garage influences and will be available via Dublin based label ‘All City Records’ on the 23/05/2011.</p>\n<p>'Slugger' eases in with some jazzy dimlite-esque  sample manipulation before lurching into swaying tech-garage rhythms. Maintaining snatches of the original samples Tessela manages to keep our musical interest throughout the track whilst keeping the tune very much within dancefloor vibe. Although a still developing sound in the dubstep world ‘Slugger’ could be compared to the works of artists such as Blawan or Objekt.</p>\n<p>'Subway' presents a more traditional dubstep sound via its rolling drum work, although once again Tessela's musicianship and excellent sample manipulation stand this track apart from the typical sub-rolling dubstep. Tessela also harnesses some wonderfully manipulated vocal samples reminiscent of some of Jamie XX's work although in a completely different context. Halfway through the track Tessela flips the tune, shifting to old school synth stabs that recall the sound of early 90s Jungle.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F17502718&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Judging from his Soundcloud, it would seem that London-based Sam Walker (AKA Palace) perhaps feels more comfortable doing remixes than his own tunes. But don’t be fooled - the new track released by Palace last monday is of its own kind.</p>\n<p>The opening dry clicks and claps almost sound like the start of James Blake’s ‘Maybes’ remix, which perhaps shouldn’t be too surprising as Walker’s remix of “I’ll stay”, his most popular tune so far, can boast over 7000 plays. However, instead of sinking into the murky realms of dark dubstep, Palace keeps it bright and frisky with a warbling set of wonky jazz chords. Arguably, much of what makes this track unique is how the dreaded middle-frequencies have been occupied. Palace could have easily slapped on shit-loads of reverb to fill space and left it at that, but by leaving the glowing synth-pad dry and centralised, he manages to keep a succinct and yet ethereal sound.</p>\n<p>The otherworldly textures come fully into fruition at the drop, however. A trembling resonance sedates the beat into a watery uncertainty but is quickly and masterfully snapped back awake with vocal fragments and a lively bassline that weaves all over the track. No matter which part you look at, Down With You has been very nicely put together, with a tasteful swinging between rhythmic tension and harmonic detachment.</p>\n<p><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F18851814\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></object></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/palacepalace/down-with-you\">Palace - Down With You</a> by <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/palacepalace\">PALACE</a></p>\n",

    "content": "<p>With a name to cause even the most unpronounceable witch house musician to turn green with envy, you could be forgiven for expecting Greek producer Δ Δ, also known as Dmitri, to be churning out trendy, of the moment beats that will sound stale in a couple of years’ time. This would be a mistake however, and with figures such as Mary Anne Hobbs (via her show on XFM) and Rob Booth (via his legendary Electronic Explorations podcast) promoting Dmitri’s sound, it’s clear that although his production sounds very much of its era, it does so in the best possible sense – it draws on a plethora of past influences (see his Nothing Days mix available on soundcloud) and yet feels vitally modern, at the forefront of the diverse strands of electronic music it encompasses.</p>\n<p>The 808-driven ‘Sportex’ takes lead from the footwork influenced releases by Addison Groove, Ramadanman et al, but clocking in at around 130bpm, and with a chopped Bone Thugs vocal sample, resembles more a pulsing fusion of earlier ghetto house and fragments of dubstep. The classic acid synth line which enters the fray at the four minute mark justifies the track’s length, and widens the sonic palette to give it greater depth by being well juxtaposed with the aforementioned vocal element. The track itself is over nine months old, and a glance at Dmitri’s soundcloud page indicates that it occupies just a corner of his musical domain, with more recent tempo-spanning tracks incorporating components from ambient, electro, instrumental hip hop and dubstep. With a release on US label Pushing Red forthcoming (including a remix by Ikonika), expect to be hearing a lot more from Dmitri, or if you insist**, **Δ Δ, over the final months of 2011.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F16576247&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe> ",

    "content": "<p>Writing a review of a festival from an objective perspective can pose quite a challenge, not least because each musical encounter is so heavily imbued with personal and external events (and often experienced through a lens of intoxication); but also due to the sheer impossibility of taking everything in and seeing and doing everything that’s on offer. To write purely about the music from a detached viewpoint and nothing else would be a disservice to All Tomorrow’s Parties, and I must acknowledge that the music is only one of the things that makes the weekend at Butlins so thoroughly entertaining. Chalet parties, the excellent waterpark, amusement arcades, the beach and the peculiar sight of watching Ariel Pink and others wandering around a kitsch British seaside resort all set the ATP experience apart from most festivals (honourable mentions to Bloc, Bangface etc.), and the intimate atmosphere is something I’ve yet to find replicated elsewhere.</p>\n<p>The Butlins resort did seem slightly emptier than usual, and there were rumours that as much as a third of the tickets remained unsold. However, the line-up was one of the festival’s strongest; and there was no shortage of musical clashes, not to mention the intriguing cinema programme, which included oddball Japanese horror; some excellent documentaries from the Sublime Frequencies label, who also had several artists performing live; and a fascinating and hypnotic four hour ‘History of Sound Art’ installation.</p>\n<p>Second on the main stage on Friday were <strong>Black Dice</strong>, who seemed intent on exploiting all possible frequencies in a frankly ear crushing set. The volume on the centre stage seemed quite inconsistent across the three days, and while the penetrating squelch of the Brooklyn collective’s low end was a welcome getting ‘thrown in at the deep end’ start to the festival, ear plugs were definitely requisite. It was a much more beat orientated set than their previous work might have suggested, presenting the audience with a skewed take on dance music, yet still very much in keeping with the group’s tendency to stray from traditional musical structures.</p>\n<p>Next up was <strong>Lee Scratch Perry</strong>, who arrived twenty minutes late, looking like a cross between Flavor Flav and Sun Ra and performing with a lot more verve than most in their seventies could manage. Unfortunately, the performance was somewhat disappointing, with the little of his set that I saw being prosaic and far removed from the music which earned him the reverence he is accorded today.</p>\n<p>One of the weekend’s highlights was Werk Disc’s label head **Actress, **who played a 75 minute live set on the second stage on Friday night. He worked new beats in with previously released tracks, closing with a resounding version of ‘Maze’, the highlight of last year’s ‘Splazsh’ full length, and his set was supremely paced throughout. The only criticism that could be levelled was that the volume in the room was slightly quiet, although after the clamorous cacophony Black Dice conjured earlier in the evening this didn’t prove to be a cause of much dissidence. Closing the centre stage was recondite minimalist hero <strong>Terry Riley</strong>, playing keyboard with accompaniment from his son Gyan Riley on classical guitar. It was a relaxing end to the evening’s programme; yet it never veered towards dreariness and was satisfying to watch a composer still producing and performing interesting music at the age of seventy-five.</p>\n<p>Saturday began with the Wet Sounds installation in the swimming pool, which was unfortunately hampered by its popularity – the amalgamation of the general din of the swimming pool and the chatter of the punters made for a difficult listening experience, although arguably the ambient noise could be construed as part of the experience. Above the water a steady drone played out, and beneath the surface there was an mishmash of meandering elevator music and found sounds; although others reported that on the Sunday performance music from Animal Collective member Noah Lennox’s recent LP ‘Tomboy’ was played, with different channels emerging from the speakers above and in the water.</p>\n<p>**Vladislav Delay’s **set on late Saturday afternoon was similarly well paced to Actress the night before, and despite a few dull moments it was an enjoyable and interesting hour of manipulated loops chugging away, periods of relentless stabs of low end, and an idiosyncratic use of danceable distortion. He was followed by <strong>Meat Puppets</strong>, playing their 1985 album ‘Up on the Sun’. For those familiar with the album it was doubtless an impressive show, but it came across as a little mediocre, despite being played with admirable enthusiasm; although the prolonged jam at the end was a welcome, and admittedly entertaining treat.</p>\n<p><strong>Ariel Pink</strong>’s well-crafted pop songs lit up the centre stage next on Saturday night, and the crowd he drew reflected the wider audience he has found in the past year – eighteen months ago he played the on smallest stage at ATP. An idiosyncrasy of Ariel Pink is that tracks from his initial self-released and recorded albums sound far cleaner and polished in a live setting, and the songs he played from last year’s ‘Before Today’ were just as refined as their studio-recorded album counterparts. Across on the Crazy Horse stage <strong>Floating Points</strong> delivered one of the festival’s most exhilarating and dance floor-friendly shows, with a live performance set to projected visuals. Floating Point’s Sam Shepherd set the groove just right, playing extended mixes of his spacey house jams, ‘K&amp;G Beat’ being a particular high point.</p>\n<p>Curators <strong>Animal Collective</strong> seemed very much in business mode during their ninety minute set, which was comprised of almost entirely new material. Those familiar with the Animal Collective live experience ought not to have been surprised, nor disappointed, as the new tracks were diverse and showcased the group’s constant ability to evolve and appropriate their varied influences to fascinating ends. Dave Portner, alias Avey Tare’solo LP ‘Down There’, released last year may not have lived up to the high expectations set by fellow Animal Collective member Panda Bear’s solo work, but was notable for Portner’s evocative vocals; and it was Portner’s voice which stood out again in the group’s performances on both Saturday and Sunday night. Sunday night saw an identical setlist; nevertheless renditions of four older tracks, ‘We Tigers’, ‘Did You See The Words?’, ‘Summertime Clothes’ and ‘Brothersport’ were predictably crowd pleasing. ‘Brothersport’ is essentially a dancefloor banger of the best kind, and when juxtaposed with material from the band’s ‘Sung Tongs’ era the progression of the group is evident.</p>\n<p>**Group Doueh **on Sunday lunchtime proved why they’ve been one of the figureheads in bringing the Sublime Frequencies label to a larger audience, producing an aural spectacle which proved that group leader Doueh is certainly not in the stasis that so many ‘World Music’ musicians who reach a Western audience often are. <strong>Prince Rama</strong> who followed on the centre stage were fairly derivative, and despite being far from awful they sounded (and looked) a little too much like a group in thrall of fellow New Yorker’s Gang Gang Dance.</p>\n<p><strong>Oneohtrix Point Never</strong> showed a pleasing progression from his early releases, retaining the elements of those works which gave his work its retrophilic charm, and his glimmering synth arpeggios formed part of a set in which he created some incredibly dense and interesting sounds. Both the music and the visuals may have been very much ‘ambient’, but the myriad intricacies of the noises he produced meant it was the weekends most sonically fascinating fifty minutes of music.</p>\n<p>A predictable no show from <strong>Zomby</strong> was a disappointment, albeit an expected one; and it meant a two hour gap on the main stage before Deerhunter songwriter Bradford Cox’s solo set as <strong>Atlas Sound</strong>. Cox, who was celebrating his birthday (and was presented with a birthday cake on stage by Ariel Pink and others), used various electronics but worked mainly with an acoustic guitar, and played material written as recently as last week, as well as tracks from 2009’s ‘Logos’. The combination of Cox’s vocals, the sounds of his acoustic guitar processed through a delay pedal and Kria Brekkan’s accompanying dancing gave his set an oneiric and spectral quality which was arguably unmatched over the course of the festival. He also drew attention to the tragic loss of Trish Keenan earlier this year, who was due to perform at the festival as one half of Broadcast.</p>\n<p>The aforementioned **Gang Gang Dance **were the penultimate act of the festival, and were utterly fantastic. Joined on stage by various friends and other artists performing at the festival, they  delivered on all fronts, with ‘Glass Jar’, the opening track of new album’ Eye Contact’, sounding glorious.</p>\n<p>It was arguably the most diverse All Tomorrow’s Parties festival to date, and for the foreseeable future at least it looks to be the last edition of the festival in May, with the organisers looking to put on more city based events in the summer; which seems a shame with the regards to the pretty dismal weather that can mar the December editions.</p>\n<p>Avey Tare described the weekend as ‘pretty cool’ – and I’m inclined to agree.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Having seen this night advertised several weeks prior we knew it wouldn’t be one to miss. I think it’d be nearly impossible to pin down one specific artist that made this night so special, everyone being on top form. Bearing our excitement towards this night we found it extremely surprising to enjoy so much dancing room, as we’d been anticipating the night sold out and packed from start to finish.</p>\n<p>Arriving to the ultra minimal dub-techno of Mark Ernestus, who is better known as one half of the Basic Channel production/label duo, made for a slightly disconcerting start. Focusing mainly on Rhythm and Sound era of his discography, Ernestus cast an atmosphere across the main room that was more akin to a mate’s smoky bedroom than a hopping club. Though the material sounded great on the Funktion 1 sound system, the set didn’t sit well given the knowledge that the likes of Addison Groove and Pinch would be raising the tempo later in the evening.</p>\n<p>At the top of the bill for the night was Berlin based Producer and founder of Skull Disco Records Sam Shackleton. I’ve been a fan of Shackleton and his apocalyptic, earth shaking minimal dubstep since purchasing Three EP’s sometime early last year. However there is nothing quite like the experience of Shackleton’s hypnotic tribal rhythms &amp; rumbling basslines in a club environment.</p>\n<p>Dubstep veteran Pinch acted as the perfect intermediary between Shackleton and Addison Groove exchanging his usual techno influenced dubstep for 808 dancefloor grooves. The Producer of the iconic 2007 dubstep album ‘Underwater Dancehall’ managed to push the boundaries of his well developed style over his set, showing his true versatility. After catching a small portion of his back to back set with Mala at the Ramadanman album lauch it was refreshing to see him experimenting with music maybe not associated with him and adapting to suit the set time by keeping the energy level high.</p>\n<p>I also managed to catch a word with Pinch after his set and confirm that he is hoping fly out to Berlin to work on his collaborative album with Shackleton over the summer which is certainly something to look forward to over the coming year. Its easy to see the Shackleton influence in alot of Pinch’s work as he takes on tribal rhythms, leaning towards the techno corner of the dubstep scene.</p>\n<p>In a recent interview, Addison Groove (Tony Williams’ footwork moniker) stated “It was either a new car, or an 808”, and I think I can speak on behalf of everyone at Corsica Studios on Saturday night when I say he made the right decision.</p>\n<p>Williams’ live sets are yet to gain legendary status but it is only a matter of time. Having not had the privilege of being alive in the hay-day of the drum machine boom of the 80s, it was refreshing to see elements of improvisation to the set as William’s dipped in and out of unrehearsed 808 freestyles. That isn’t to say it sounded at all passé. To the contrary, Williams’ occupied the space at Corsica remarkably well, with a scattering of soulful vocal loops and an impressive scope of deep resonances – giving the sound system (and the audience) a full workout. The end of the set was suitably weird – a half-time version of Footcrab followed by some exhausting 160+ bpm tracks that left the masses a little worse for ware. However, William’s doesn’t need to play up to the crowd anymore and can allow himself to pick his own, unique path to success.</p>\n<p>The last performance of the night was delivered by LA based producer Tokimonsta, djing using an APC40. I was slightly curious to see what Tokimonsta would choose to DJ, being the only hip-hop producer of the night. Sticking to her origins she brought out some current hip hop bangers such as ‘Drop’ by Earl from the odd future collective. In general Tokimonsta’s set provided a refreshing switch from the largely dubstep orientated night, and helped to ween us off thundering basslines.</p>\n",

Based in Shoreditch’s equally iconic Plastic People its doubtful as to whether the night would have risen from strength to strength were it not for the clubs superb sound system.<br>\n <br>\nI was slightly apprehensive because despite having been a fan of early dubstep and it’s more recent and house-influenced incarnations I was unsure the extent to which the over oscillated abrasive basslines (that has come to characterize the view of dubstep in wider world of music) had permeated the night that played such a great part in pushing (forward) the early experimental sound of dubstep.</p>\n<p>The line up was a varied one, Hessle Audio co-owner Pearson Sound was topping the bill (hailing from the more recent, house-influenced, end of the spectrum). Scene veteran N-Type was second down with the up-and-coming Hyetal taking the early slot. Hyetal played a set full of tracks I was familiar with however the overarching sound of his set seemed disjointed from the vibe that dubstep-purists in the (small) room cast. This wasn’t helped by his frankly, terrible mixing; something I was not experiencing for the first time. Having seen Hyetal play out twice now I’ve come to think his DJing will never live up to his considerable skill as a producer.</p>\n<p>N-Type took to the booth around 11:30 bringing an MC to sit in for the rest of the night. N-Type started well with some 140bpm tracks that all had the clear, pulsing bass-weight associated with the dubstep sound circa 2006, however about 15 minutes into his set it all descended into the saw wave mid range basslines I had been apprehensive of. Even when appreciating that this sound is a large part of the scene I still found it musically unadventurous  and a bit much to fill the best part of an hour set with. Several bar-trips and a sit-down later and the club seemed to be tiring of N-Type’s slightly formulaic track choices and cast their sights towards Pearson Sound who stepped up to the decks at about 12:30.</p>\n<p>Pearson Sound’s selection was a distinct departure from his usual 130-135bpm party sets that his recent Fabriclive mix showcased. Playing exclusively vinyl released during the 2004-2007 heyday of dubstep it was clear that he had put a lot of thought into his hour-and-a-half set. The mood he cast fit perfectly with the dark, enclosed space and incredible sound system of Plastic People. His set really played to the immersive qualities of early dubstep. Much of this feeling arising from the venue’s dark and simplistic characteristics, Plastic People clearly being the most fitting location for the “home of dubstep”.</p>\n<p>Forward may not be at the cutting edge of the UK underground in the same way it was 5  or 10 years ago, however it was unmistakably essential for the shaping of all modern dubstep sounds today, regardless of which strain of the genre you look at.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Aka Aka Roar and Deadly Rhythm have both been responsible for giving Brighton a much needed dance music pick-me-up in the last few months – putting on almost always the best nights with a near perfect booking policy, which makes you wonder why other sea-front clubs haven’t followed suit. Last Saturday they graced us with a night of Boddika &amp; Pariah.</p>\n<p>If I had any doubts as to who has been the most consistent, prolific producer in the UK in 2011, they were dispelled after an engulfing two hours of bass heavy electro from Al Green, alias Boddika. Green’s sound is self-styled as ‘EPM - electronic party music’, perhaps a little self-depreciating but refreshingly honest, indicative of a lack of pretension - a trait which one might not be surprised to find in a musician whose approach to writing music involves twelve hour sessions surrounded by instruments alone in a studio. This is serious music, but not <em>too</em> serious.</p>\n<p>Boddika’s set was filled with a plethora of tracks produced under the Boddika alias, in addition to productions as one half of Instra:mental. The euphoric dancefloor reaction to hearing the first few bars of ‘Soul What’ must have given Boddika plenty of self-confidence. He bravely held the rest of the anthem back a further ten minutes at least before finally bringing it back in; for all that, the second cheer of euphoria was quickly interrupted by his own unprompted rewind. It’s curious DJ quirks like these that make nights special and it provided evidence as to the status Boddika has managed to achieve within the dance music milieu. Tracks such as ‘When I Dip’, ‘2727’ and ‘Basement’ sounded absolutely huge, and the entire set was a perfect manifestation of Green’s tenacious production style, a sound Resident Advisor’s Andrew Ryce has described as similar to the Swamp81 label’s other output, but ‘with all the empty space and air sucked out, vacuum sealed tight’. The set rarely strayed too far either side of the 130bpm mark, and benefited by having a consistent sound of electro riddims and acid squelch.</p>\n<p>With the unenviable undertaking of following Boddika was Pariah, whose more multifarious set didn’t quite inspire to the same extent. That’s ok – few could be expected to raise a bar that was set at such a dizzying height but unfortunately, Pariah’s set had a certain unfocused element about it. Leaning sometimes towards Garage, other times towards UK Funky but with classics few and far between. Still, regardless of this, he gave an attestation to his talent as both a DJ and producer, which has earned him two releases on the R&amp;S imprint, and an ever-growing hype in the UK scene.</p>\n",

Whilst his side project is still taking shape Rumah has managed to secure himself forthcoming digital releases on the upcoming ‘No Stranger To Danger’ label with his unique blend of funky house, garage &amp; 303 finery.</p>\n<p>Laced through with lo-fi hits and bitcrusher, ‘Brian Ohno’ steers its way with true progression and diversity, through deep house, garage &amp; hard techno influences. The varied sounds and ambient backing swathes are reminiscent of ‘Tommy Four Seven’ styles. However, the track occupies a flowing, swung beat, setting it apart from a large proportion of the straight 4x4 techno out there.</p>\n<p>The techno scene has played a huge part in the shaping of the dubstep sound, producers like Pinch, Scuba &amp; Martyn all pioneering the crossover sound. However the emergence of ‘Future Garage’ - a recent offshoot of the dubstep scene (the term was coined by Sub.FM boss Whistla) is still in the process of embracing the techno sound. Brian Ohno however appears to be working the other way around. Whilst obviously predominantly a techno track, it is easy to pick out the distinct nuanced grooves and seperately pitched hi-hat sounds usually found in garage tunes.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F18273793&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Having recently become a resident at Brighton’s Aka Aka roar, Lorca looks set to finish 2011 with gusto. Especially since he’s been sharing bills with Peverelist, Joy Orbison, Blawan, and Objekt, not to mention forthcoming physical releases on both the Left Blank and Live Ones imprints. ‘Giant Star’ shows us why Lorca has been raising eyebrows in Brighton and showcases his talent as a sovereign of subtlety.</p>\n<p>The faint synth that opens Giant Star takes the lead throughout the track – grounding the beat and vocals into a smart, tightly packed sound with volumes of room left in the mix. The harmony between the busy, compacted high-end groove, and the tastefully restrained chords give this track it’s depth, and creates a pending suspense that stays with you all day. Whereas most producers would have brought up the cutoff of the mid-range up to reach a climactic (and predictable…) drop, Lorca leaves them as a muffled hum that swims around you, and settles into an immersed, heady intoxication.</p>\n<p>Compared with Lorca’s other tunes, ‘Giant Star’ has less of a club vibe and more of a stay-in-and-watch-the-rain feel to it. This could be because the dynamics aren’t as heavy as usual, or maybe due to the tune’s disquieting undercurrent. Either way, it will be interesting to see if he drops it at Stray Landings’ first club night on September 2nd, and perhaps more interesting to see the reaction.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F18505271&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Released in 2007, T2’s ‘Heartbroken’ firmly stamped the garage genre as an integral part of British popular music, when it peaked at no.2 in the charts. There are plenty of remixes of this pivotal garage classic out there, however it is rarely taken to so different and special a place, whilst also being instantly recognizable. Aubyn effortlessly pays homage to ‘heartbroken’ retaining those ever memorable vocal cuts but reharmonizing the track with beautiful contemplative guitar plucks.</p>\n<p>Burrowing underneath these elements, a warbling bassline bubbles beneath the surface building up texture. Working alongside this nervous gittering percussion stumbles through the intro, slowly building up confidence as the track progresses. Whilst the original track was undoubtedly made for the dancefloor, Aubyn takes the tune to a completely different place, conjuring up images of reflective evenings in hazy, smoke filled rooms.</p>\n<p>Kane Aris aka Aubyn is a Brighton based producer, who has previously circulated the band scene successfully with his outfit Groucho. Over the last year or so however he has been developing his own solo sound as an electronic artist, blending excellent live musicianship with engaging electronic production. Having played the wonderful Aka Aka Roar night, and our own Stray Landings event Aubyn is also a more than competent DJ.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F28028968&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Tanka once again exercises his well defined sound, and excellently crisp production with this dark, tribal thumper. Blending classic 808 dancefloor beats with more experimental sounds ‘Quicksand’ brings to mind productions from the likes of ‘Untold’ or ‘Objekt’ combining dry, erratic tribal percussion, with deep subs and twisted melodies. These intricate rhythms are driven along by Quicksand’s incessant bassline, plumbing its way forward right throughout the track. This is wonderfully ingratiated with the percussion, the bassline sound subtly migrates from a drum like muffled thumping into something alot meaner and more aggressive with a welcome injection of distortion. This added punch gives the bassline a taste of that late 90’s steroid pumping drum and bass sound.</p>\n<p>Into the second half of the track this bassline is accompanied by a delicate Kalimba melody, clarifying any ambiguity about the tribal influences of Quicksand.</p>\n<p>Francis Leigh aka Tanka, has been keeping up a production rate at the moment, with releases on ‘Hot &amp; Heavy’, ‘Sounds of Sumo’ &amp; Overcooked Records just too name a few. Tanka’s also keeping up appearances on the DJing side of things. With stacks of live shows under his belt, he played last Thursdays Corsica studios weekly event Church, alongside electronica meets garage producer Gang Colours.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F17692833&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Exposed to me by Stephen Jarvis (author of our last podcast) ‘Phanes’ ‘Lucky Woman’ is perhaps one of the most interesting and exciting tracks I’ve heard in the last six months. Taking a no holds barred approach to production, the breathtaking drop in the latter half of the tune is like having a bucket of cold water thrown over your head, as any lapse in concentration means missing the sublime fragmented samples, which jump in and out so quickly your never sure if you heard them or not. This is given significantly larger impact by its contrast with the opening two minutes. This builds up at a timid pace, via woozy jazz chords and sparse percussion, making the drop the much more welcome after the extended anticipation.</p>\n<p>After being used in Jamie XX’s essential mix for Radio One, Lucky Woman became a stand out track from this mix, capturing the imagination of the blog circuit and getting people asking ‘who is Phanes?’ Named George Siorvanes on soundcloud, the mysterious London based producer cites early Jazz as a distinct influence on himself, name dropping the likes of Charles Mingus &amp; Charlie Parker amongst his listening roster.</p>\n<p>Whilst it remains unclear whether the London based producer already has label association, this daringly forward thinking composition makes it certain that if he doesn’t currently he definitely will in the very near future.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F15650081&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Accurately classified ‘Soulstep’ on Egoless’s soundcloud, Rain Radio creates a hazy contemplative soundscape caked in airy atmospheres &amp; lo-fi sounds. The track features a variety of Tim Hecker-esque resampled pianos &amp; timidly sparse brass samples show Egoless is just as comfortable working with ambient textures as he is working with dub and club sounds.</p>\n<p>Rain Radio also features an enduring bassline which throbs its way throughout the track defining the rhythm, and subtly adding texture to the hesitant piano chords and hypnotic flylo-esque hand claps. Taking an overtly minimalist approach Egoless leaves his percussion completely stripped, rationing you with one kick and one snare per bar. This puts special emphasis on the timbre’s and sounds he does select immersing the listener even further into the depths of the finely honed sound world created by Egoless.</p>\n<p>From the distant lands of Zagreb in Croatia, Egoless is set to have his very first 12” vinyl release on the ‘Lo Dubs’ Label in January 2012, with his tune ‘Rainbow Dub’.

    "content": "<p>A couple of months ago the rapidly developing French label ‘B.YRSLF Division’, released their ‘Vybes Galore’ compilation, showcasing some of the best underground bass music floating around the interwebs. Despite the incredibly high caliber of this compilation, ‘Coolant’ by young up-and-comer Pedro123 stood out especially for me, epitomizing his incredibly unique production style. A style that’s also being shown support everywhere from the ‘Butterz’ label to ‘Boilerroom’.</p>\n<p>Rhythmically ‘Coolant’ is driven forward by 808 style kick drums and chanted vocal samples, not dissimilar to those used by Tanka in his track Quicksand which we reviewed earlier this month. These are accompanied by some wonderfully placed clicks and snaps taking the place of a conventional snare drum. Pedro123 keeps the experimentation rolling with his synth work, layering his sounds with metallic brushing samples adding that extra pinch of difference.</p>\n<p>Created earlier this year, the 17 year old South East London producer has a debut EP in the works which will be forthcoming on B.YRSLF Division. Alongside this he is working on a new project with a vocalist expected to be ready in the new year, and continuing his live appearances - the next being in Liege, Belgium.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F16475019&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Over the last few years R&amp;S have been re-establishing themselves at the forefront of techno and experimental electronica, pushing forward the likes of Blawan, James Blake, Untold, Space Dimension Controller and Pariah just to name a few. however the lineup for their curated warehouse project, took into account not only the current London based incarnation of R&amp;S, but also payed homage to the classic techno sounds of the original Belgian label, namely via legendary names such as  Andrew Weatherall &amp; Optimo Espacio.</p>\n<p>After a relatively late start, largely due to the amount of kit they needed to set up, Mount Kimbie took to the room one stage, presenting an excellent live formulation of their most successful tracks, such as ‘Mayor’ and ‘Carbonated’. I had been hoping to hear some new work from the London based duo, however they apologetically announced that their new work is still very much in the development process and would probably require more band members to perform which was a shame. Despite this I got the impression that Mount Kimbie’s live sets are developing leaps and bounds, with clever blends between songs, drifting somewhere between a mix and a band performance. However the incontestable highlight of Mount Kimbie’s set had to have been at the end when they welcomed James Blake onto the stage to perform an epic formulation of ‘Maybes’ perhaps the bands most influential track. Having previously performed with Mount Kimbie in the early days of their live shows, it was clear that the two acts are still extremely cohesive.</p>\n<p>This led nicely into Blake’s own live set with a significantly quicker setup time. I had previously been unsure as to how Blake’s live show would go down in a club environment, as much of his singer songwriter project is significantly more downtempo. However I was impressed to see that this had obviously been taken into careful consideration, and tracks such as ‘I Never Learnt To Share’ seemed to have been given a welcome boost to make them that much more dancefloor friendly.</p>\n<p>I was however dragged away mid way through James Blakes live set by the lure of Blawan and Pariah in room two. The pair who have recently joined forces for a project titled ‘Karenn’ were both representing their own sounds and influences, bringing to the palette a broad spectrum of House, Garage &amp; Techno. Progressing on from this, Hemlock co-owner &amp; Producer ‘Untold’ was next to step up to the decks, playing one of the strongest techno/dubstep sets I’ve heard.</p>\n<p>Finishing off the night in room one was Andrew Weatherall, a name i’m ashamed to say I was barely familiar with prior to the event. During his lengthy career Weatherall has worked  alongside legendary names such as Paul Oakenfold and Danny Rampling. He is also responsible for setting up the ‘Sabre’s of Paradise’ label and has had his own works released on high status labels such as Warp Records with collaborative projects such as ‘Two Lone Swordsmen’. Playing for several hours Weatherall’s seemingly covered only a small selection of tracks to absolutely no detriment, manipulating the audience with sublimely created breakdowns and buildups.</p>\n<p>Over the last few months Warehouse project have been putting together some of the biggest nights in the UK, hosting the likes of Aphex Twin, Zomby and Hudson Mohawke all in one lineup earlier this month. Mindblowing lineups like this, coupled with its stylish underground aesthetic means Warehouse Project is well worth a visit.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Bruises presents a selection of unlikely selection of samples, chopped, screwed and moulded into something truly atmospheric and wonderful. Sitting midway between ambient and some kind of industrial lofi techno, ‘Whistle’ introduces itself with floating atmospheric chords, before a bewilderingly heavy drop, stuffed with deep muddy kick drums and stifled vocal samples. Bruises cuts out most of the high frequencies for this tune, giving that ‘outside of the club atmosphere’ usually associated with ‘Burial’ or at the other end of the spectrum, Techno mavericks such as Monolake or Shackleton.</p>\n<p>Whilst ‘Whistle’ is very much beat driven music, Bruises also makes significicant use of his sample manipulation, bringing to mind the likes of ‘Tim Hecker’ or ‘Oneohtrix Point Never’. Bruises used a staggeringly large proportion of his own drum samples for this tune, making use of household percussion including glasses, keys and even banging against doors and walls.</p>\n<p>Real name Robinson Hearn, Bruises has recently had his debut release on the fast growing ‘Infinite Machine’ label, with his wonky dance EP ‘Introduce Me To Your Friends’. The 19 year old Coventry based producer is continuing to refine his sound and uncompromising blend of influences, ranging from Debussy, and Erik Satie, to current sounds propogated by labels such as  Hyperdub or Ninjatune.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F27762461&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Miami based house label PetFood, provides us with this soulful blend of funky house - courtesy of Taylor Freels aka. ‘Urulu’ for its 18th release. As the title track of Urulu’s EP, ‘Goodbye’s’ manages to wonderfully capture a lost era of classic 90’s house, with a twist of funky garage influence. Perhaps further inspiration from the retro-house sound, Goodbye’s features some exceptionally deep textured synths, vaguey reminiscent of ‘Fourth Wave’ star ‘Gerry Read’, or the work of minimal house wizard Jan Jelinek. Ingratiating itself nearly straight away, Urulu’s infectious synth line slowly burrows its way into your consciousness, leaving you truly hooked for the monumental build up mid way through the tune. This trick is similarly played out via Urulu’s soulful vocal slices, a signature of Urulu’s distinctive brand of retro-house.</p>\n<p>The 20 year old L.A based producer and writer at ‘Rebel Magazine’ is also keeping up DJing appearances, with upcoming shows from Santa Monica, to Hollywood and even New Zealand. Urulu has also more recently captured the imaginations of super blog XLR8 with an EP of Untitled works available <a href=\"http://www.mediafire.com/?qbe4hpd44ott3ra\">here</a> for free, so make sure to grab yourself a copy.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F17808843&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Released on the first imprint of up and coming London based label - 3rdeyeldn, ‘See You Again’ takes a wonky trip through loose melancholic synths, and downtempo, rolling percussion. With nods towards garage, downtempo, house and ambient ‘See You Again’ epitomizes many of the Genre’s explored by the young label developed early this year. The opening thirty seconds features a slow tempo build of thick arpeggiated synth notes, acting as a slow awakening before launching you into the rhythm. ‘See You Again’ is extremely diverse percussively, featuring a multitude of shakers, tinny snares and intensely reverbed claps.</p>\n<p>Dosage’s synth work also remains characteristically on point, perhaps the highlight feature of this track for me, being the futuristic warbling organ chords. With a variety of different melodic devices working together at the same time, Dosage places these varying distances in the mix, making the most important driving features stand out clearly.</p>\n<p>Underneath the moniker, Dosage is 17 year old art student Ben Swanwick currently studying at Watford. Having a close relationship with the 3rdeyeldn crew, Swanwick has an upcoming track titled ‘I Want You Back’ for the next Imprint being developed by the label.

    "content": "<p>Tarquin presents a disorientating formulation of avante-garde sounds fused together to create this airy jazz masterpiece. ‘Toe Marmalade’ jolts through areas of daringly bare minimalism, showing off clear jazz mastery in all its rawness. The extremely advanced musicianship is perhaps to be expected however, as 19 year old Dave Parsons aka ‘Tarquin’ has been playing piano since the age of 10, and guitar since 13. Stripped down areas are juxtaposed with explosively full drops, where previously isolated sections are brought together as a harmonious whole. Dragged forward by stumbling bedroom recorded kicks and snares the track tests its groove right to the limit, constantly on the verge of tripping over itself.</p>\n<p>With nods towards hip-hop, minimal, dubstep and garage, its surprisingly hard to pin ‘Toe Marmalade’ down to a specific genre when so many influences are fused yet remain so faithful. Looking towards James Blake, Burial, C.R.S.T &amp; LV for inpiration,  Parsons is looking to finish his debut EP as a promotional piece over the next few months, so eyes peeled for that. As well as this he will be releasing a tune entitled ‘Finger Pickle’ on our upcoming Stray Landings Compilation.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F9748765&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Szare’s previous take on techno [Action 5/Volya – Idle Hands] was a very different affair. His use of layers of wispy synths drew attention away from the beat and towards a wider atmosphere. 4th Street Jam however takes a more traditional approach, leaving us with much less of Szare’s amazing experimentation. Luckily ‘Alex Coulton’ has delivered this phenomenal remix, stripping the beat back and adding some wispy synths of his own. Coulton’s re-work adds some much-needed context, and pays a nice homage to the Szare’s sound from earlier this year.</p>\n<p>Coulton’s remix seems to be looking towards the legendary Berlin techno scene, to the extent that it wouldn’t sound out of place on an ‘Ostgut Ton’ Record. This track may not be looking to tear up any dance floors, yet it provides enough bass weight to be a welcome addition to any athletic 7 hour Berghain set.</p>\n<p>Having produced for around 3 years, the Manchester based producer also cites detroit house &amp; early dubstep amongst his influences. A little surprisingly perhaps, Coulton also cites ambient music as a large component of his listening library, namedropping the likes of ‘The Caretaker’ and creator of ‘The Disintegration Loops’ - William Basinski. With a selection of upcoming releases in the works, you can expect to hear the name Alex Coulton a lot more through the coming year.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F28516932&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Earlier this month, the blogosphere was blessed with a mass of new material put out by two independent websites – Life Crushed and That’s Deck. The compilation titled ‘Universal Hymns’ covers all manner of future garage, dubstep and basically anything innovative. A personal highlight, Monolith, comes from Portuguese producer Chainless. Following on from his first release,“Blue Days EP”, which came out in October 2011, Chainless again reminds us of how diverse UK-influenced dance music has become.</p>\n<p>Monolith is a 2-minute burst of a digital nightmare. Sprinkled with 8-bit bleeps and warbling synth chirps, it falls like raining drops of green matrix-style code in a Syd Mead landscape. The gutsy grime beat moves underneath, one step at a time, like a sea-monster against the current, held together with spacious clicks and snaps. An obvious comparison to make with Chainless’ music is to London genre-defying producer Zomby, especially his latest EP, <em>Nothing.</em> It’s certainly clear that both producers have one goal in mind, <em>atmosphere.</em> Everything else is secondary.</p>\n<p>However, it’s unfair to call Chainless just a Zomby-wannabe, Zomby himself only developed this sound recently, a huge departure from his rave-throwback sound of <em>Where were you in ’92?</em> Instead, we should just say that both are working on a different aesthetic plain from most, teasing out and enlivening flavours we simply have never tasted.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F31297394&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Although I’m actually sitting in a cold room at the dawn of January, its fairly easy to imagine lounging in the summer heat when listening to ‘Discorolla’ by Skips. An attractive combination of infectious meandering house beats and funky acid basslines lay this one down for a summer classic. ‘Discorolla’ also features some gorgeously smooth textured organ stabs, rolling underneath some gorgeously soothing soulful vocal slices.</p>\n<p>Outside creating fresh rhythms Skips is 25 year old Leeds residing Martyn Woolley. Alongside refining his own tunes Woolley is hoping to work on some new productions with friend and fellow producer ‘James Welsh’, who is set for a new release on ‘Losing Suki’ next month.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most comfortably sitting in the ‘Microhouse’ genre ‘Discorolla fills an interestingly unexploited gap in the evolution of the current UK dance scene. Whilst various formulations of house music continues to grow in the UK scene probably most notably Techno, Microhouse appears to have been missed at some point. Let’s hope artists such as Skips continue to fill the void.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F16686923&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>As if plucked straight from a nightclub scene in a Gaspar Noe film, ‘Taphonomy’ is a three minute battering of incessant kick drums and gut wrenching distortion. Being devoid of any melodic devices, the track instead creates its tension builds and releases through gradually developing reverbs, harrowing atmosphere pads and rasping bitcrush-crumpled samples. It only seems right that Taphonomy feature a variety of kick drum samples, considering its pounding four four beat. Switching between different samples provides an unlikely variant, allowing the track to retain its relentless atmosphere for the duration.</p>\n<p>With a selection of similarly themed, raw techno stompers available from Ontal’s soundcloud, they have recently been picked up on by Rob Booth, owner of the massively influential ‘Electronic Explorations’. ‘Penetration’ - another industrial strength track being featured in the most recent ‘EE’ podcast.</p>\n<p>Birthed a mere three months ago, Ontal is comprised of Serbian duo ‘Boris Noiz’ &amp; ‘Dekode’. Despite the project’s young age, Ontal are <em>already</em> in the process of negotiating a release &amp; have an upcoming show at ‘Failed Rituals’ in Berlin on the 10th of March. The pair cite a wealth of sources that influence their music hardly surprisingly; sci-fi films, industrial music, war, disease and apocalypse all rub off on the Ontal sound. With production, originality and atmosphere already under their belts, we can expect nothing less than great things from this pair in the future.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F31255009&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>For their seventh release, Hypercolour sister label Losing Suki bring us four tracks of smooth, neatly produced house, courtesy of James Welsh. Title track ‘Air Valley’ sets the mood for the rest of the EP, reconfiguring a vocal snatch from The Temptations’ ‘Papa Was a Rolling Stone’ against a background of warm synth tones and handclaps (put to liberal but pleasing use across all four tracks). The rest of the EP largely follows suit, with each track deploying vocal samples, all to gratifying effect.</p>\n<p>Third track ‘You’ is certainly the most driven and is best suited to the club, but the whole release seems befitting to both bedroom and dancefloor. With each track clocking in at around six minutes, Welsh gives his ideas time to develop without stagnating, a result many deep house productions stuggle to accomplish. This is evidenced on ‘Nastro Azzuro’, which gently adds layers before shedding them again ninety seconds from the end in an elegant breakdown. A very solid cut from a producer who I’m looking forward to hearing more from in 2012.</p>\n<p>Air Valley is set for release on Jan 30th, both as a 12” and digitally; until then you can stream it below.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F22654137&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>K S K is the project of London student Chris Kelly, who’s set out to form an idiosyncratic hybrid of dark industrial dance music and hypnotic tribal rhythms.  His newest gift to the public, ‘On Your Guard’ is as deep as they get, using a broad repertoire of production tricks and harmonic subtleties to soundtrack walks in the bitterly cold night.</p>\n<p>The bulk of the track moves you in unexpected ways, using an inventive scatter of snares and clicks. Part of what’s so impressive about this track is the fact that it uses a 6/4 rhythm to churn the beat through. It doesn’t sound forced either; it’s easy to bop your head to and helps to create a unique groove that I can’t really compare with anything. Perhaps more producers should take a leaf out of his book and make tracks in off-kilter time signatures. As the bass rumble, screams and palpitating drums all uncoil to a halt, it feels like what you just heard was just a nightmare, or momentary flashback of a bad trip. The truth is, you could be walking down Bedford Falls in “It’s a Wonderful Life” and still feel paranoid listening to this track.</p>\n<p>This is not helped by horror film style wolf-howls and vulture-screeches, which are not used sparingly within the track. Having them so high in the mix is a bold choice but it’s executed perfectly. They intensify the dissonance within the track, creating a harrowing atmosphere that never lets up, strangely reminding me of ‘Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima”, only digitized and danceable.</p>\n<p>There’s really no other way to listen to ‘on your guard’ than FUCKING LOUD. Listening to it from laptop speakers or indeed any speakers that are sub-par simply won’t do it. I urge you all to download this track (free from his soundcloud), and take a stroll tonight through the dampest, darkest area of wherever it is that you live and play this track as loud as you can through your headphones. Enjoy.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F33715774&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Just as I was beginning to think I couldn’t bear listening to another 808 beat, following its intense resurgence last year, I discovered the stunning array of work put out by South London Ordnance. Encapsulating many of the elements that constitute to his sound is ‘Ordnance Dub’ a dark, bass heavy assembly of fidgeting Techno. As if it can never sit still, Ordnance Dub features plenty of variations, it chugging bassline mutating every sixteen bars or so, and various spaceship style bleeps coming in and out of the mix. Combined with shuffling four four beats, Ordnance Dub wouldn’t sound terribly out of place on a Swamp 81 release, which SLO cites among his main influences. Ordnance Dub manages to create an intensely brooding atmosphere, something which seems to be a staple of most of his tracks. This is helped along by some strongly reverbed &amp; delayed synth squeaks, thickening up the atmosphere. As well as taking influence from the aforementioned Swamp 81 SLO also cites Ramp &amp; Teal Records as well as more experimental techno influences such as the work of producers Shed or Drexciya.</p>\n<p>Despite retaining his anonymity, SLO has still managed to cause quite a stir in recent months. Several of his tracks have been featured in a recent Mary Anne Hobbes mix as well as bagging a DJ slot with our friends over at Sub Skank, alongside Visionist &amp; Tanka. Producing under the name for a mere 8-9 months SLO has also managed to bag himself a series of releases throughout the year, his debut EP coming out on Dutch label ‘Audio Culture’ sometime in the next few months. Given the release of the Joy O &amp; Boddika collaborations at the beginning of the year, alongside up and comers such as SLO &amp; Tessela, we can expect it to be a big year for a bass heavy brand of UK Techno.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/south-london-ordnance/ordnance-dub\">Ordnance Dub</a> by <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/south-london-ordnance\">South London Ordnance</a></p>\n<p><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F33979085\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></object></p>\n",

    "content": "<p>No doubt most people are now aware of Zomby’s most recent controversy, an accusation of plagiarism from a little known producer in the UK bass scene - Reark. Whilst we may have become used to Zomby’s reputation for not turning up to shows, as well as sending arbitrary death threats to the likes of Roska, Ben UFO and various members of dubstep forum, plagiarism is something few of us would expect from a producer who obviously has much talent of his own. We caught up with Reark to find out abit more about this remarkable story.</p>\n<p><strong>Could you introduce yourself and tell us a little bit about your background in production?</strong></p>\n<p>I was always interested in making music from an early age. Around 2003 I bought a copy of Reason 2.0 and a controller keyboard, but it wasn’t until 2006-7 that I became more serious about producing. Moving to Calgary at the end of 2007 marked a big change, because via the “Electronic Music Club” run by Richard Reynolds (aka BrokenPaws) I met and collaborated with many local artists including Adam Geosphere, Aurchid, Honeey Mustard, Vi An, Lee Livingston, Lara T among others. With their help I got to play in clubs, street parades, music festivals and coffee shops. It gave me the discipline and motivation to try and bring ideas to conclusion.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you first hook up with Zomby?</strong></p>\n<p>We were introduced on MSN chat in the summer of 2007 via a friend of mine, MC Diamondog. The three of us were thinking of making a kuduro track together.</p>\n<p><strong>Did you find it difficult gaining recognition for your work from 4AD?</strong></p>\n<p>Not particularly. Once I was put through to the right person, I explained the situation and presented my evidence. My main concern was to receive credit for the track, and this they put right while preparing a one-off contract for Natalia’s Song.</p>\n<p><strong>The track was released in July last year, why did it take so long for this story too emerge?</strong></p>\n<p>I noticed in August 2011. 4AD updated their credits by late October 2011 — they were communicating with their web designers on the updating of the 4AD page. At that point I was satisfied with getting my due credit. Meanwhile, some of my friends were getting angry comments on YouTube after saying that the track had been written by me. At first, I resisted posting my evidence, but within the last weeks I was receiving inquiries myself on soundcloud.</p>\n<p><strong>How did Zomby respond when you complained to him after the release of 'Natalias Song'?</strong></p>\n<p>I sent him 10 or so e-mails and got a similar number back. Without going into the details, let’s just say it was difficult to have a sensible conversation about the matter. I think the line he decided to take was that I had only provided the vocal samples, and he did the rest.</p>\n<p><strong>Zomby has been caught out before regarding samples and plagiarism, his track ‘test me for a reason’ more than extensively sampling this ‘<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4vItkoMv2Y%20\">Alesis Micron Sound Design’ video</a>. Were you aware when you considered working with Zomby that this had been an issue previously?</strong></p>\n<p>I wasn’t aware of any previous issues. However, I quickly realised that he wouldn’t be keeping to the spirit of a collaboration, because once I had sent him the Reason files for Natalia’s Song he began to act as if the files were his. I never received any Reason files in turn.</p>\n<p>**After watching your soundcloud profile skyrocket since posting the original loop, do you think Zomby has innadvertantly done you a favour by creating so much **<strong>hype?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, I think that’s a fair observation. And I can thank him for the fact that a musical idea that began in my mind, together with Natalia Ladygina’s singing, became known to so many people. While I’m happy to make music for myself and friends, of course I’m proud that it has been so well received by a wide audience. It’s highly likely that if he had released it as a collaboration, I would have received much less hype. So in either ethical or cold-blooded terms, he has shown poor judgment.</p>\n<p>**Listening through to your other tracks, you can hear that ‘Natalia’s Song’ is born out of ‘your sound’ although it is at the same time fairly **<strong>distinct. Can you tell me a little bit about the track and how you came to produce it? What influenced you in creating it?</strong></p>\n<p>Natalia Ladygina and I had been thinking about making a track with her voice. Her cover of Irina Dubtsova’s “O Nem” is something she had to hand, so I worked with that. I cut up her sample in Recycle and tried to find musical possibilities in the pieces. This is relatively quick once you have the cuts mapped onto a keyboard, because you are bound to stumble across attractive combinations before long. The harmonisation of her loop with the modulated synth was probably a matter of luck. I rarely hear these things in full in advance. I first have to realise the first few steps to narrow down the choice before other factors (constraints on harmony, my musical taste) complete the phrase automatically. So had I been in another mood that day, I’m sure it would have come out differently. The second synth that ties up the phrase that sounds like a bit like a subdued brass/woodwind instrument is also 'automatic', and all over my other tracks. The only goal I had for the drums was to swing with Natalia.</p>\n<p><strong>How far are 4AD going to make sure you are properly credited? Are there going to be reprints of the vinyl with ‘Zomby/Reark’ on the cover?</strong></p>\n<p>I used the magic word ‘credit’ so many times in e-mails to 4AD I must have sounded tedious in the end. I don’t know if they plan to repress the vinyl. I would like to thank them for their fair-minded handling of this case thus far.</p>\n<p>For those of you that still have doubts about Reark’s story, you can view a video he posted isolating the different components of the track <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePnX24DjFZY&amp;feature=playerembedded\">here</a>. Obviously the issue of plagiarism is a very sensitive one, especially amongst a scene that for the most part remains all about the music. Maybe Zomby sums it up best in his own words from this <a href=\"http://www.dubstepforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=17188\">post on ‘dubstep forum’ </a>in 2007. Ironic huh?</p>\n<p>&quot;From names to beats as i jus see some tnuc called steve ZOMBIE not to mention every fucker skanking coki riffs, burial drums and loefah minimal halfstep „pls be original or FUCK OFF this scene doesnt need this shit its small enuff as it is.</p>\n<p>“If ud have robbed my tag as a kid id have split ur hed open with a can of hycote, dont think u can jack on ppls shit for easy ride in music and go unnoticed.”</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F35098735&showartwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

His most recent upload ‘Hunt’ remains characteristically solid, encapsulating many of the UK Techno characteristics being pushed by labels such as ‘Swamp 81’ or ‘Clone Basement Series’ at the moment. ‘Hunt’ seems to take a midpoint between several other Paleman tracks, retaining the pounding rhythms of ‘All Good’ whilst incorporating some of the more interesting tribal sounds used in ‘Sun Dance’.

    "content": "<p>Apologies to anyone getting sick of all this Techno we’re posting at the moment, there’s just too much good stuff about at the moment. My most recent finding ‘This Way Down’ by London based artist ‘Thefft’ experiments with Aphex style glitches, pitched vocals and some tastefully abrasive percussion. The majority of Thefft’s tracks might be loosely termed ‘Dub-Techno’, ‘This Way Down’ in particular being reminiscent of something Actress might produce, if he actually wanted to make something you could dance too. Percussively the track builds up slowly, distorted hat shuffles building underneath brooding, paranoid Dub-Techno chords. These slowly shake off atmospheric reverb in the opening section of the track before fully asserting themselves for the drop around thirty seconds in.</p>\n<p>Like Paleman, 19 year old Jack Robertson has forthcoming material with ‘Fulcrum Records’ (along with a release planned with ‘Embassy Recordings’). With a hotbed of young artists emerging on Fulcrum, as well as Damu himself, we can expect big things from the new label over this year. Thefft has only uploaded a short two minute clip of ‘This Way Down’, although from what we make of it it should be more than enough get you interested in this artist’s unique take on a crowded scene.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F35661865&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Moving in similar directions to the likes of Mount Kimbie, Airhead or Shlohmo, Ed Leigh fuses contemplative guitar work with raw, ultra clean electronic production. A quick browse through the 19 year old Preston based producer’s soundcloud reveals how refined his sound has become, all his tracks retaining the same hauntingly organic style.</p>\n<p>'It's Just' revolves around some gorgeously tender vocal snatches, alongside twinkling acoustic guitar plucks and gradually evolving percussion. The nice thing about the track's vocals is that they don't sound forced or overly manipulated, helping them to sink into the tracks atmosphere. The opening melancholic riff is retained throughout the track, being slowly developed and manipulated to wonderful dynamic effect. Ed Leigh sidechains airy atmosphere samples, and a droning bassline to rhythmically cement the track, allowing him to keep his percussion near the bare minimum. Interestingly the opening section works in the inverse of this, percussion being the dominant feature, before being overtaken delicate melodies, then steadily building itself back up again.</p>\n<p>For now Ed operates out of his own Bandcamp account so you can pick up his tracks there, although he is currently negotiating a release with a recently formed online label -  ’NeuroPlastic Records’, so keep an eye out for that over the coming months.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F28908833&show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Friend of the blog, Niall Lancaster, has done a pretty good job of keeping some great music from the public sphere for quite a while now. The caliber of his work has steadily increased from all sorts of sample-based electronics to an idiosyncratic take on house, particularly through the use of textual extremities and dark undertones, the likes of which sound alien and yet not unwelcoming. His latest instalment consists of two mixes of one track ‘Fuck What the Stars Say, We’re Compatible’ (his track names are probably some of the best I’ve ever seen in the ‘Of Montreal’ vein, personal highlight being; ‘Masculine Enough To Cry At The Notebook, Secure Enough To Dance With a Gay Man’).</p>\n<p>The first mix is a complex and progressive slow-builder, with every corner filled by a motif each more interesting and catchy than the last. With five or six sections and clocking in at just under 9 minutes, this is Niall’s longest track to date by quite a long way. However the second mix, dubbed ‘LAME VERSION’, is actually my favourite of the two, and by contrast has a very stripped-back minimal approach - bouncing the snares and vocal stabs off a chord sequence that ebbs and flows throughout the mix. There’s a contemplative calmness running throughout, reminiscent of work from The Knife siblings, Olof Dreijer and Karin Dreijer Andersson.</p>\n<p>Both mixes bring to mind Scuba’s latest album, ‘Personality’ due to an undeniable nod towards the 80s sound. Something about the catchy vocals snaps, jiggy bassline and reflective strings makes them markedly summery, nostalgic and ‘feel-good’. However, Scuba also comes to mind largely due to the production, which is frankly, immaculate. Every hit fills just the right amount of space in your head, and despite the intricacy of the rhythms (particularly in the percussive breakdowns) the mix is never weighed down by the amount of layers being played. It shouldn’t really come as a surprise to anyone that Niall studies sound production; it feels as if this level of sound quality can only come from years of practice, being taught by professionals, or in Niall’s case, both.</p>\n<p>If, like me, you’ve started compiling a playlist of ‘summer vibes’ for the next few months, there’s no excuse for excluding either of these mixes. I genuinely can’t imagine anyone finding it difficult to get down to them because of how instantly appealing they are. Basically, everyone blatantly needs to hear this on a system, so if there are any labels reading, contact Niall, release these track, play it out at a club and invite me, thanks.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F43255892&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F43252726&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Late last year <a href=\"http://amadeusrecords.net/\">Amadeus Records</a> was launched by the authors of Californian based art &amp; music publication, <a href=\"http://www.wearerebels.com/\">Rebel Magazine</a>. Alongside the birth of Amadeus an elusive new producer has emerged. Working under the name Lawrence Black he focuses himself on producing deeply emotive house. Whilst there is little material available online from Lawrence Black, we did manage to dig out this wonderfully rugged piece of throbbing House via his <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/lawrence-black\">soundcloud</a>. ‘Jess’ Groove’ builds off repetitive synth stabs and shudderingly deep kick bumps. The track distinguishes itself from others with a gritty,  distorted snare, riding on the off-beat. This gives the track a unique flex &amp; groove, something akin to the twitch of 90’s garage, albeit obviously in a wholly new setting.</p>\n<p>At 118bpm Jess’ Groove is a relatively slow House track, and doesn’t feel over complicated. This is probably just as well as it allows Black to make the most of some wonderfully expressive soul vocals, a staple of his productions. Whilst we can’t reveal a lot about this talented new producer, we can let you know that alongside working with Amadeus Lawrence Black has a forthcoming vinyl only release on a Manchester based imprint.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F41404813&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Kmag certainly didn’t get this prediction wrong, a favourite from his soundcloud ‘Images Of Bodies’ providing a dark abyss of mind bending, ultra-raw slow motion House. Stumbling kick drums stomp throughout the track, underneath swathes of radio-static and washing minor chords. Vessel doesn’t stint on effects, filters, bitcrushes and distortion sculpting a variety of timbre’s into a fractured digital sauna. Athough the track would undoubtably be termed under a dance music bracket, (either House or Techno) it takes alot from experimental influences, twitches, glitches and other sonic misdemeanours give the track alot of sticking power, setting Vessel aside from a lot of his contemporaries.</p>\n<p>Today has seen the release of Vessel’s second EP for the <a href=\"http://www.left-blank.net/\">Left_Blank</a> imprint, ‘Standard’. Consisting of three slow rolling dance-floor experiments, Standard promotes many of the aesthetics of Vessel’s previous work, whilst also unveiling a passion for some less obvious influences, such as Funk &amp; Disco. Considering the relatively young labels previous release from ‘Myown’ flexing unnerving guitar samples to their absolute limits, it will be interesting to see how far they venture down the experimental path.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F37564063&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

It seems that Techno these days can’t stop getting increasingly stripped down, and melody seems a thing of the past, leaving the emotive function down to the cold metal emptiness of it. The drums sound like shards of glass being ground down by a mortar and pestle and there’s wonderful interplay of the carefully crafted bass frequencies that swell and retain, giving it a distinctly evil sound, (as if it wasn’t dark enough already.)</p>\n<p>The emerging of this crunchy glacial sound I suppose originates from Blawan, who, since his meteoric rise to success in 2011, has left ample evidence of his influence in the wake – for instance see the likes of <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/tessela\">Tessela</a> or <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/paleman\">Paleman</a>. It seems that this track is perhaps more ‘inward’ in approaching an already existing standard rather than ‘outwardly’ innovative, but I don’t mind because it’s executed so perfectly, and the production is so spot-on.</p>\n<p>With forthcoming releases on Wigflex and Church, Happa’s new stuff isn’t going unnoticed.

Whether intended or not Boxwork dodges being genre-stamped, fusing a bewildering array of sounds that make it extremely difficult to pigeonhole his sound. In terms of the low end, the track brings to mind Drum &amp; Bass, featuring steroid pumping, sporadic warbling sub hits whilst the mid-range is covered by Techy stabs &amp; cleverly fragmented spoken word samples, reminiscent of footwork styles.</p>\n<p>Whilst there is little on the web about Boxwork, the 22 year old London based producer had previously worked as a Hip-Hop producer, before taking influence from the UK Bass scene, and switching up his style. Since working on these new Bass influenced productions, Boxwork has secured a forthcoming EP on ‘<a href=\"http://lonoteuk.tumblr.com/\">Lo Note UK</a>' scheduled for some time after the Summer months. The relatively young label is certainly one to keep an eye on, having released work from the likes of Tessela, Hackman, Wachs Lyrical &amp; Pusherman - we can imagine it really cementing itself over the coming year.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F40906328&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

His uncompromising hits stomp along in all the right ways. But what sets Mitternacht apart from the pack is how far Kommune1 pushes the abrasive side of his hits. Nodding almost all the way back to 94’ he brings Regis-esque extremities into a much more relevant framework. Beneath all that lovely noise Kommune1 is playing with some really creative drum sounds that keep the track propulsive. Moving from the cleaner sounds of our time Mitternacht is a pretty progressive track that doesn’t lose any friends on the dance floor.</p>\n<p>What we have here is a winning combination of boundary-pushing dynamics with shaking grooves that will make people frown and flail at the same time.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F40808933&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Taking influence from various strains of House music, Kahwe has been carving out his own distinctly organic take on the genre. Yew places Shlohmo-reminiscent percussion &amp; ambience into the context of something like <em>Deep</em> House, fusing a beautiful array of delicate clicks, ticks &amp; whispered voices into something highly atmospheric. Whilst the opening 30 seconds of oddball percussion may make you wonder where the track is headed we can promise its worth the wait. Reorganizing itself alongside timid sine wave chords, Kahwe’s gritty percussion develops an ever so slightly off beat 4/4 rhythm. In a scene where 70% of tunes sample the same Brandy or Aaliyah acapella its refreshing to see someone use vocals tastefully, letting them support the track rather than dictate it.</p>\n<p>The 20 year old may be familiar to people under his usual guise Medla, whilst he keeps the Kahwe moniker for deeper, more experimental productions.

    "content": "<p>There are few producers out there who consistently manage to maintain a sound unlike any other, where influences are apparent and yet contorted and mangled into their own anomalous shape and size. Kane Aris, going under the moniker Aubyn, has managed to do this for a few years, and for this I hate his guts out of pure jealousy. ‘See a Light’ is the first track from an EP of the same name, and accomplishes startling originality with expert precision.</p>\n<p>Perhaps one reason Aubyn stands head and shoulders above many producers in the increasingly overcrowded scene is his use of vocals. See a Light’s title track hears Kane’s voice for the first time in quite a while. It’s a feature I hope he continues to drop in with future productions because of how distinctive and emotive it can make his music. Aubyn’s singing often reminds me of a ghost speaking from a watery grave; I put this down to his taste for drenching his voice in swathes of warbling effects and cavelike echoes, leaving it distant and hallucinatory.</p>\n<p>The same deliriousness (and sometimes nauseating) power of Aubyn’s vocals on this track can also be said of the overall production, particularly the wavering synths and flickering hyperactive whistles that gives it the unmistakable smoky-haze aura of a bedroom recording. There’s something simultaneously rough and yet polished about Aubyn’s stuff, which kind of reminds me of Gerry Read or Actress. This could be because the sounds he uses come from anywhere between sampling forgotten vinyl to processing synthesizers through a guitar amp. And yet, despite all this, all the elements are somehow strung together with staggering cogency, making them listenable for anyone, and perfectly appropriate for a club-environment. This can be seen in See a Light wit the 140bpm kick n clap beat that pushes the whole thing forward and makes it easily danceable.</p>\n<p>There’s little doubt in my mind that any day now, Aubyn is going to find some sort of musical success, purely for his refreshing imagination and his exceptional production. Check out the See a Light EP sampler below and see if you don’t agree.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F44964841&show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Future Garage is a fairly maligned term within dance music circles, and while for the most part I find its omnipresence pretty noxious, I don’t think it would be an unfair label to attach to this 140bpm roller from Rommek – it’s what I’d like Future Garage to sound like, rather than what Future Garage sadly normally <em>does</em> sound like. Although sampling Brandy &amp; Monica’s ‘The Boy is Mine’ seems to have become a rite of passage among producers in the genre, Rommek’s appropriation of said track’s opening line (perhaps tongue in cheek), allows it to take on a different tone here, especially during the atmospheric mini-break about 2.45 in.</p>\n<p>The track has three distinct parts. The first couple of minutes build gradually, and so the track never really drops but just becomes more densely laden with percussive elements until the undeniably fat bassline (Zed Bias would be proud) drops a couple of minutes in. The hectic mid-part gives way another two minutes later, before the track reconfigures with a more DJ-friendly 4/4 kick for the last section.</p>\n<p>Asides from producing, a glance at Rommek’s soundcloud reveals that he co-hosts a bi-weekly radio show on Devon’s <a href=\"http://www.soundartradio.org.uk/\">Soundart Radio</a>; and he’s an adroit DJ too, as evidenced by his appearance at Corsica Studios for <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/churchofficial\">Church</a> earlier this month.

    "content": "<p>Member of the Southampton dance music diaspora SO15 and friend of the blog, Joe Sanchez has been plugging out tunes for a while now. Now producing under the name Kam Moda, Joe’s tunes have shifted well and truly towards the techno end of the spectrum. This is a good thing.</p>\n<p>'Swan' has some seriously subtle progression going for it. An intro that lulls you into a warm bed of spacey dub-techno quickly gives way to a tight, propulsive flex. Kam Moda's unconventionally produced hits keep the track danceable until it recedes back into the roomy atmosphere of the intro. All in all 'Swan' is a creative track, It doesn't cut corners or whore itself out to the gun fingers. Instead it keeps its dance-floor credentials while making headway through a variety of unexpected sounds.</p>\n<p>Catching the ear of an unnamed record label and several YouTube rippers along the way, Sanchez’s reinvention as Kam Moda has proved fruitful. Keep your ears open for his future endeavours.</p>\n<p>You can also catch Joe and the rest of the SO15 crew at their regular room 2 takeover of Southampton’s NoLogo night.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F34734411&show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>As summer begins, and I gradually fill my time with drowsy indulgences in the sun, I am always reminded of how much I enjoy listening to slow-paced sleepy kind of music, when I too am feeling rather slow-paced and sleepy. The new offering from Brighton-based Memoryloop sits very comfortably with my docile summer haziness and washes over me with patience and courtesy.</p>\n<p>The warbled steel-pan synths flood around you and give <em>Illuminate</em> a distinctly stretched out quality, which creates an indelible atmosphere like some ethereal dream. The heady intoxication of the chords are helped along by the panned kit sounds, that grudge along lazily as they float around the stereo image. The celestial pianos and pitch-shifted vocals that appear in <em>Illuminate</em> (and much of Memoryloop’s work) display a potential influence from Boards of Canada, whilst remaining considerably more welcoming and approachable than the Scottish duo’s often threatening or disquieting undertones.</p>\n<p>With less than 100 followers, and some wonderfully innovative music, it’s fair to say that Memoryloop’s following doesn’t match his talent. I suspect that this maybe due to an introspective, humble approach to his music, as he rarely uploads tracks and doesn’t advertise himself as much as he perhaps should. Furthermore, this could be suggested by the music itself, which is also markedly introspective. Nevertheless, I hope Memoryloops isn’t put off by his small following, and continues to write the score for my half-remembered sunny afternoons.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=196515556/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://memoryloop.bandcamp.com/album/illuminate\">Illuminate by memoryloop</a></iframe>",

Accentuating intricate shuffling House rhythms, relaxed spoken word vocal fragments slowly shift from a background atmosphere to a key rhythmic component.

    "content": "<p>Originally the project of Samir Alikhanizedeh alone, the young beatsmith has recently adopted two more members to his project ‘Zadeh’ - Jacob Millson &amp; Al Gill. This new move brings live musicianships to the table, giving the project a new band orientated outlook. The newly formed trio have recently uploaded two takes of a phenomenally deep new untitled production, although it is the live version that stands out for me, displaying as much talent in live musicianship as it does mastery of electronics.</p>\n<p>Taking as much time necessary for the introduction, the track opens with heavily reverberated atmospheric guitar strums, which are tamed at just over a minute in by side-chaining kick drums creating a melancholic swell throughout the whole track. Heavy side-chain is also applied to strung out vocal outcries, which weaves a sense of desperation into the soothing textures of the track. The obvious reference point for this track would be <a href=\"http://www.mountkimbie.com/\">Mount Kimbie</a>, although despite the similarities the group have tapped into something more representative of themselves and managed to carve out there own sound albeit using a similar setup.</p>\n<p>Making the shift from purely laptop based music to incorporate organic live recordings is a mature move for the project, and is likely to set Zadeh apart from many of their contemporaries. Consider us well and truly intrigued by the project and awaiting new productions with eager.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F48975456&show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Born and raised Singaporean Lee Xhin may be better known to you as just ‘Xhin’ for producing some of the darkest, deepest techno soundscapes out there. Having earned his stripes with debut releases on ‘<a href=\"http://www.meerestief.com/\">Meerestief Records</a>’, Xhin is now firmly rooted in the <a href=\"http://www.stroboscopicartefacts.com/\">Stroboscopic Artefacts</a> crew, having released a slew of EP’s as well as the stunning <em>Sword</em> album. Along with label owner and co-producer Lucy, Xhin has also been rapidly growing his name playing sets all across the globe.</p>\n<p>He has also managed to gain the attention of some big names, brandishing support from the likes of Ben Klock, Silent Servant, Speedy J and Luke Slater. If this wasn’t enough Xhin also has a well established relationship with Resident Advisor, providing their <a href=\"http://www.residentadvisor.net/podcast-episode.aspx?id=286\">286th RA mix</a> and playing their stage at the short lived Bloc festival.</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago we were given the privilege of having a chat with Xhin about his work, life in Singapore and his increasingly busy DJ schedule.</p>\n<p><strong>Not that I’m an expert on the island’s music scene, but I imagine being brought up in Singapore Techno wasn’t the most obvious musical pathway open to you.   What was it that drew you towards the sound, and how did you first gain recognition in the scene?</strong></p>\n<p>I remember the very first time I was introduced to Techno, those hypnotic dissonances, alienated soundscapes, 909s and 808s had got me going “this is the future, Techno music is the future. I want to be a part of it.” First recognition, back in 2006 or 07 I think, came from a remix I did for this guy from Dublin by the name of Five Green Circle and that remix went into Loco Dice’s Timewarp Mix Compilation. Bizarre.</p>\n<p><strong>STo what extent has growing up in Singapore influenced your style? Do you think being signed to German Record labels has affected your approach to making music?</strong></p>\n<p>It doesn’t really matter where I grew up or am I living. I have always been living in my own little world where I just do my thing without too much concern about what’s going on here in this city. I know it’s unhealthy but I think it’s kind of great actually. You know, the more you don’t care about it the more you want to take risks and make it happen. And I’ve always believed one’s style is all about individuality and dignity. Whereas music labels are just music labels. No matter which one your signed to, you need to sound like yourself.</p>\n<p>**Whats it like working with Stroboscopic Artefacts? I saw some of the label showcase in Berlin, and it seems like a very tight knit group. **</p>\n<p>It never gets any more fun than working together with a group of good friends.</p>\n<p><strong>Your work seems to stand up to the album format incredibly well, where many dance music producers fall down. When you write an album is it a preconceived idea or do you tie together tracks of similar styles after writing them?</strong></p>\n<p>For sure a certain idea or a concept has to be thought out thoroughly and uncompromisingly before I start working on an album or say, any releases. For the album format, I want people to enjoy electronic music not only at the club but also at home. It’s that kind of balance you know. I know Techno producers typically would rather release albums that only contain DJ friendly tracks. By doing that, it’s much safer so to speak. Where more DJ’s would eventually play and chart up the tracks. But that’s not my point and it’s something that I’m not really keen to do.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8287/7534497408_314aa0cd3d_z.jpg\" alt=\"Photo Credit // Minus Plys Forward\"></p>\n<p><strong>Your music has some quite distinct sound design elements to it, is this something you’ve studied academically or something you’ve learnt yourself over time?</strong></p>\n<p>I started to have an obsession of studying manuals from every synthesizer I purchased in the early days. That was pretty much where it all begun.</p>\n<p>**Techno is the obvious tag for your music, but I can also distinct IDM &amp; ambient influence in some of your work. Which artists would **<strong>you say have been the biggest influence on your productions?</strong></p>\n<p>There are too many to name, really. So I’m just going to randomly select a few out of the loads: Jeff Mills, Yellow Magic Orchestra, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Aphex Twin, early works from Ken Ishii and Dead Can Dance.</p>\n<p><strong>And which artist’s are you particularly feeling at the moment?</strong></p>\n<p>I have gone back to listening to Kritical Audio lately. And some Holy Other.</p>\n<p><strong>Could you tell us a little bit about your live shows? I’ve read that you have a fairly interesting setup, and like to experiment with different controllers.</strong></p>\n<p>I used to perform with Traktor, moved on to Ableton for some fun and now I’m back on Traktor, and mix with a mixer again together with Allen &amp; Heath Xone K2 as the main MIDI controller. Recently I just got the Traktor F1, another controller of cos, for sample triggering on the Remix Deck built inside Traktor to enhance my DJ sets. Been experimenting with the F1 quite a bit and almost ready for use at upcoming shows. It’s going to be fun.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you like to begin your live sets at the moment?</strong></p>\n<p>It depends where I play really. Different place, different mood, different vibe.</p>\n<p>**People have been calling Bloc the worst festival they’ve ever been to. How was it for you? **</p>\n<p>Chaotic. However, besides all that madness we went through and come to think about it, it wasn’t that bad after all. At the RA Hub I unexpectedly played a 2 hour set instead of the hour set it had been scheduled for. For me, that was totally cool and hopefully for the people who stayed, they were happier having me play a bit longer. And also, I had fun playing for Boiler Room on the ship as well.</p>\n<p><strong>What can we expect to hear from you in the near future?</strong></p>\n<p>Hopefully a new Xhin sound in the near future? Maybe…</p>\n<p>You can catch Xhin finishing off his latest European tour on September 7th at The <a href=\"http://www.rhythmfactory.co.uk/\">Rhythm Factory</a>, London.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F882984&show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>It has been said that Steve Reich started dance music before dance music was dance music. He is often held up as the Godfather of the hypnotic minimalist repetition that is so prevalent in Techno and House today. As such, there have been numerous attempts to remix his works, whereby producers create a DJ-friendly homage to their hero. Unfortunately, the remixes often come out sounding cheesy or muddled (perhaps with the exception of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ls1v2p84sM\">Vakula’s acclaimed remix of last year</a>.) Usually I would just rather listen to the original, but the same cannot be said of HNNYs new edit of the classic ‘Nagoya Marimba’.</p>\n<p>Where many remixes of Reich often suffer from a lack of the mesmeric hypnotism that makes minimalism so appealing, HNNY manages to strike a perfect balance between something simultaneously anodyne and animated. It’s entirely appropriate for both beach-party nights out or solitary nights in. In the same way that listening to Steve Reich after 10 minutes can begin to make one feel strange and unearthly, HNNYs edit achieves the same progressiveness by steadily increasing more and more subtle discordant elements and harmonic nuances into the mix.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite components of this track is the creative use of Bass Guitar, which adds a refreshing punchy quality, and helps lift it up where a conventional sub bass sine wave would have muddied the sound. This slow, chilled house groove, in combination with the live instruments almost sounds like it could be a real-time performing band, which reminds me of the likes of <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/stimming\">Stimming</a> and <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/erdbeerschnitzel/\">Erdbeershnitzel</a>), and shows us that 110 bpm has a lot to say for itself. On the B-side there’s an equally interesting and innovative re-edit of a Dorian Concept track, and judging how quickly the Vakula edit sold out, I doubt it will be around for long so <a href=\"http://www.phonicarecords.com/product/view/108039\">GO BUY IT</a>.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F47332815&show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Wizard Sleeve, a multimedia arts company made up of 8 DJ’s, 2 VJ’s, 1 artist and a cunning entrepreneurial spirit, may leave you wondering what they have up their Sleeve next. The collective run a fortnightly show on Surrey’s KaneFM, Nottingham’s RogueFM, regular UStream house party’s (with their own custom built system) and a website/blog.</p>\n<p>With bass, beats and boat feet, Wizard Sleeve bring us their first release: ‘Beat Emporium Vol. 1.’ Coinciding with the launch of their new website, the Wizards offer us a welcome diversity of music from accomplished beat makers within the electronic/dance music field. Made up of friends, music undergraduates and the collective’s musical family, the love is not only felt within the music but between the producers themselves.</p>\n<p>From the first crackle of Theoish’s fruits of crate-digging labour Wizard Sleeve draw us into a world of serenity and textural bliss. The delicately bit-crushed synth line leaves me in a state of reflection further supported by Oli Slack’s ‘Wonderland.’ Spurring a nostalgic eye shift to the far left, ‘Wonderland’ leaves a contented smile on my face. The obvious Disney comparison can be made but the piano and harp-sounds work so very well with the childlike vocal snippets.</p>\n<p>A transfer of energy to a more club friendly angle comes in the form of Lisson’s LFO chordal roller ‘Let Go’ and Sizlak’s ‘Chicago, New York.’ Ramadanman-esque shakers, gloopy clicks and fluttering flick book percussion sounds make ‘Let Go’ a perfect example of the compilations attention to textural interest and forward thinking production values. I would normally stray away from the chordal LFO sound in vogue, but Lissons take on the sounds use within the structure and format of the track is commendable. Thick and crispy hi-hat textures, a surgical attention to frequency, and incredibly tight production, make Sizlaks ‘Chicago, New York’ a dance-floor contemplator to be reckoned with.</p>\n<p>With the summer in full swing Okota’s ‘Run the Rhodes’ is a perfect soundtrack to the festival fuelled summer. The tune is centered on a garage aesthetic with an organic time feel and a wonderfully engineered double bass and Fender Rhodes. This is supported by the original and imaginatively edited versions of the vocal, sharing similar levels of artistry with Thology’s re-fix of Caribou’s ‘Lalibela.’ This is a great example of an effective re-work largely made up of the vocal breakdown three-quarters of the way through the original. Perhaps my favourite musical element to this is the tender side-chained chords loosely following the chord pattern of the original.</p>\n<p>In the compilations penultimate and somewhat humorous production, Zak Christ presents an alter-ego through a voice generated cow. At 2 mins 35 the square wave padded, dense and warbling climax gives the track a moment of semi-seriousness; Christ is ‘master of cows.’</p>\n<p>Wizard Sleeve’s Beat Emporium Vol. 1 is concluded tastefully with the deep sounds of Kinlyf. The Schaefferian soundscape took me down a clicky and cinematic route with the use of camera sounds and eerie shakers. ‘Protean’ would be both a place of solice on the dance-floor and a proficient soundbed for a crime thriller.</p>\n<p>Download the full compilation <a href=\"http://wizardsleevecollective.bandcamp.com/album/wizard-sleeve-beat-emporium-vol-1\">here</a>, or visit their <a href=\"http://www.wizardsleeve.co.uk/\">website</a> for more updates.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F54127459&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Sean Hughes aka Rumah is long overdue for a Stray Landings track review. This is partly due to the fact that by the time we’ve heard one great track, he’s already churned out another. Doubtless his movement through better and more nuanced stylings will continue, but for the meantime, <em>Dalton</em> has left us thoroughly impressed.</p>\n<p>Whilst remaining in the same locus of techno musings that Rumah has been working with as of late, <em>Dalton</em> sees him delve deeper into distorted, industrial influences, akin to that of Regis or Perc. I have come to expect at least some degree of 303 bass work in Rumah’s productions, however this element is replaced by a punchy retro style synth melody in <em>Dalton</em>, filtering in and out through the latter half of the track. This infectious electro riff gives <em>Dalton</em> a strong Detroit influenced sound, allowing it to act as a potential bridge track between different dancefloor stylings.</p>\n<p>The last few months have proved to be a somewhat crucial period for the London based producer and DJ. July saw the release of his first 12” record as the debut offering from newly founded Nineteen89 Records. Following this Rumah has been generating a steady stream of respectable publicity from the likes of Hyponik, Drowned In Sounds &amp; DJ Mag. No doubt the next few months will prove equally as fruitful, with his track <em>Stutter</em> scheduled for a 12” release as part of a new EP. As well as this those of you jetting out to Croatia for Dimensions festival you will be able to catch a DJ set from the up and coming producer.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F56213600&show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Reminiscent of the work of Anton Zap or Jan Jelinek, _Runner _is a subtle take on the house genre, reducing its crucial aspects down to a pleasantly hypnotic, ultra-stylish affair. If repetition is the defining element of dance music Cownie master’s it perfectly, a variety of grainy, multi-timbral synth samples are developed at a restrained pace in a tightly locked micro-house groove. Complementing this, <em>Runner</em> features some rather heavily processed soulful vocal samples that remain characteristically minimalist. Drenched in reverb and a touch of delay, these increase the frequency of their appearances as the track progresses, leading up the final third of the track. This segment see’s the introduction of some discordant synth stabs breaking the dream like atmosphere developed up until this point.</p>\n<p>The rest of Cownie’s soundcloud page shows the 22 year old producer can also boast significant versatility, his tracks all displaying different qualities from the sinister, Dusky style roller_ Eastern,_ to some fantastic disco-house edits in the form of <em>Children Of The Night</em> or _Tell Me What You Want. _Having originally grown up in Cheltenham on a diet of Jazz and BeBop standards, the now Leeds residing producer and DJ takes influence from the output of forward thinking labels such as Hessle Audio, Hemlock and Hotflush, as well as deep house labels including AUS music, Moon Harbour and Tsuba Records.</p>\n<p>Those of you in the Leeds area may have in fact already witnessed performances from Cownie, as he does residencies at a number of local nights, including one at Oscillate Wildly, and one at Bigger Than Barry.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F56428346&show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Saturday 18th saw the release of the third in Life Crushed’s ‘Favored’ series, and by the sounds we’ve heard so far is likely to be the strongest of the trio. Previous editions of the Favored series have featured contributions from the likes of Bwana, Bruises, iO and Bondax. This latest offering in the series features contributions from a healthy assortment of musical outlooks, the weighty eighteen track compilation exploring sounds as far ranging as footwork, grime &amp; techno along with some decidedly more introspective downtempo experiments.</p>\n<p>With so much range to choose from picking a favourite was always going to be difficult, although the track that stood out for me was ‘Pheromone Groove’ by Kongoko. Having followed Kongoko’s productions for a little while now I was mildly surprised to see him doing something i’d class as slightly outside his usual tag. However this isn’t to say Pheromone Groove doesn’t live up to his excellent production standards, on the contrary I’d argue it probably exceeds them. Melodically the track is reminiscent of Fantastic Mr Fox’s signature future soul/R&amp;B synthplay, although percussively packs a lot more punch, keeping more in common with Kongoko’s usual hectic approach to footwork-esque rhythms. It is perhaps this combination that gives Pheromone Groove the edge, making it perfect for in the club but with enough sonic texture for home listening as well.</p>\n<p>Whether or not Life Crushed are aware that they could easily be charging for this fantastic assortment of music we are not sure, however we strongly advise you take advantage of their generosity and hit the <a href=\"http://lifecrushed.com/post/29729236165/life-crushed-presents-favored-iii-more\">download button</a> before they think better of it.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F52071135&show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>RKSS’ Basement EP feels partly Andy Stott, partly Bandshell, but for the most part, feels entirely new. Grainy synths, richly organic percussion and awkward shuffling rhythms are presented in a way that sounds unforced and perfectly natural. Despite the apparent ease of RKSS’ production, the tracks still manage to retain the kind of depth of field you’d associate with hours of painstaking work on atmospheric field recordings, carefully tweaking EQs, compressors and reverbs.</p>\n<p>Title track <em>Basement</em> gives the strongest hints of the aforementioned possible Andy Stott influence, the tracks unrelenting four to the floor rhythms characteristic of Stott’s smouldering take on techno. What is perhaps most interesting about this track though, is the upfront mechanical clicks that sound like they could have been taken straight from a German Expressionist factory soundscape, akin to Metropolis etc. Whilst <em>Basement</em> is largely centred around its twitching, stumbling rhythms, the track is propelled by dark and imposing, and yet rich and welcoming synth washes, especially during the noisy build that seems to always go one step further than you expect it to.</p>\n<p><em>Push</em> carries many of the same themes over from <em>Basement,</em> a claustrophobic monotony puts the listener in a weirdly haunting place, juxtaposed by angelic melodies taking it to an unearthly celestial field that makes Actress’ R.I.P spring to mind. <em>Far</em> also leaves this lingering imbalance of jittering restlessness with celestial serenity, and ends the EP with a question mark both mystifying and intriguing. Great stuff.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"320\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F1844327&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Surprisingly Stephen Pelling’s bruised and battered post techno project Magnetic Northwest has only been in operation for the past eight months, not something you’d expect to to hear given the calibre of one of his most recent offerings, <em>Hunted</em>.</p>\n<p>Glitchy and distorted from the get go, _Hunted _utilises many of the themes exploited by the likes of Actress and Tommy Four Seven in its appreciation of crumbling lofi textures. Abrasive static laden samples are tied together by the introduction of a dark relentless kick drum, driving the track forward in a hazy drunken march. <em>Hunted’s</em> thumping rhythms are amplified by the addition of what we can only assume are grainy shredded vocal cuts, adding a resonant punch on the offbeat. Despite the multi layered percussive textures Pelling makes use of, the track still manages to retain a feeling of simplicity, preventing its finely detailed soundscapes becoming overbearing.</p>\n<p>Three minutes in sees a dramatic twist for <em>Hunted</em>, the Preston based producer introducing a rampant squelching acid bass sounds throwing a whole new perspective on the track. Following an intensely dark atmospheric build up, the introduction of these sounds puts a nostalgic twist on the track, subtly bringing to mind the tearout acid-tech sounds popular through the early nineties.</p>\n<p>Keep an eye out for Magnetic Northwest’s debut EP, expected to coincide with several live appearances around November.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F56826959&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Whilst techno has been coming back into the popular eye over the past six months or so in the UK, Ali Wells aka ‘Perc’ is certainly no stranger to the genre. Having had his earliest release is 2002, Well’s has released on a multitude of well renowned labels such as CLR, Kompakt and Stroboscopic Artefacts just to name a few. Although originally growing up in Hertfordshire, the bulk of his career so far has been lived out in London, his productions often said to absorb and translate the city’s atmosphere.</p>\n<p>However, Perc’s name is not just highly-respected for his releases. In 2004 he founded his own label, ‘Perc Trax’  producing its debut release ‘Ice Cream For Kenton’. Perc Trax has since developed from just a vessel for Well’s own productions, and has become a haven for forward thinking deep house and techno. Releases have come from the likes of Sawf, Truss and Ed Rush, and the label’s artist roster continues to grow. Perc Trax also put out perhaps Well’s best received work, the 2011 album ‘Wicker &amp; Steel’.</p>\n<p><strong>Why don’t we start with what you’ve been up to lately and how this year has been for you?</strong></p>\n<p>This year has been great so far, my EP ‘A New Brutality’ did really well and caught the attention of a lot of people outside of the techno scene which was one of its main aims. I’ve also been gigging across Europe and in Japan, the USA, Australia, and Singapore. It’s been great really. Right now I am coming to the end of a run of remixes for Factory Floor, Truss, Mark Stewart and Black Asteroid, once they are done I really need to get my head down and work on some tracks of my own.</p>\n<p><strong>So your label Perc Trax has been running for roughly eight years now, what were your original intentions for the label, and how have you seen it develop?</strong></p>\n<p>The original intention was for Perc Trax to be an outlet for my own music, where I would be in control of what gets released and when it would be released as I was tired of waiting 9-12 months for my first releases to come out. Soon after the first release I started receiving demos and it turned into a ‘real’ label. The main developments over the years have been the assembling of a close family of artists who are connected with the label rather than releasing a stream of one-off, unconnected 12’s and the label’s move into album releases which has been brewing for 3 or 4 years now but only really been a success since Sawf’s album and my own ‘Wicker &amp; Steel’ came out last year.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you go about sourcing artists to release on Perc Trax?</strong></p>\n<p>Sometimes I hear a release by an artist, especially one on a small label that might not give the release the promotion and exposure it deserves and really think they would fit on Perc Trax and of course friends send me demo tracks all the time. Other times it is from demos received by email but this is becoming increasingly rare, maybe one release a year is found like this. People need to realise that by sending trance or electro house demos to Perc Trax they are just wasting my time and making the chance of me hearing a gem from someone that understands the label even smaller. What they are doing is actually to be detriment of artists that might be suitable for Perc Trax and that really annoys me.</p>\n<p><strong>Despite having the foundations in place to release your own work, you have chosen to continue releasing productions with other labels such as Stroboscopic Artefacts and CLR. What is it that keeps you interested in working with other labels?</strong></p>\n<p>Each of these labels has a different aesthetic, musical philosophy and audience. Whilst there is a crossover between Perc Trax, CLR and Stroboscopic there are tracks I have done for one of these labels that would not work on the other two. I would count Lucy and Chris as friends of mine so it is good to work with people I know and mix it up a bit. Life would be very boring if I just released on Perc Trax without seeing what I could gain from working with other labels I respect.</p>\n<p><strong>Your album ‘Wicker and Steel’ has especially strong nods towards industrial influences, and some of the more down tempo tracks border on Musique Concréte in their approach. Are there any particular producers/musicians you would cite as a source of inspiration for these more left-field features on the album?</strong></p>\n<p>Hmmm, most of it still stems from the classic industrial artists, Throbbing Gristle, SPK, Cabaret Voltaire etc. During their more experimental, drawn-out tracks they all flirted with found sounds, news footage, drones etc. I do listen to a lot of Philip Glass and a little Terry Riley but I would not say I am that knowledgeable in this area of music. Coming back to current producers then Vatican Shadow and Pete Swanson are a big influence on me now, but that is pushing towards a more noise/drone sound than Musique Concrete in the classic sense.</p>\n<p><strong>I’ve read that during your musical upbringing there was at least to some extent, a conflict between electronic ‘dance’ music and rock or indie music. Do you see those early alternative rock influences to have a lasting effect on your productions or has electronic music completely won over?</strong></p>\n<p>No, there will always be a rock/guitar influence to what I do. It is more in the attitude and approach than me sampling guitars or trying to record full drum kits for my productions. I find a lot of modern techno too introspective when the rock music I listen has more attitude and is definitely projecting outwards to make an impression rather than looking inwards for answers.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think moving to London played a big role in the shaping of your sound?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, London is a continually evolving melting pot of styles and genres. The innovation the city continually displays cannot fail to inspire me and I think the clubbers in London are some of the most open minded on the planet. There are cities I can think of where as soon as you deviate from a steady 4/4 kick they stare at you like you are mad. In London they embrace these rhythmic variations and any new ideas you throw at them. That I something I absolutely love about London.</p>\n<p><strong>Would it be fair to say your music has a ‘cinematic’ quality to it, are films a big part of your life?</strong></p>\n<p>No really, I don’t watch many films. Maybe one or two a month at the most. That said I have mentioned it before the UK horror films such as Witchfinder General, The Wicker Man, the Hammer series etc that all play a big part in how I think about the more atmospheric side of my music.</p>\n<p><strong>Acts such as Blawan (including his side project Karenn), Gerry Read as well as the Joy O/Boddika partnership are doing a lot to turn the UK bass scene in the direction of dark house &amp; techno. As a long standing affiliate of the genre, what are your thoughts on this new brand of the genre, and is it built to last?</strong></p>\n<p>Of the artists you mention I love some of them and really dislike some of the others so for me I have mixed feelings. It is hard to think it will last when some of these artists have attempted to make an impact in 3 or 4 separate genres in the last few years but someone like Blawan is a massive thing for techno and especially UK techno and is someone who I think is in it for the long run and will continue to make fresh sounding, innovative records for years to come.</p>\n<img align=\"right\" alt=\"Perc\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8152/7697051164_7c47da1014_z.jpg\" width=\"315\"/>\n<p><strong>You have an upcoming tour in August, beginning with Berghain for the Krake festival. When Djing do you formulate any ideas for your sets before the night, or will you assess the vibe upon arrival?</strong></p>\n<p>I prepare for every gig a few days before the date but normally I don’t prepare in a certain way for the particular city, club or country I am going to. For festivals I might play slightly differently and therefore that needs different tracks for it to work. For the Krake festival I was playing an experimental live set so I built a completely new set from nothing with just a few elements of some of my Stellate tracks for Stroboscopic creeping in.</p>\n<p><strong>Berghain’s stringent door policy is fairly well known worldwide. As a British producer yourself what is your take on their dislike for tourists? Personally I think it’s good that they are making some effort to keep out those with little interest in the scene, but I think often it does more harm than good, and makes legitimate techno enthusiasts feel rejected and isolated from the scene.</strong></p>\n<p>I have never been to Berghain apart from the times I have played there and upstairs in the Panorama bar, so I have never had to run the gauntlet of the door staff, but if you fly across Europe to go to a club that you know you are not guaranteed to get in to then that is the risk you take. I am not sure if the door policy has ever been fully explained but there are people of all nationalities in Berghain every weekend, some who might be visiting for the weekend and others that have made Berlin their home, so I don’t know how it works really. As Surgeon has said it is the ‘no cameras’ policy that sets the tone in Berghain far more than the door policy.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you balance your time as a producer, DJ and label boss?</strong></p>\n<p>I just try and prioritise what needs to be done each day which normally means my own production work is the thing that sometimes does not happen, but it is ok. Perc Trax’s release schedule is slowly slowing down and I am stopping doing digital-only releases soon so that will free up more time for my production. As you may well know the bulk of any producer’s income is from Djing income so everything else has to fit around my </em><em>travelling and gigging.</p>\n<p><strong>And finally what can we expect to hear from you and your label in the future?</strong></p>\n<p>Next on the label is Truss’ ‘Ganymede’ 12” with remixes from Skirt and myself. After that will be a</em> <em>12” by a completely new artist that I can’t mention yet, there is also another EP coming soon from Mick Finesse which as mentioned above will be Perc Trax’s last digital-only release for a while. Outside of Perc Trax I have a 12” coming on Sleaze with remixes from Sawlin and Ben Sims and my ‘Work Softer’ track from 2008 </em><em>returns on Prosthetic Pressings with new mixes from Orphx and Desonanz. After there will be a pair of EP’s where I collaborate with other artists. One is with Adam X and the other I am keeping very quiet for now.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F16608360&show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>A long standing member of the Perc Trax cohort, Tom Russell better known as Truss has recently released his ‘Ganymede’ 12” through the London based label. The EP includes two original Truss productions, alongside two phenomenal remixes from Perc, and Birmingham based, Horizontal Ground affiliate Skirt. Following our interview with label boss Ali Wells aka Perc, we were given the opportunity to catch up with Truss ahead of the EP’s release.</p>\n<p>Alongside his relationship with Perc Trax, Truss has also spent time releasing with Ear To Ground, and Sigha’s Our Circula Sound imprint. Russell has also developed a fruitful relationship with co-producer ‘Donor’, having released a series of 12”s with the New Yorker.</p>\n<p><strong>You’ve released a significant amount of work through Ali Well’s ‘Perc Trax’. How did you first hook up with the label?</strong></p>\n<p>I just sent Ali an email with some tracks myself and Greg Donor had done. It was three tracks, and he was interested in signing them, and that was the Indifference EP,the first EP that we put out on Perc Trax, it just happened really easily like that.</p>\n<p><strong>So it was work with Donor that you put out first?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, we’d released an EP on Dumb Unit, and an EP on Synewave, so that was our third EP I think.</p>\n<p><strong>You have your next EP,  ‘Ganymede’  for Perc Trax following on from 2010’s ‘Osbasten’. How do you think your sound has developed since then?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s difficult for me to tell really, the Osbasten one I was messing about with a very swinging rhythm, and I tried to do the same for Ganymede but I think the track that’s telling of where my sound is and where its going is the track called ‘Hackney’ which is the B2 track. It’s a much more stripped down analogue type of sound. I think that’s definitely where my sounds at. I actually wrote Ganymede a couple of years ago, or at least the first version of it about three years ago.</p>\n<p><strong>So that would have been about before Osbasten?</strong></p>\n<p>Well actually I wrote it after Osbasten, but I gave it to Ali and I didn’t really give it to anyone else and he started playing it out a little bit. Then he asked me if I was up for doing a version of it for a release. I think he felt the mix I’d done was probably a bit rough, and so I went back to it and I accentuated the swing in the rhythm a bit. I quite like the UK sound, I hate to call it Bass music, but that sort of thing. I kind of like to think that in some way my music is quite influenced by that, so Osbasten and Ganymede definitely fall into that.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think its fair to say theres some strong grounding in 90s acid and techno?</strong></p>\n<p>Definitely. The stuff i’ve been doing lately is definitely grounded in fairly early 90s acid techno, yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>So was the 90’s rave culture a big part of your life? Did it influence the sound you have today?</strong></p>\n<p>It was huge yeah, the thing I got into first really was UK hardcore, and it was just through rave tapes back in I guess 1990 - 1991. Then the big thing for me was finding techno, there was a Carl Cox mix called ‘Carl Cox at big bang’ in 92 or 93. I guess you could describe that as hardcore techno as it was known back then. That’s had a massive impact on me and I feel that it has a particular impact on the music I make at the moment.</p>\n<p><strong>You have released several 12” collaboratively with New York based producer ‘Donor’. Whats the collaborative process like at such a distance?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s interesting because were not able to spend much time in the studio together, so we had to develop a way of working which enabled us to both have an input from a few thousand miles apart. We kind of fell into a system of working which we’ve stuck to ever since, and it usually involves him starting off the track and then i’ll finish it. It seems to have worked quite well so far.</p>\n<p><strong>And you’ve done some live shows with him as well right?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, I’m always uncomfortable with the word live, because I guess a proper live show would be full hardware, and we haven’t had any time to spend practicing it together so when we do do it, I’d say its semi-live. We’ve done a couple of shows together, and its something we’d like to do more of but its very difficult when we’ve both got full time jobs trying to co-ordinate it, so that either I can go over there, or he can come to Europe.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you have any more planned for the future?</strong></p>\n<p>We don’t at the moment no, I think its down to Greg at the moment because he’s really carrying on with his career. He works for Apple, so that's taking up most of his time. I think its a case of when he can find some time to come over to Europe for a few shows, but hopefully it’ll happen soon.</p>\n<p><strong>You have also released music under the aliases MPIA3 and Meibion. What do you feel separates your work under these monikers from your work as Truss?</strong></p>\n<p>Well Meibion was an alias which I haven’t really written and released anything for a while now, that was very much more my kind of anything goes from ambient-to-experimental-to-noise alias. I’ve done a couple of pieces recently which I’m quite happy with which might be getting released, but I think I’m going to write some more and see where it goes at the moment with that. MPIA3 is a project I started just over a year ago and I’ve been pretty surprised by the reaction that those tracks have been getting. That’s definitely more harking back to what I kind of cut my teeth on, acid techno from the 90’s. The production process which I use for that is very different from what I’ve been using for the past few years, Its very much a live take, just with outboard analogue gear. Its jamming with the machines and then hitting record and recording that, then that’ll be the track. Its a very spontaneous sort of thing, its really liberating having spent years of mouse button clicking, its a refreshing way of working.</p>\n<p><strong>As well as your own releases you have a rather lengthy back catalogue of remixes. Who has been your favourite artist to remix?</strong></p>\n<p>That is really tough. Remixing is a funny one, I kind of enjoy it, sometimes, but other times I’ll take it on and regret it. A lot of the time with remixing abstract dance music, it’s difficult to know where to begin. If there’s a hook, then it’s easy to base your remix around that. But a lot of the time, remixing dark techno, I find it quite a difficult thing to know where to take it, to make it something different whilst trying to keep it as a version of another track. I think there are so many techno remixes of techno records that are so unnecessary. So I don’t know if I have a favourite one (laughs). My favourite would tend to be one that has an obvious melody or hook, something you can hang your hat on. I’ve recently done a remix for these guys, Clouds. So that’s going to be released on Turbo Records in a few months’ time. I really enjoyed doing that because they sent me through a track and as soon as I heard it, I could hear what the hook was, and I got really excited about working on it. I knew that I could drastically change it and put my own sonic stamp on it. But with it being an obvious reworking of one of their tracks.</p>\n<p><strong>What are some your favourite tracks to play out at the moment?</strong></p>\n<p>Definitely Blawan. He’s a big inspiration to me at the moment. Another big record for me this year has been ‘Tapes’ by IUEKE, which came out on Antinote, a brand new Label from France.  Another one has been the EDMX record on a label called Power Vacuum. That’s a really brutally hard 90s-style hardcore techno tune.</p>\n<p><strong>And what can we expect to hear from you in the future?</strong></p>\n<p>This is the point where I’m never sure how much I can say (laughs). I’ve got another release coming up on James Sigha’s label, Our Circula Sound, and that will be dropping sometime in the next couple of months. Then there’s some more MPIA3 stuff, a couple of remixes and collaboration with my brother Tessela. Gig-wise, coming up there’s one I’m doing on a boat in Paris, then London, Berlin and also Venice with my brother.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F59005199&show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Cologne based dub-techno’ duo Salz have been making music since the tail end of ‘97, yet have remained relatively overlooked in comparison to fellow countrymen and dub enthusiasts Basic Channel, something that could be set to change with their latest and most definitive release so far, _Stainless Dub _on their label Telrae.</p>\n<p>As the title suggests, the music on this four track vinyl (consisting of two original cuts &amp; two remixes) is metallic, refined and seamless; the crisp hi-hats are interwoven with the underlying thrust of the plodding bassline, creating a bed for the subdued pads to fluctuate in timbre painting an uncluttered ethereal soundscape. There are all the hallmarks of dub-techno here, arpeggio pads sidechained to the swells of the bass, meandering rhythms and the stoically monotonous beat. However what lifts this record above its peers is what Salz <em>do</em> with these genre motifs, crafting a moving record of fluidity and space. The sonic architecture is lustrous and brilliant, allowing the pads to develop gradually and shift from one pattern to the next, formulating a brooding yet clear palette of sound.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the centrepiece of the release is the Van Bonn remix of the title track, offsetting the moody ambivalence of the EP perfectly, by imbuing the track with the vigour and visceral energy of a peak time stomper. The pads are reworked into a staccato rhythm and moulded into the rolling groove of the track while the compressed drums and builds of static capture the initial adrenalin rush of a club in motion. As it stands, Van Bonn’s edit is exemplary at tension/release letting the track simmer up to a boiling peak without exploding, and by doing so manages to add a distinct layer into the EP while remaining in harmony with the overarching dub aesthetic of the release.</p>\n<p>Indeed, with the recent proliferation of warehouse techno, it’s refreshing to hear an intricately crafted sonic journey into the deeper, atmospheric recesses of dance music. Although the EP doesn’t match the experimental peripheries of Basic Channel or the incorporation of different musical styles as on Deepchord’s latest offering _Sommer, _it’s in fact the uniformity of sound that is the record’s strength, creating a dynamic statement of vision that doesn’t get dragged down by endless delay trails, like so many of Salz’s contemporaries.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F59195548&show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Whilst many techno labels profess themselves as champions of diversity, Luca Mortellaro’s AKA Lucy’s ‘Stroboscopic Artefacts’ are one of the few techno-centric imprints that can genuinely consider themselves so. Comprised of a close knit community of Berlin based artists, SA have been putting out intricately crafted productions since late 2009. The four part Stellate series acts as a vessel for SA artists to indulge in their most far flung, experimental musings, each artist given a loose concept to interpret- resulting in two tracks per artist. The third in the series consists of contributions from Raster-Noton artist Kangding Ray, Max Loderbauer and Tobias Freund working as NSI, Xhin, and Reformed Faction. Mortellaro once enthused about the interplay between aesthetics and sound design, and this is none more apparent than on this record; released on clear 10” vinyl accompanied with limited artwork by Mortellaro’s brother, Ignazio. Like the music the art is minimal and abstract; composed of geometric lines against a stark metallic background, which is analogous to the music.</p>\n<p>The two musical reference points for the record are predominantly drone and ambient, which can often feel clichéd when applied to Techno, as a natural turning point away from dancefloor centric productions. However SA have managed to present these tracks with the vigour and conviction required to carry them off successfully.  This is helped by the fact that several of the contributing artists such as Kangding Ray and Reformed Faction have a strong background in these areas, helping to make the contributions feel organic and legitimate. Xhin has proclaimed the strong influence Aphex Twin has had on his productions before, although this influence is especially prominent through his two contributions to the penultimate Stellate 3.  Indeed glitching beats and warped piano samples isn’t the modus operandi for the Singaporean, the tracks having more in common with Warp luminaries Autechre than Xhin’s brand of incendiary broken techno. <em>As it Unfolds</em> paints the listener a bleak portrait of rainwashed streets and the unease of the city at night, resonating much deeper than the usual 4/4 fare.  Stellate 3 Occupies a hinterland halfway between the sculpted fizz of Raster Noton and the melancholic electroacoustic experimentation of Bedroom Community poster boy Ben Frost, inviting the listener to explore a world of musical glottal stops, shimmering strings, grating FX, humid pads and highly intricate sound design.</p>\n<p>Taking a holistic approach to sound design, the eight tracks presented here move beyond the template of ambient or drone encompassing elements of glitch as well as more regular dance floor fare. Tellingly the sound doesn’t allow itself to be tied down by sheer abstraction, the tracks flowing into one another, feeding into an overarching broken narrative. This doesn’t fit easy categorisation and is much more than your typical ‘ambient record on a techno label’.</p>\n<p>Far removed from the confines of the club, this is paranoid, stimulating and above all fascinating music for the early hours.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F58532658&show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Whilst Nick Sigsworth aka Klaus’ sound palate is to some extent comparable to that of his contemporaries such as James Blake, Mount Kimbie or Airhead, the South-London based producer has managed to remain decidedly unique. Mastering a fine balance between minimalism and textural depth, Sigsworth has as much in common with Tim Hecker or Fennesz as he does with the aforementioned producers. This tightrope balance between sample rich ambience and contemporary rhythms born out of the dubstep fallout, has had Sigsworth receiving support from his peers for some time now. This is somewhat surprising given his discography consisted (until now) of just one solo release and a handful of remixes.</p>\n<p>After a rather lengthy break since his last release, 2011’s Tusk EP, Sigsworth is back with a self-released 12” featuring two new productions, <em>Neph</em> and <em>Phi</em>. Whilst both tracks retain the same claustrophobic atmospheres of the R&amp;S released EP, they add an even deeper sense of isolation. Nostalgia drenched samples cagily hint at Sigworth’s influences and musical background, <em>Neph</em> building to a melancholic saxophone led finale, bringing to mind the array of jazz and soul showcased in Sigsworth’s 2011 boilerroom mix.</p>\n<p><em>Phi</em> on the other hand takes its cues from somewhere else entirely. Opening with a muffled ghostly choir, accompanied by a healthy lacing of vinyl static. Sigsworth then drastically offsets these choral wailings, introducing characteristically skeletal percussion, easing out resonances in the hits.</p>\n<p>Production’s from the Klaus moniker may be few and far between, however originality like this is certainly worth the wait.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2377154&show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Having debuted on R&amp;S Records, it may seem curious that Nick Sigsworth aka Klaus has decided to self release his second record. Devoid of any artwork or extensive press coverage, the 12” showcases Sigsworth’s tendency towards extreme minimalism, and crafting of atmospheric soundscapes. The record also makes up the first release for the London based producer’s newly established ‘Tanum Records’, an imprint that’s future intentions are as yet unknown.</p>\n<p>We were given the opportunity to talk about the relationship between imagery and music, working with R&amp;S and running 1-800 Dinosaur with Sigsworth, following our review of his fantastic Neph/Phi split release.</p>\n<p><strong>Having released your debut EP with R&amp;S, what was it that prompted you to self-release your own work?</strong></p>\n<p>I think curiosity, mainly. I wanted to understand the whole process of making a record, and getting it out there, from the inside. Working with R&amp;S was wicked, Andy and Dan are great people, really supportive, they did all the work to get that record out… but with this one I felt I should try the hassle out for myself, see a bit more of the belly of the machine. Get to know a bit more about the people still pushing records, people working hard, with invaluable skill, and support them directly along the way.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about the imprint? Do you see it as a vessel to release your own work, or do you have plans to release music from other artists as well?</strong></p>\n<p>There’s no plan really. I just hope I can get some more stuff finished and released; it’s hard to see beyond that at the moment. I don’t feel there’s any rush, if I could get another out within a year I would be happy. But I guess the basic idea is to put out 12”, 45rpm records, you know, no bullshit, no art, just one tune per side, cut as wide as possible. It’s certainly not just a vessel for my own music… I have no idea where it might go from here.</p>\n<p>**You don’t seem overly keen on branding or imagery. How do you see the relationship between artwork and music? **</p>\n<p>I don’t have anything against art in music on the most basic level - it’s necessary, and nice, to have some form of visual association when you’re digging through records. But I think there is a more widespread issue of visual distraction in music. I’m fortunate enough not to come into contact the most heinous examples of image branding, I’m happiest just ignoring that whole world, but you still see it seeping in, trickling down to the underground from the mainstream. For me, it only contaminates the experience, detracts from it.. just baggage. slick press shots of the guy who made this tune, when frankly, I couldn’t give a fuck. it’s nothing to do with the music, only ego. Leave that shit to the posers in magazines, in their little videos.</p>\n<p>It extends to going out too. I’m talking about lights and projectors and all this extra flashy shit. More often than not, it’s just a device to distract you from the piss poor soundsystem. But when I go out to listen to music, I want to shut my eyes down. It’s part of music’s escape value I think; you spend all day getting bombarded with mad amounts of visual stimuli, you go home or you go down Plastic People, listen to a record and enter a different sensory dimension. It’s relief, not to have to look at anything.</p>\n<p><strong>You made the decision to release exclusively on vinyl, is this something you feel especially crucial to your musical upbringing and how you value music?</strong></p>\n<p>I think all I have to say on this has been expressed more eloquently and articulately by others. But when you pick up a record somewhere, carry it home, set it down, watch it spin, navigate your way through it, learn its parts, batter it, hear that battering take its toll, remember what made you chase that record in the first place, think about all the times you’ve listened to it, about how your experience of it has changed as you’ve grown… a record is a solid reference point in space and time. Not endlessly duplicable floating data, but finite, mortal code. I dunno, there’s something comforting in that for me… and that’s what I want to offer people. I like knowing that I’ve actually handled each record I send out, imagining its fate… whether that’s being listened to and passed on, or moulding in a pile of Barbara Streisand albums somewhere…</p>\n<p>**Does your enthusiasm for vinyl derive from DJing or can you see yourself as a record consumer without this pastime? **</p>\n<p>I think my enthusiasm for vinyl is rooted in the listening process. Being in a dark room with some good speakers and paying full attention to a piece of music, no blinking screen, no progress bar, just a needle tracking across a record. Maybe it’s different for kids these days, but for me, that’s as good as it gets. For me, DJing is just about doing that with other people; it feels like a natural extension of what I do at home.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about the history of Neph and Phi? The tracks have been floating around for a while now, they were included in a mini-mix you posted on dubstepforum a few years ago.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah I started both those tunes in 2008… it takes me a long time to trust a tune. When I used to work on tunes years ago, I’d get excited about something, go away, come back and realise I wasn’t as into it as I’d thought … now I’m warier … hence the 4-year quarantine! Though that trust could just be familiarisation through endless repetition… I often wonder whether these tunes make sense to anyone else. Particularly rhythmically; I think I work in quite a subtractive way when it comes to rhythm, throwing a lot of elements together, then gradually removing them to see how little I can get away with… stripping it all back to a skeleton. I worry maybe they only make sense for me because I went through that process, heard them back when they had flesh.</p>\n<p><strong>Your music utilises a diverse range of samples; are these sounds you’ve recorded yourself or do you source them from elsewhere?</strong></p>\n<p>When I was at university, going to the library, I kept getting distracted by all the records they had in there, all sorts, I don’t think I ever saw anyone else touch them. I’d grab a pile and listen through and if there were bits I liked I’d hit record, come away with a wav file a couple hours long, chop it up and have no idea which record anything came from anymore. These days it’s a similar process, but at home… Other than that, films, sometimes just playing films without the picture, so that I’m properly listening. And also sounds I’ve recorded over the years on dictaphones… there’s a fair few of those in Phi actually. In a way, I think it often helps when I’ve forgotten exactly where a sound came from, it can take on a new life away from the context I first heard it in.</p>\n<p>**You help run the 1-800 Dinosaur events along **<strong>with James Blake, Rob McAndrews (aka Airhead), Ben Assiter and Dan Foat at Plastic People. Can you tell us a little bit about how the events came to be, and if you have any future plans for the night?</strong></p>\n<p>Dan was the driving force behind it really; we were all feeling that we wanted a focus, somewhere we could go with some regularity to play music together in the right environment, and Dan sorted it out, made it happen. I still can’t believe it, that I get to step into that booth, I’ve heard and learnt so much from the other side of the decks, from Mala, Kode9, Theo Parrish, Floating Points … I feel truly blessed. We all come at it from quite different angles musically, so it’s always interesting to see what course the evening takes. There’s no line-up or set times, we just get in there and see what happens.</p>\n<p>Next 1-800 Dinosaurs: 31<sup>st</sup> October, and 14<sup>th</sup> &amp; 28<sup>th</sup> November.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F31166234&show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

The EP’s musical references don’t end here however, including a further diversifying array of outlooks, from the dark, funk tinged musings of Magnetic Northwest’s mix of <em>Los Angeles</em>, to the droning electronica of Mannheim Rocket’s <em>Allegro Marcato</em>.</p>\n<p>Despite these varying perspectives, the EP is tied together by an enduring bruised textural approach, as if each track had been crudely stripped down to to its foundations, leaving only remnants of its integral structure. Mannheim Rocket’s take on <em>Stormcall</em> is a particular case in point, its warped slow motion groove constantly on the brink of disintegration. Testament to the strength of both artists production is the fact that none of the tracks featured feel in need of further expansion, showing that in this case the groundworks are solid enough to be left bare.</p>\n<p>Pick up a copy of the Magnetic Rocket’s EP for free over at the 3BS <a href=\"http://3bsrecords.bandcamp.com/album/magnetic-rockets\">bandcamp page</a>.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"360\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2631602&show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

No matter how much truth there may be in that statement, Thefft’s Distronet EP is one release it’d be hard to accuse of confining itself to identikit style house, taking a myriad of compositional approaches from the twitching funk of <em>Jungle Out There</em>, to the heaving tech-stabs of <em>Distronet</em>.</p>\n<p>The EP comes as the second offering from Fulcrum Records, an imprint headed in part by Manchester’s Sam Schorb aka Damu. It’s refreshing to hear a relatively new producer take such a playful approach to production. Especially in this climate where most dancefloor productions are tailored towards being played in moody faux-underground warehouse raves. The EP’s closer <em>TenTen</em> is a particular case in point, and whilst not the strongest cut on the EP it deserves kudos for its unique, lighthearted approach, underpinning bouyant jazz piano with shuffling garage-y drums, and the obligatory R&amp;B vocal chops to match.</p>\n<p>The funk vibes of Robertson’s <em>Jungle Out There</em> are reintroduced on the EP’s third track <em>This Way Down</em>, although the track is more atmospheric and brooding than the outright bravado of the EP’s opener. Regardless, both tracks feel linked due to their distinctly swung grooves, not to mention the fact that both tracks feature expertly spliced spoken word vocal cuts.</p>\n<p>Whatever Robertson’s next move may be, we hope it is as refreshing as Distronet.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2507434&show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>The recent torrent of interest in techno is a relatively new phenomenon, particularly in the UK where hitherto it has been overshadowed by dubstep (and the later bass music explosion). Since then the London party scene has been flooded with countless parties ostensibly showcasing the ‘harder’ strains of 4/4 dance music. Sadly most of these nights end up being cynical parodies of what they purport to do; playing instead watered down tech-house and what can loosely be termed as techno albeit of the lowest common denominator, played  to people who don’t know the difference or more worryingly so, don’t give a shit. Reassuringly, in a marketplace with these seemingly never-ending vistas of diluted musical offerings, enigmatic collective VOID have been catering to this need for no nonsense techno.</p>\n<p>Since their inaugural party at the sadly now defunct Public Life, VOID have gone from strength to strength, having played host to Berghain legend Ben Klock. With an upcoming party this Saturday with DVS1, MPIA3 &amp; Forward Strategy Group; VOID have satisfyingly managed to fill a niche within the London scene for underground techno. Not bad at all for a collective that was taking its initial steps at the start of last year.  Stray Landings had the chance to speak to founder, organiser and resident, Randolph Quan, who was more than happy to share a few words on the ideas behind VOID.</p>\n<p>Alongside Randolph, VOID is composed of a band of likeminded souls ranging from musicians and promoters to those of the bureaucratic and administrative persuasion, all passionate individuals dedicated to the music industry, with extensive and eclectic influences; indeed Jay Clarke also works as a graphic designer.  Talking to the founder, his dedication to music and the running of VOID clearly emerged, not so much using it as a platform to bolster his own career but to nurture that of others, while concomitantly throwing a great party. Initially pursuing a career in photography before opting for music,  Toronto native Randolph first discovered dance music when he emigrated to the UK, and began immersing himself in the vibrant party scene and discovering the abrasive sonic textures of imprints such as CLR and later Ostgut Ton.</p>\n<p>The influence of these formative years is apparent with VOID, where the aesthetic is strongly derived from the hard stripped down German variant, but remains firmly rooted in showcasing underground UK techno talent and ultimately giving the discerning clubber something other than the usual foreign big name billings. The desire to foster home-grown talent and “invest in the local community of artists”, while simultaneously shining a light on the UK’s burgeoning underground scene seems to be at the heart of VOID’s ethos.</p>\n<p>Throughout the chat, Randolph reiterated the emphasis on promoting <em>British</em> techno, with VOID as a platform for emerging artists like resident Jay Clarke, Billy Allen and duo Kontrol Room. The upcoming party see DVS1 doing his first headline set with no curfew, which will no doubt see him dig deep into his crate. So despite still being in its embryonic stage, the artists associated with VOID have already managed to make ripples in the local techno community; Clarke has seen his tracks played by the likes of Marcel Dettmann, and Allen not only has cut his teeth at superclub Fabric but runs his own imprint (Candela Rising) that focuses on intricate sound design and the outer reaches of electronic music. In a world of ephemeral and musically inconsistent club nights, VOID are a cut above the rest.</p>\n<p><em>Catch DVS1, Forward Strategy Group ,MPIA3 and all the VOID residents at Corsica Studios, <a href=\"http://www.residentadvisor.net/event.aspx?406683\">Saturday 10th November</a>.</em></p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Sepia! is someone who is very hard to keep track of. Forever uploading new music spanning all manner of different styles, it can often seem like Sepia! aka Theo Bennett, never feels completely comfortable in one musical model, like an impatient child frantically opening his Christmas presents. However, this is no bad thing, and as a result of his restlessness, his production skill has become all the more nuanced and intricate from each new exploration, understanding the subtleties of different genres and sounds.</p>\n<p>Don’t Go is a particularly impressive showcase of ideas hanging in the dark house end of the UK Bass spectrum. Mechanical clangs and churns drive the track forward, like the loud grinding of gears from a monster-truck. Vocal jitters and machine-like smacks overflow from one bar to the next, keeping the rhythmic feel ceaselessly uncertain and ambiguous. Nevertheless, the beat stays held strong by a kick so sturdy it would make Shed blush. The vocals pan across the field, making them an essential textural component, rather than as a sing-along hook. Which is good because a vocal line that was more melodic would most likely sound cheesy and would detract from the density of pulsating blasts that motor underneath.</p>\n<p>If you’re one for hearing fresh dance music coming out at breakneck pace, following Sepia! wouldn’t be a bad idea – check out his other experiments in garage, grime and dubstep to get a grasp of the virtuosity of Bennet’s production.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Henry Goury-Laffont, aka HGLDT may not be a name overtly familiar to most, although the producer’s history in fact stretches further back than a cursory glance might reveal. The Montreal based producer has shared vinyl space with both Damu and Resketch, and is the founder of the Swing &amp; Skip label. After a notable break, HGLDT has focused his attentions back to the production side of things, providing the eighth release of the Fullfridge series.</p>\n<p>The overarching appeal of the release lies in its strongly organic feel, Goury-Laffont eschews stock samples in favour of much more texturally rich sounds. The incessant percussion featured in opener <em>FightFlight</em> could well have been recorded with a live drummer, notably the hammering, tribal toms that are introduced roughly halfway through the track. The same could be said of the wide panned overhead percussion, snapping woodblocks and ringing rides cautiously drive the track forward.</p>\n<p>Both offerings take differing approaches, <em>FightFlight</em> would sound right at home in a big room setting, whilst <em>Lights</em> has a much more intimate and reflective vibe, droning synthesiser tones slowly build and reduce over vaguely Pangaea reminiscent percussion.</p>\n<p>The concluding track comes in the form of a remix of the initial track, from New York based trio Archie Pelago. The Pelago remix layers <em>FightFlight</em> in dissonance, taking it off the dancefloor, and into the psychedelic. There is something of Philip Glass in the repeating harmonies the group use, their acoustic interpretation of the track  complementing Goury-Laffont’s organic production.</p>\n<p>Grab a copy of the complete release over at <a href=\"http://www.fullfridgemusic.com/\">Fullfridge HQ</a>.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Outsider art, sometimes known as raw art is a phrase used to describe work created by artists considered as existing outside of regular society. Sonically at least, it’d be fair to say Andy Fairclough aka Cold Reader steers away from convention, his working methods more akin to that of a sound designer than a traditional producer.</p>\n<p>Outsider Techno is an ongoing project of Fairclough’s, gently mutating as different tracks are edited or replaced. Whether intentionally or not, this is an interesting concept in itself, as it rejects the idea that music should take a concrete form. As previously suggested the project is a foley rich experience; the samples used are left gritty and distorted, creating ominous unsettling textures that are maintained for the duration. The droning atmospheres found on <em>Taekwon Dub</em> or_ An Inappropriate Gesture of Thanks_ could easily be lifted from a Svarte Greiner EP, except they are mercilessly tamed by aggressive sidechaining.</p>\n<p>The warped bass sounds included on tracks such as _Purple Possum <em>or</em> Holding Pattern _ help to convey a distinctly UK rooted, urban sensibility, parallel to other British genres such as grime or dubstep. The blend of these sounds puts Fairclough in a similar musical headspace to Bristol based artists like Szare, Vessel or Kowton. The Szare comparison is particularly notable on opening track <em>Dissonance-Consonance</em>, which utilises dissonant atmospheres (as expected) with low-swung dub-techno rhythms.</p>\n<p>Outsider Techno is an unsettling experience, although curiously enticing at the same time, as expected of any good art existing outside of convention.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"410\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2694779&show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>After a prolific year of releases, including April’s stellar Crossed Paths, Shifted’s last release of 2012 sees him returning once again to Luke Slater’s Mote-Evolver imprint for four slabs of punishing granite edged techno. Throughout the twenty or so minutes that make up Razors the listener is plunged into a unforgiving sonic landscape that distorts and fizzes, the scuffed kickdrum acting as a lone anchor in stark contrast to the mayhem of the syncopated noise.</p>\n<p>Razors is not markedly different from Shifted’s previous output yet rather than this being to the EP’s detriment, it’s in fact the reassuringly familiar hallmarks of his productions that make this record stand head and shoulders above the current crop of releases that attempt to emulate pulsating German techno refracted through the industrialised Birmingham sound of the 1990’s. By welding the disparate ambient and industrial elements in the tracks with the relentless grind of the drum machines, Shifted manages to craft a record that is both unsettling and stimulating, without falling victim to abstraction or dull monotony - despite its repetition, all which is testament to his talent as a producer. Like Marcel Dettmann’s Iso release on Ostgut Ton, Razors’s sonic palette is grey, stripped down and visceral, but where the former is punctuated with brief moments of colour in the form of a vocal sample, the latter offers the listener no respite from the leaden skies and, barren soundworld of Razors. From the rattling and pummelling momentum of the eponymous opener, to the clicks and glitches of brooding closer <em>Trouble</em>, the record thunders from one incinerating peak to the next crafting a thoroughly uncompromising and menacing aural experience.</p>\n<p>With the combined duality of Shifted’s intricate sound design and the lethal drive of British techno, Razors solidifies his reputation as one of UK techno’s leading young lights.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F69796144\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Last month we had the pleasure of picking Randolph Quan’s brain about his stellar, nomadic techno night VOID. Following on from this, Void resident and talented producer Jay Clarke was kind enough to share his thoughts and musings on art, techno and porridge.</p>\n<p>He was also generous enough to deliver us a superb mix of functional, and exhilarating techno ahead of his appearance at Cafe 1001 for the Void New Years party, which you can expect to hear in the near future.</p>\n<p>**2012 has seen a resurgence in the harder industrial influenced edge of Techno, <strong><strong>with people like AnD, Blawan, and MPIA3 drawing heavily from the ‘Birmingham S</strong></strong>ound’. Your sound on the other hand seems to go for something groovier, ‘deeper’ ****and altogether more subtle. From a musical standpoint what are you primary ****influences and can you recall a definitive record or album that really captivated **<strong>you?</strong></p>\n<p>If you look at my productions then you might say I’ve had a big house influence and I’d prefer to go and watch someone like Levon Vincent over Surgeon. When actually my main Techno influences’ come from a background of harder Techno; people like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj6_3Eei0jE&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Hood, Mills</a>, Marco Carola (when he was running Zenit), Technasia, Dave Clarke and Ben Sims.</p>\n<p>They have all helped me a build a solid understanding of groove and funk which I would like to think translates into my productions. I would say I have been a fan of the ‘Birmingham sound’ for the last 5 years. For me I have always been drawn towards Surgeon’s and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R761r7w9UQo&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Female’s productions</a>!</p>\n<p>My musical inspiration is so varied that I don’t think it would be fair to pick one album or track which has captivated me in the last 10 years. I would say when I was 11 years old The Prodigy’s Fat of the Land album was a clear indication that I loved electronic music. Techno as a whole was captivating, it still is. It’s music made by machines, it’s raw and it makes me want to dance and lose myself.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://youtu.be/19ECq-4Bcm0\">Technasia - Acid Storm</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://youtu.be/lZ0v897fzy4\">Jeff Mills - Casa</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://youtu.be/HDElEIpa9Bg\">Jimmy Bo Horne - Spank</a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>**Does your work as a graphic designer affect the music you make? Do you find **<strong>there is an interplay between the visual arts and (your) music?</strong></p>\n<p>The creative process is always going to be similar; ideas, development and then creating the final piece, oh and then there is spending countless days afterwards seeking perfection. I find going to art exhibitions and watching films has a positive effect on my productions. Similarly when I am out of the studio and creating artwork I find myself listening to more experimental or alternative music to inspire my mind and let ideas form freely.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fy4YPd7viU\">Ben Frost - Theory Of Machines</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiwi7d0f91Y\">Oneohtrix Point Never - Replica</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nq4M7QBxt4\">Clark - Com Touch</a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In my mind there has always been a connection with music and art. I have always been inspired by Motion Graphics &amp; Animation. Studios such as onedotzero, Pleix, United Visual Artists, and <a href=\"http://www.antivj.com/desherence/index.htm\">Anti VJ</a> are just as important as my musical influences. The Anti VJ project below is a clear indication of how audio can help to create impact and suspense along with the building mapping. It’s brilliant!</p>\n<p>Music helps build suspense in a film or it can be used to empathise with a character. A scene of someone walking down a dark corridor can be made ten times scarier by the use of a sound with a long attack, the power or suggestion can be so powerful. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgx9nva_qss\">This video</a> is a great example of how important audio is in motion graphics to create music. It’s a beautiful piece of art.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you approach the music making process?</strong></p>\n<p>A bowl of porridge and a big mug of filter coffee and I’m away. I find jumping in the studio as soon as I wake up is my most productive time. I let my tracks form themselves. I prefer the freedom, if I like the sound I am creating then I ‘take it for a walk’ to see what I can do with it. I like the experimentation, the creative and scientific process. I like to get lost in sounds. We are all geeks deep down with cool haircuts. I still don’t have a set process, I like that. Sometimes I will open an operator (in Ableton) and create a sound and build a hook and build the rest of the track around it. Sometimes I will use samples and others I will create a track from the low end upwards. I like to keep things interesting when I am in the studio.</p>\n<p><strong>My first introduction to your music was hearing your track ‘<em>Entity</em>' which was played by everyone from Nihad Tule to Marcel Dettmann, consequently Were you surprised by the widespread support the track got?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. I didn’t initially like the track at first; it took me a while to really love it, I think it’s because I was living at home temporarily while I was moving to London in 2011 so I didn’t have a studio space set up nor time to appreciate it fully. So when I had heard Ben Klock played it at Berghain (twice, in one set) and then I heard it being played out at Cable in London I think It changed my perception of the track.</p>\n<p><strong>What records do you find are currently getting the most rewinds when you DJ?</strong></p>\n<p>Haha rewinds! That’s such a drum &amp; bass term… us techno producers/DJs have a beard to stroke don’t you know…</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCj-GAA_w4Q\">Ancient Methods vs Kareem - Zealots (Ancient Methods Interpretation)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccpRyPLOOq0\">Darqwan - Said The Spider (Surgeon Mix)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5B6JnmkqZQ\">Brendon Moeller - Adjust To The Fading Light (Ben Klock Remix)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UppwQE0oeqU\">Chris Page - Corpus Delicti (Blawan Remix)</a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>**Finally, can you tell us what to expect in the future from yourself and the **<strong>VOID crew?</strong></p>\n<p>Ah that would spoil the surprise now wouldn’t it?

    "content": "<p>The fifteenth mix on our series comes from Sydney based Mannheim Rocket, an artist we have written about previously following the release of his collaborative EP with Magnetic Northwest. Released on Mannheim Rocket’s own label 3BS Records, the EP tied the sounds of the burgeoning techno scene with more melodic flavours, something all too often lacking in the genre.</p>\n<p>The fact that Mannheim Rocket’s projects are often heavily melodically led is not surprising since the initial aim of the project was to bring contemporary classical music to a wider audience. The ensuing forty-seven minute mix he has concocted for us is reflective of this, featuring tracks from a variety of artists who seem to look for something more in a track than just its rhythmic elements.</p>\n<p>Look out for 3BS’ first release of 2013 in the near future, from Melbourne based artistic collective ‘Lost Few’.</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Djrum // Watermark [Second Drop]</li>\n<li>Area Forty_One // Coalescence [Delsin Records]</li>\n<li>Rrose x Bob Ostertag // Wack [Variation One]</li>\n<li>Sandwell District // Immolare [Soma]</li>\n<li>Kassem Mosse // Enoha [Non-Plus]</li>\n<li>Pearson Sound // Stifle [Hessle Audio]</li>\n<li>Surgeon // (Intro) (Version II) [Tresor]</li>\n<li>MagneticNW // Stormcall [Nivacords]</li>\n<li>Perc // Tension [Stroboscopic Artefacts]</li>\n<li>Robert Hood // Alpha [M-Plant]</li>\n<li>Mannheim Rocket // Vines [Unreleased]</li>\n<li>Ghost_ // Seqe [Ghost Music]</li>\n<li>Ricardo Villalobos // Dexter [Playhouse]</li>\n<li>Shackleton // The Branch Is Weak [Skull Disco]</li>\n<li>Pole // Jungs [~Scape~]</li>\n<li>Actress // Shadow From Tartarus [Honest Jons]</li>\n<li>Laurel Halo // Hour Logic [Hippos In Tanks]</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"denied:denied:denied:denied:denied:itpc://straylandings.jellycast.com/podcast/feed/2\">Subscribe in iTunes</a></p>\n",

Despite being around since the end of 2009 and being an offshoot of Berlin label Project: Mooncircle, Project Squared had slipped under my radar. I was delighted to have found a newish label putting out original UK techno, rather than just Berlin/Berghain derivatives or noncommittal tech-house. I picked up two Project Squared releases that day - the AnD release, along with Furreshu’s <em>Lucid</em>, and when the promo for Craig McWhinney’s debut 12” for the label dropped into our inbox I was pleased to discover that their quality control remains as stringent as ever. With just eight releases over three years, and over a year since the last one, <em>Make Your Mess</em> is a strong return, and to these ears is a continuation of the label’s slightly leftfield sound (notably a refusal to commit to the narrow confines of four-on-the-floor), whilst at the same time drawing on outside influences from other strains of techno.</p>\n<p>McWhinney’s music has primarily been released (digitally and physically) on Melbourne’s Haul Music, a label he co-runs with fellow producers and DJs Mike Collander and Christian Vance, and _Make Your Mess _draws on the more syncopation heavy aspects of his releases for Haul. Second track ‘Disengage’ sounds like a less abrasive Regis track, structurally reminding me of polyrhythmic live percussion. <em>Make Your Mess</em> has a greater sense of urgency, and is darker and more provocative than McWhinney’s previous productions, which have occasionally exhibited deep house tendencies, as on last year’s 12” for Melbourne Deepcast. However, there are strands of continuity. On _Make Your Mess _McWhinney may have jettisoned some of the more conciliatory aspects of his sound, but his ear for rhythmic intricacy has been carried across and tailored to the Project Squared template. ‘Provocation is an Excuse’ sounds like a depraved revision of ‘Flow’ from the Melbourne Deepcast release; and as such discloses McWhinney’s ability to translate a cogent aesthetic for the task at hand. The title ‘Provocation is an Excuse’ brings to mind the track titles of Dominick Fernow’s Vatican Shadow. While McWhinney’s scope may not extend to international violence and the military-industrial complex that Fernow takes as subject matter, McWhinney’s title is similarly evocative of conflict, and sonically <em>Make Your Mess</em> elicits images of war-ravaged terrain.</p>\n<p>The rest of the release has a similar air to it – an air thick with unease. However the title track is the lightest of the bunch, and as such is probably the track with the widest appeal. Each instance of the delay laden vocal sample which occurs just twice throughout the track has is like being caught off guard by an occasional passing car on a night drive. Entering into perception suddenly and passing by in a fleeting moment, it disappears out of sight, slowly enough to leave a trace, like fading rear lights remaining in view in the mirrors for a few seconds. The choice of timbres in the track (and across the release) is not unusual, although I found myself surprised by their arrangement. When the bass falls away three minutes in the effect is sobering yet disorientating, bringing all the components into view whilst at the same time leaving the listener unsettled by both the complexity and concomitant sudden clarity. The rumbling percussion and bass of ‘Disengage’ sounds like the far off marching of regimented troops heard through the soil, and the track is propelled forward by foghorn-esque synth stab which gives the track a dub-techno feel. As with the title track, the breakdown of ‘Disengage’ uproots and disorientates the listener in a whirlpool of hissing and swirling highs and mids, before the track emerges from the maelstrom as it reaches a restrained crescendo.</p>\n<p>After a year off for Project Squared in 2012 (although _Make Your Mess w_as originally scheduled to be released last year), this holds a lot of promise for the next eleven months and beyond; and I’m excited by the prospect of hearing how McWhinney applies himself to other labels in the future.</p>\n<p><em>Make Your Mess</em> will be released on February 18th.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F65483929\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Amalgamating gristly techno with raw, oddball house, the release suggests Jacobsen has devoted his time working on several different genre’s before resolving on the sound found in this EP.</p>\n<p>Tracks such as ‘Black Bile (Dog Star)’ or ‘Storyville (Too Young for The Devil)’ focus themselves on the fierce, rugged style of techno recently popularised by the likes of Blawan, Shifted or Clouds. Hound Scales’ grating, machine like percussion creates a brooding atmospheric undercurrent through the EP, despite the tracks remaining largely dancefloor functional.</p>\n<p>The same confrontational percussion is also to be found in the EP’s more melodically led cuts, which in my opinion withstand repeated listenings better than the purely rhythmic ones. Title track ‘Case (Nabis)’ feels partially indebted to someone like South London Ordnance through its incorporation of grime tinged bass lines and twisted vocals samples, yet stands apart with Jacobsen’s use of deeper house textures, and dusty rhythms. The last of Hound Scales originals  ’Surrender Dorothy’ returns to this approach, blending discordant bleeps with ominous blasts of distorted bass and jacking crumpled four to the floor beats.</p>\n<p>The three remixes that conclude the EP do more than justice to the originals, and do a good job of representing the diversity found in Hound Scales originals. Contributions come from Ghost On Tape, Isolated Lines &amp; Sheffield based Stray Landings favourite, The Weald, each exploiting their own niche through the remixes. Ghosts On Tape partially tames ‘Case (Nabis)’ with deep chimes, and a more regimented rhythmic structure. Isolated Lines and The Weald instead tilt their respective interpretations to more industrial tones; Isolated Lines take on ‘Stasis Flexi (Homme Plus) is dubby and atmospheric, whilst The Weald’s reduces the madness of ‘Black Bile (Dog Star)’, to a sinister, droning slab of Perc-style warehouse techno.</p>\n<p>All in all Case (Nabis) punches well above its weight both for the first release of Hound Scales, and incidentally the first release of the producers fledgling label - Fifth Wall.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F75030024\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.sleazerecordsuk.com/\">Sleaze Records</a>\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> 12”/Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 11/02/2013</p>\n<p>There is an air of anti-pretension about Glasgow’s thriving Techno label Sleaze Records. The artwork is simple and effective, and their release summaries both concise and accurate. It appears they feel no need to concoct overly indulgent concepts behind the tracks the artist probably had no idea of in the first place. The Mental Disorder EP from Barcelona based Sebastian Lopez, aka Flug fits perfectly in line with this, featuring two functional Flug originals, backed up with two fantastic remixes from Jonas Kopp and Techno veteran Audio Injecton, working under his Truncate moniker.</p>\n<p>Title track ‘Mental Disorder’ is dark and imposing, steadily paced blasts of kick drum pound along under slithering percussive rolls and filtered breathy pulses. It is testimony to the quality of the tracks simple foundations that Flug is able to stretch the track over eight minutes, introducing just enough variation to keep the listeners interested.</p>\n<p>Jonas Kopp’s remix delivers a more afront interpretation of Flug’s original, taming Flug’s off kilter percussion, instead leading the track with bumping mid range stabs and 808 claps, cutting through the dense atmospheres. The track is somehow transformed into a nail-biting peak time banger from what were fairly humble beginnings provided by Flug and the release is all the better for it.</p>\n<p>Kopp’s remix is interestingly closer to Flug’s ‘1K’, which deploys intrusive, screeching sirens alongside a staggered mechanical rhythm. Truncate’s aptly titled ‘Ghetto Jack’ remix of ‘1K’ steals the show however. Similar to Kopp’s remix Truncate provides a more invasive interpretation of the track, making use of jacking claps, accentuated by the infectious ‘check check check’ sample line. Truncate’s relentless output on remix duties is yet to become stale, and this is yet another example of how a simpler approach often brings more character to the table.</p>\n<p>Overall, The Mental Disorder EP promotes Techno that plays the long game; the tracks would be perfectly at home in extended seven hour Berghain style sets, due to their functionality, simple but effective grooves and lack of gimmicks. These are the exact traits that have kept Sleaze Records evolving since its inception in 2008, and as part of some kind of sonic manifesto for the label the Mental Disorder EP doesn’t stack up half bad.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F78823471\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

The respected profile of Mental Disorder is a testament to Rico’s talent as a producer, as it and its sub-labels have almost entirely been outlets for his own productions. Under his various alias Rico has also put out tracks on multifarious techno labels, including fellow Spaniard and occasional collaborator Oscar Mulero’s excellent Pole Recordings, Ben Sim’s Theory Recordings, and mainstay Planet Rhythm Records; which leads one to wonder what criteria (if any) Rico adheres to when deciding upon a vessel for his productions. The variation on <em>Passage</em> mean parts of it could be at home on each of the above imprints, and yet it feels entirely suited to Mental Disorder as each track bears Rico’s sonic stamp and thus marks a continuation of the distinctive sound he has cultivated on the label. <em>Passage</em> is a like a palimpsest, a re-configuration of territory Rico has trodden before, but with familiar elements laid down afresh. 17.1, for example, sounds like a reworking of last year’s ‘Segmento 2’. This is not to suggest that the Iberian musician is merely treading water; rather it displays a commitment to an idea and sound, and a desire to extract as much as possible from a certain assemblage of elements.</p>\n<p>According to his press release, Rico has a ‘passion for the darkest and sickest part of the human mind’ – quite the revelation. Whether that passion manifests itself here I’m not quite sure. A techno release on a label called Mental Disorder is never going to be the most cheerful or optimistic music in the world, but the mood is spacious and frosty, rather than claustrophobic and sinister. The name <em>‘Passage’</em> doesn’t give away much in regards to the content and concept behind the release, and the tracks are given numbers rather than names, which, forgive the cliché, suggests that Rico is intent on letting the music do the talking.</p>\n<p>The aforementioned 17.1, as well as marking a continuation of Rico’s own earlier ideas, also sounds similar to Function’s ‘Immolare’, with high pitched bleeps which in Function’s case sound entirely electronic but which on 17.1 sound more acoustic – almost like bell chimes. This similarity should not be surprising, as Function has previously done remix work for a release on Rico’s Evidence label. Moreover, as with most Sandwell District releases, these tracks are similarly atmospheric  - sound design is not secondary to rhythm.</p>\n<p>The sounds Reeko works with are often unusual. Whilst not wildly different from those conventionally deployed in techno, they are more natural sounding; like a more organic counterpart to the slick, metallic noises that are so familiar within the genre. On 17.3, the offbeat rustling could easily be irritating against the 4/4 backdrop; however again an icy atmosphere takes centre –stage, and so such brittle-textures feel appropriate. 17.4 is the highlight – at times it’s pure filth. A dirty, growling rumble underlies the entire track; re-contextualising the surrounding sounds and making them co-conspirators in this occasionally rough and grotty escapade. The Blawan-esque kick-drum is more prominent here than anywhere else on the release, although its effect, and the raw mood of the track more generally, is dampened by ambient synths which slowly rise in intensity. Even at its moodiest point, <em>Passage</em> exhibits Rico’s ability to combine ruggedness and beauty.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F71681450\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

The pair now residing in Berlin have been long standing affiliates of the label, so it seems fitting that they have been ingratiated as Stroboscopic mainstays by the release.</p>\n<p>The album strikes a midpoint between two of the labels most successful ventures, the raw, industrial techno frequented in the aforementioned Monad series, with the rich, ambient textures crafted over the labels recent ly concluded, four part Stellate series. Whilst at times the dark, aggressive textures constructed by the pair can verge on overbearing, the consistency at which they build and maintain the intensity through the album is impressive, and makes it hard to turn your attention elsewhere. Beat-led albums can often feel like a mixture of mediocrities interspersed with a few standout tracks, however the focus on <em>You Are Eternity</em> feels much more equally spread, and its attraction lies in its ability to stick together as a complete listening experience.</p>\n<p>Dadub’s droning atmospheres run relentlessly throughout the entirety of the album, overlaying each track, and blurring the lines between where each starts and finishes.There is an analogue warmth to these, as well as to the cavernous kicks and grating hi-hats frequented by the duo. Their gritty distortions and dubby echos add an organic quality, a feature often lacking in music existing within the experimental electronic bracket. I have read previously that Shackleton goes through individual drum samples altering their variables so they are all completely unique, and although the results are fairly imperceptible they contribute towards giving his productions a more humanistic feel to them. I can imagine a similar process has been taken through <em>You are Eternity</em>; the ferocious tribal rhythms used on tracks such as ‘Path’ or ‘Arrival’ feel as if they could have been recorded live.</p>\n<p>The Shackleton comparison is cemented more firmly by the spoken word samples that make up the basis of tracks such as ‘Vibration’, ‘Truth’ or ‘Death’. Often spoken word samples can feel overused of even cliché in the techno format (a trait parodied by Marc Houle on his track ‘Techno Vocals’), yet the album is so cinematic, in this case it would feel lacking without them; their use is sparse, atmospheric and subtle, rather than overly repetitive, or used as a cheap hook.</p>\n<p>The album manages to remain gimmick-less and overall incredibly dignified for the duration, even through manic percussive excursions such as ‘Transfer’. Occurring midway through the album, the track creates perhaps the most climactic point of <em>You Are Eternity</em>, with help from Ninja Tune affiliate King Cannibal, a producer no stranger to chaotic and distorted rhythms.</p>\n<p>Dadub’s inclusion of tracks like ‘Transfer’ or ‘Life’, are warranted all the more by the fact the pair have the maturity to use these tracks sparingly, making them all the more effective in doing so. <em>You Are Eternity</em> neither sells itself to the dancefloor nor waters down its content to some sort of easy-listening ‘background’ music, which is a bold move in itself.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F73386155\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

This cloning of fairly formulaic music currently inundating dancefloors is a trend severely lacking in inspiration, and has a staling effect on dance music in general. The appeal of WNCL has often come from the fact that its releases highlight how diverse house music can be, and as a bi-product of their willingness to experiment different textures, present a distinctly more engaging, characterful side to the genre.</p>\n<p>Although I can’t say I’ve found Bobby Champs’ output consistently life-changing (previous releases with Pictures Music and Hypercolour), his musics stylistic quirk and originality is commendable. This is certainly apparent from his first donation to WNCL, a four track EP entitled ‘Krenshaw’. Champs eschewing of bass-lines for almost the entirety of the release gives the ‘box-like’ drums he’s known for centre stage, and they are all the more jacking for being unburdened by sub melodies.</p>\n<p>Champs’ opening track, similar to WNCL’s ‘Get Lifted’, employs Dirty Harry-esque vocal samples, occasionally riding alongside the aforementioned signature Champs percussion. ‘Krenshaw’ employs a beat similar to his ‘Brooklyn Bomb,’ as the backdrop to the tastefully sparse snippets of vocal sample. Mid way through the track these are bound with silken waves of bright synth, a welcome addition that helps to accentuate Champs’ subtle percussive variations and added textures.</p>\n<p>‘Stanton Shuffle’ follows a more regimented fomula to ‘Krenshaw’, making use of wide panned, Basic Channel reminiscent dub-techno stabs. Swung rhythms reach a synth breakdown taking the track into darker territory, or as dark as Champs’ style will allow. It is Champs’ bumping house rhythms that prevent the track from feeling too ominous, as well the repeated ‘move your body back’ sample that appears towards the latter half of the track.</p>\n<p>Third track ‘City Boy’ follows a similar line, dancing a syncopated riff around bouncing rhythms and peripheral squeaks, similar to those found in the title track of Kevin McPhee’s ‘In Circles’, released on WNCL towards the latter half of last year.</p>\n<p>The final tracks success comes once again, from Champs’ ability to create infectious rhythm. ‘Bureau’ also makes use breathy atmosphere’s which are interspersed through the tracks various breaks, only to be cut short by Champs’ smacking percussion and oddball sound design.</p>\n<p>Needless to say Bob Bhamra aka WNCL’s decision to move the labels release phase to a string of 12” EPs is so far proving to be a good one, the ‘Krenshaw’ EP further cementing the label as one of the most interesting and unique imprints out there at the moment.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F76343425\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

After a relatively prolonged hiatus, the Berlin based producer offers up another satisfyingly chaotic three tracker, this time entitled the Submerged EP. Similarly to his debut, Submerged stands out for RKSS’ use of twisted melodies and heady, disorientating organic timbres. His approach to rhythm is refreshingly free, the patterns laid out over the EP are unbound by beat grids, giving them an unrestricted, improvisational quality, similar to that of Madteo or Kassem Mosse.</p>\n<p>Opener and title track ‘Submerged’ noisily stumbles along, loosely connecting grainy, bitcrushed percussion with the contorted synth riff the track centres around. This itself feels fairly unsettling, although as it manifests itself in the major key also feels oddly optimistic. The same juxtaposition is exploited through ‘Move’, which opens with a mangled assortment of chimes, punchy kicks and legato synths. Mid way through the track these elements slowly regiment themselves into a more purposeful order, the introduction of bassy, sidechained chords also help to introduce a more defined pace, and a sense of intent.</p>\n<p>Closer ‘Release is certainly the least chaotic of the three, and centres around RKSS’ enticingly rich atmospheres and loosely swung rhythms. A rainstick backdrop is set behind tremolo synths and echoing, Zomby style bleeps. Once again RKSS builds these to a peak around halfway through the track before giving way to housey stabs, coarse percussion and soft, intoxicating melodies.</p>\n<p>The consistency in style RKSS has managed to maintain through his two releases is impressive, especially considering there is a ten month separation between the two. How long it will take for RKSS’ next release we’re not sure, however given the musical sensibilities he has displayed so far, we are sure it’ll be worth the wait.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F3776377\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

The latest offering from the highly esteemed label comes in the form of a collaborative 12” from Sandwell District affiliate, Silent Servant, and Stroboscopic Artefacts founder Luca Mortellaro, aka Lucy. Pairing the two producers together is an interesting concept in itself, and highlights the crossovers shared between both, namely the production of deep and hypnotic, yet equally functional techno.</p>\n<p>Unsurpisingly, in brief this release is just that - a mixture of engrossingly rich soundscapes and pulsating, dancefloor ready rhythms. A-side ‘Dormancy Survivors’ combines buoyant synth swells, with low tribal toms. A grating, twisted melody is introduced midway through the track, as unsettling as it is captivating. This is gently filtered and interwoven with the existing delayed stabs and thundering percussion. It is testament to the textures constructed by the pair that the track remains so mesmerising for its thirteen minute duration.</p>\n<p>B-side 'Victors History' follows a similar path to the a-side, although feels significantly less optimistic. Cascading drums grapple with dense, foggy atmospheres as the track gradually intensifies over its ten minute duration. The track is interjected with pumping, industrial throbs, and echoing, subdued drones.</p>\n<p>For the first fruits of their collaboration the History Survivors display an impressively unique and refined sound palate, and suggests the pair could work incredibly well together on a longer, album format release. Whether Lucy and Silent Servant <em>do</em> have plans for further joints productions is unknown, however the History Survivors EP opens the door to something that could turn out to be rather special.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F80968731\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Over the last past eight months Brighton’s once thriving vinyl trade took a few painful blows, with the closing of the much loved Rounder Records after fourty six years of trading, as well as the demise of Edgeworld Records, a haven for all forms of leftfield music.</p>\n<p>Restoring the equilibrium however, Well Rounded Records openend their doors to their first batch of customers over the New Year period. In January we had the opportunity to chat with owner, and Well Rounded figurehead Ash Marlowe, as well as store assistants Dom Hughes (877 Records founder) and Chris Butler (Richta) about the opening of the new shop, and whats in store for Well Rounded as a whole over 2013.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: You posted a status from the Facebook page about the kind of excitement that you used to have about record shops when you were in your late-teens/early 20s and that you thought it was unrealistic to see that energy again, but I get a real sense that there is an increasing passion about record shops these days and this is reflected in the raise of vinyl sales. With the price of your vinyls, do you have an ideology about keeping it low, similar to say how Fugazi had a cap on how much their music would sell for this reason?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The only thought I’ve given to pricing was, well, there’s going to have to be a certain margin that we add on to the stuff we buy for to make it viable for us to sell the records at all. But you obviously keep that as low as possible so the retail price doesn’t become too high.</p>\n<p>With domestic UK labels or European labels, you can get them cheaper than say if you’re importing records from America and Holland for example. A lot of domestic records now are somewhere between £6.50-£8 and imports can sort of start around £8.50 and go around £10.50 very occasionally for certain labels. That’s a rough breakdown.</p>\n<p>Then there’s the second-hand stuff of course. To be perfectly honest, I’ve been putting in stuff that’s overspill from my own collection and every record that I’ve ever bought I’ve bought because I thought it was good or at least potentially interesting. We’re put second-hand records out in the shop after we assess their worth not just in money terms but also musically. We’re not putting anything out there that we don’t think is of a quality or standard, it hits it’s target whether it’s a dirty grime riddim based thing or a sort of dub-technoey thing from Berlin or something like that. Whether it’s a Villalobos record or if it’s a old garage record, we reacquaint ourselves with what it is.</p>\n<p>C: We listen to basically everything that comes into the shop.</p>\n<p>A: Yeah, so the prices for those, some of them will go out as cheap as £2 and we are selling a few that way which has been good to see. Things I’ve got at say a boot fair for a pound and I picked it because I could see it was clearly a vintage US house record just by looking at the labels and understanding what to look out for there, and then realising it had a couple of dubs by Murk or someone on the B-Side and thinking “Oh that might be good I’ll give it a punt.” We sold one recently that it was in that vein of New York garage-house from the early 90s. That sound has made a big resurgence through the clubs lately so it’s relevant to today again. I think, down south here anyway….</p>\n<p><strong>SL: So to what extent do you think that the shops popularity comes from your tastes specifically?</strong></p>\n<p>A: I can make an interesting point on this I think, which is that a lot of people were working at shops and then new genres evolved and they ignored them, and almost hated on them for as long as they could. I’m thinking of Dubstep in particular here.</p>\n<p>There were dance specialists in Brighton and a few of us, including Dom here, were aware of Dubstep coming in, and were getting what we could but there were limits to that – we couldn’t get labels like DMZ and stuff, and I would go into record shops saying to them; “look, there’s me and a load of other people round here who really want to get these records on these labels, these are the guys who distribute them blah blah blah, could you just consider…” and they didn’t get it. But eventually they had such a demand coming in off the street that they did what I told them to do several months earlier and creamed cash off a style they didn’t have any respect for. They barely knew what speed to fucking play it on, trust me. It was led by the enthusiasm of the people, not the shop.</p>\n<p>Because I’ve always been a punter and a fan and an avid collector, in my shop you’ll get that from behind the counter. I’m as excited about the new box of records as you are or should be, or I would hope you would be. The other day we had a couple of guys in when a particular box landed and it’s just a small shop, you know, but we had two guys there I was just like “oh hang on a minute we’ve just got a box, a few things here might interest you” and they each both bought a fresh, straight out the box, record that they had no advance notice of, and they also bought a record each that they selected for themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: It was quite refreshing the other day where you were playing some Juke and I think a lot of record shops don’t sell any Juke or if they do it’s in a tiny little bit. I mean, it’s not as if Well Rounded are known for Juke necessarily but it was refreshing to hear something so different to what you’d expect to be playing.</strong></p>\n<p>A: You’ll hear a Grace Jones album or a Prince album from time to time as well. The whole thing about it is, as broad as we can be, we’ll go there happily. I don’t put any barriers on it, personal taste wise, it’s all elevated to an equal status. Garage, Dubstep, House, Soul – once a certain thing has been achieved in any genre it deserves level respect really. I’m saying this because I’m coming to these realisations – anyone who buys a record now deserves a pat on the back.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: What about the label side of Well Rounded? Whats going on this year generally?</strong></p>\n<p>A: I’m carrying on with the three labels, the schedule stretches out quite far already, and there’s a lot of artists to fit in, I’m talking to lot of different people but we’re at different stages.</p>\n<p>I think we’ve got some fantastic music to put out this year of course. I’m also gonna be releasing more of our own producers, the actual family of people closely connected to Well Rounded, that have supported me or been there getting involved at different levels over the past three years or so. Chris works for the shop but will also release on the label as Richta.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: 877 have also released a remix by Donga &amp; Blake in the past?</strong></p>\n<p>D: Yeah, on the first release there was a remix of one of my tracks, and actually probably more interestingly coming up is a various artists ep called Well Rounded Rebel Alliance. As Ash said it features tracks from Well Rounded in-house producers and friends selcted by myself for 877.</p>\n<p>C: It goes off.</p>\n<p>A: Yeah there’s some dancefloor damage from Klic &amp; Riskotheque.</p>\n<p>D: And a much deeper sort of housey track from Donga &amp; Blake.</p>\n<p>A: There’s another tune that features Richta here an’ all. ‘Skeleton Grin’ is this kind of odd techno track. It’s got a spoken word vocal by me which was a stream of consciousness thing I just wrote down at the time in the studio, which seems to basically be about people that deliberately present themselves one way when their real agenda is something they hide.</p>\n<p>C: Unconsciously quoting William Burroughs.\n(Laughs)</p>\n<p>D: I guess to bring it back the scene in Brighton, there are obviously examples of us doing stuff together but I wouldn’t say there’s like a real strong scene like there might be in Bristol or somewhere like that. But with the shop and the labels, and us doing this EP and various other things like that hopefully we’ll be working more in that direction.</p>\n<p>A: I’m quite nervous about certain aspects of it, because the reason we don’t put loads of our own music out is because you think to yourself where does this fit in basically. Seems to me that a lot of stuff out there is quite conservative. I can only really speak for myself really, but I don’t go to make music with any idea about what we’re trying to do. I observe we’re just trying to find something to launch a creative process, and you never know what that’s going to be. So sometimes you’ll make a track but you’ll never make another one that sounds even remotely like it again. So that idea of there being like enough consistency to what you’re doing that you can almost ‘market’ yourself as an artist becomes really hard.\nEven putting one EP together - we’ve had to do a various artists EP and come up with The Well Rounded Rebel Alliance concept so that three things that were conceived separately but deliver a considered diversity can come together on one record.\nI mean it could be the best record of this year who the fuck knows. It’d be good to think that it might be. It might be the definitive statement and everyone just stops making music after that.\n(Laughs)\n<strong>SL: Is that similar to how the Cash Antics series works? Whats the breakdown with Well Rounded between the Housing Project and Well Rounded Individuals?</strong></p>\n<p>A: I can go into more depth about the individual remits of each, but to be honest I just wanted to get more records out. Its not gone too badly but its not necessarily advisable strategically. I think I’ve probably put a lot more records out in three years than other labels have achieved, but that comes at a certain price I think sometimes. You find records coming out a bit too close to one another sometimes with ones that are delayed too long. In the record manufacturing process it only takes one break in the communication chain or one thing to go wrong sometimes and you find your release put back a month or something. Sometimes you get a project that just for some reason becomes the weird project that got away, and you’re almost tearing your hear out thinking ‘We cut it four months ago, where’s the fucking record?’</p>\n<p>D: If your manufacturing vinyl, in my experience it never goes as straight forwardly as you’d like it to, there’s always a delay with something.</p>\n<p>A: There are exceptions but when the easier releases happen you’re just like ‘This one went nice and easy, thank god!’. But yeah it was just a way to be able to put more records out and I’m still pushing for that subtly. I work with distributors and I’ve found that there’s distributors that definitely see potential in what we do, and I think we’re regarded quite well. So we’re not without people that want to distribute our label, but at the same time there’s only so much freedom they can afford to give me, so sometimes I have to be a bit more creative, like this thing with me doing these WR Edits 250 white label editions, that’s effectively launching another outlet to get more of these tunes out.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F76016906\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>SL: Do you think artwork is important? What’s the concept behind the Well Rounded logo and labels?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The Well Rounded labels were something I asked a friend to do – I said I wanted something colourful and hand drawn, and I had something in mind that was a bit like an old Joe Gibb’s reggae label from Jamaica, but he just came up with what he came up with and I don’t know what it was that appealed to me about it, it’s weird.\nWith me there’s a lot of letting go and doing things instinctively, not over analysing certain aspects because I feel it’s boring – it’s more ‘why not, let’s go with that, fuck it’ than sitting around endlessly moving things round backwards and forwards to get the right precise fucking angle right – that wouldn’t have been something I was interested in.\nOnce we had the original label design, we just did a couple of slight deviations of the text on the first few releases. We hit Cash Antics 1 and we let Deadboy design that, gave him free reign to do what he wanted, and then when we came back with Donga &amp; Blake we started experimenting with the backdrop to the logo, and as we went on further we then stepped outside of that with Submerse where we adapted the logo and made it look like a Moving Shadow label as that label’s output had been a big influence on him.\nWe started to look at our identity and then the concept of the record, and play around with certain things. The Kidcut 10” is luridly orange, there’s an implied acidness to the way it’s presented – as it’s essentially a rave record. But then you have another release, where maybe the concept of the art was developed separately from the music, where our artist has done something physical with crude prints of the logo, like screwed it up and unraveled it or folded it over and unfolded it, or cut it up, photocopied it and taped it back together – things like that.</p>\n<p>The same chap also does Well Rounded Individuals, and on Individuals I guess for him it’s less about there having to be a particular link between the artwork and the record, but once again certain things have crept in, like there’ll be scribbles of pencil.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/8453313170/\" title=\"404944_332708633407906_1887474299_n by straylandings, on Flickr\" target=\"_blank\"><img align=\"right\" alt=\"404944_332708633407906_1887474299_n\" height=\"234\" src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8525/8453313170_8433d48273_m.jpg\" width=\"240\"/></a></p>\n<p>With Well Rounded Housing Project it’s a different design team – one of the guys who does it is a friend I’ve known for a while, I knew about his love of geometric shapes, intense technical illustrations – shapes, crystals, this that and the other and it was just something that we’d be babbling on about. I sometimes get from it a sense of locating a spiritual centre within the technical. There’s a lot of background to our daily lives that works in cycles, patterns and how things relate to each other. We are all our own planet in a sense….</p>\n<p><strong>SL: We were talking on the way here about the description of the label how that’s a really important part of whether you pick something up when you’re searching through a crate. At some shops they have these really lazy, wry descriptions of music that make them sound like they don’t care about what they’re selling at all. I saw a description the other day that said ‘the thing that all the hipsters went crazy for last year’ – why is anyone going to buy that if they read that?</strong></p>\n<p>A: I’ve found ways to deal with it, if you’re intelligent or creative enough you don’t have to lie. I’ve re-discovered phrases like ‘love it or hate it’. Certain records come out that you think that about, but you can still understand or appreciate what it is about it that’s drawing attention.</p>\n<p>C: You can be respectful even if it’s not to your personal taste. You can still write something on that label that appreciates what is good about it to the people that like it.</p>\n<p>A: We were doing some ordering the other night and I was showing Chris certain things. Some of those records would probably be records that would possibly be a bit more commercial or accessible, and you have to try and put yourself in the mindset of a young listener, a teenager – what would they think of this? What would I think of this? That’s just as important; not just being highbrow about it, don’t be snobbish about a record you’re stocking. You’re happy to take my money but-</p>\n<p>C: –you’re looking down your nose as you do it.</p>\n<p>A: I worked in a shop before this where staff put comments on labels like ‘ripping garage spuzz-punk’ or something. Somehow we ended up stocking a Franz Ferdinand album, and it took a while before I noticed that our description of their debut album said something like ‘complete fucking pile of total shit’. To be honest –</p>\n<p>C: -they were right.</p>\n<p>A: I was a bit like ‘well we probably shouldn’t be doing that’ but then again I see the writer’s frustration. I’ve had problems because I’ve always found that a lot of the music I’ve thought was really good was either overlooked or marginalized, and I think that’s always true. With bass music and contemporary dance music – often whoever is being the most loudly lauded you’ve already been following, and it gets a bit predictable like ‘well of course James Blake is fully singing now’, and it’s all become very ‘sit down at the Barbican’’. Fine, you know, I don’t care, because there are loads of new things – artists and people- emerging all the time. I think you can invest as much or as little into it as you want; I mean it’s there – there’s a lot going on right now.</p>\n<p>C: I think the thing is, however broad any individual’s taste is - and Ash has got extremely broad taste - there’s still going to be stuff that’s outside of that and you don’t want to rule out selling that in the shop, because if that’s what somebody else is into then we want to be able to give them what they’re after as well.</p>\n<p>A: Although I think I’ve just contradicted that a little bit, but yeah.</p>\n<p>C: Only because you’ve given Franz Ferdinand as a very extreme example…</p>\n<p>A: I think some producers go on a sort of trajectory as well; and it’s like OK, now you’re at this level, do you need my support as much as the guy at a lower level? If they’re still making music that challenges the stuff that you’ve appreciated in the past then you’re going to acknowledge that happily. But I just think sometimes it gets to a point where it takes on the shape of something that’s a lot more managed and promoted and actually marketed, rather than it just being underground music that’s filtering out into the natural network for it.</p>\n<p>C: To take your James Blake example – I remember hearing some of his early releases towards the end of the Dubstep days. I heard you play them Ash, and we all agreed that they were really fucking good, I personally don’t know much what his stuff sounds like since then. If he was to tomorrow release something that we agreed was a deservedly big release then we wouldn’t hesitate to get it in – it’s not like we write people off because they get recognition.</p>\n<p>A: No no no, but sometimes it does mutate into something that is so widely distributed that it doesn’t really need support from shops like us. \nI am looking at domestic labels, I’m discovering some and I double back their stuff if I think it’s good, even though people may not have heard of it until they come into the shop. It’s going to take us perhaps recommending it to them, like these two labels Shifted Focus and Blind Jack’s Journey, labels like this, where because they’re manufactured in England they don’t cost us a lot to buy. Even though we haven’t sold out of the first Blind Jack’s Journey release I’m still totally backing these labels. I hope we can help to promote this music because it strikes me that it’s exciting on some level. It peaks my interest.\n<em>Update: Since this interview Donga sold out of Blind Jacks Journey ‘Dream House 1.1’ and is now happily selling ‘1.2’. <br/></em>\n<br/>For some of the best wax in Brighton, visit ‘Well Rounded Vinyl Vendors’.\nMon-Sat 11:00-18:00 and Sunday 12:00-17:00.\nAbove Rare Kind Records, 1st Floor\nTrafalgar Street\nBN1 4ER</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F81673529\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>To the best of my knowledge, ‘C-Mine’ is Tarquin’s first collaboration with Neana (the first to have seen daylight at least), and it’s a partnership that given the solo efforts of each pair, sounds like an egalitarian balance. Tarquin’s bass-led house here interweaves slickly with Neana’s techno impulses, and the fruit of their labour is an (at times) busy and maximal powerhouse of a track. As a Stray Landings contributor and with tracks on both our compilations, Tarquin is a familiar face round these parts, but a little biographical detail is necessary for those as yet unacquainted with the versatile producer currently operating in Guildford. His crisp productions traverse house, garage, and techno; with each track allowing one style to take prominence although never fully discarding the others. He’s enjoyed some success recently with his ever-improving productions (well of course he has, he was on our most recent compilation after all…), with what was his most recent track to emerge on his Soundcloud ‘Hyperglycemia’ – a chunky tech-house number - being played out by names such as French Fries and Maribou State. East London-based Neana is a producer I’m less familiar with; but from following some of his output online he appears to have brought plenty to the collaboration, particularly an ear for sharp percussion.</p>\n<p>‘C-Mine’, as with ‘Hyperglycemia’, is unashamedly heavy. Whereas other tracks ostensibly following the same blueprint end up sounding crude and brash, ‘C-Mine’ also has an oddness to it that re-moulds its apparent aggression into a cantankerous oddball stew, reminiscent of releases on Untold’s Hemlock Recordings. An obvious comparison is the similarly foot-stomping work of a producer actually signed to Hemlock, Randomer. It’s a comparison that I hesitate to make as ‘C-Mine’ is more than just pastiche, but it’s an unavoidable one nonetheless - the squelching and thick synths of ‘C-Mine’ are clearly indebted to Randomer’s manic productions.</p>\n<p>With that inevitable nod towards Randomer’s influence out the way, there’s plenty more to get to grips with in the track. There’s quite the medley of sounds in ‘C-Mine’, ranging from what sounds like a dialing code to lysergic synth stabs; and thought it could all overwhelming but the sparsely placed kick-drum helps to open up space. The extended intro mutates several times, twice hinting at a drop but both times refraining, leaving you wondering what direction ‘C-Mine’ is going to take. When it does drop, this question isn’t fully resolved, and the track continues to surprise, especially with the unexpected instrumental break three minutes in. ‘C-Mine’ loud, and unescapably so; no matter what volume you listen to it at the airtight production leaps out at you, with each kick demanding your attention and snares juddering about like gunshots.  It may seem a trite thing to say, but as with a lot of dance music it doesn’t quite feel appropriate listening to it on a pair of bedroom monitors. That is not to say it doesn’t suit home listening; rather it has left me tantalized at the prospect of hearing it over a decent system and being physically assailed by it. Given the attention it has received since appearing online, it shouldn’t be a long wait.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F79380747\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

This news has to be all the better for Parisian duo Low Jack &amp; Qoso; their latest release for In Paradisium, is not just apt, but tailored towards big room warehouse parties.</p>\n<p>Low Jack’s offering for Delsin Records, the ‘Free Pyjamas EP’ felt steadily paced, but nothing in comparison to the funeral paced cuts found through ‘Like It Soft’. The title track itself clings onto the fruits of Low Jack’s Delsin release with tenacity, employing the same dry side sticks and penchant for contorted R&amp;B vocals. These vocals are the only element that could conceivably be considered ‘soft’ on the release; ominous, distorted kick drums pound throughout ‘Like It Soft’ and also make up the basis of Low Jack’s ‘Hats &amp; Cash’.</p>\n<p>A five and a half minute assault of slow motion industrial hits and abrasive, muffled foghorns, the track remains unrelentingly sluggish throughout. It would be an understatement to say the track had a hazy quality to it, ‘Hats &amp; Cash’ feels covered in a thick fog, through which its component parts struggle for centre stage.</p>\n<p>Qoso’s ‘Brandy’ is easily the most frenetic track on the release, but loses nothing in the ruggedness inherent in the EP’s other offerings. Making use of the sort of twisted kicks frequented by the likes of MPIA3, ‘Brandy’ builds steadily, before it finally succumbs to the dousing of reverb applied mid way through the track.</p>\n<p>Similarly to the ‘Free Pyjamas EP’, Low Jack &amp; Qoso’s ‘Like It Soft EP’ mediates an intriguing balance between House &amp; Techno, and as the press release suggests makes a good attempt at imposing the traits of industrial techno on a something not dissimilar to the hard house popular through the 1990s. Despite the fact that plenty of DJ’s will probably be reaching for the pitch control with the one (forgivably so), the 12” will no doubt be gaining plenty of support on the dancefloor.</p>\n<p>Pick up a copy via In Paradisium’s bandcamp <a href=\"http://inparadisum.bandcamp.com/album/like-it-soft\">here</a>.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F79813186\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Released via Seattle based imprint Nu Earth Kitchen, the EP amalgamates an array of typically oddball sounds into Ruzzon’s signature brand of abstract house.</p>\n<p>There is a sense of foreboding about opener ‘Laissez-Faire Couture’, dark paranoid dial tones slink between staggering rhythms. There is a hypnotic quality to Ruzzon’s grooves perhaps created by the fact that they never quite settle into a familiar pattern. Such rhythms are in theory similar to those of Kassem Mosse or Cupp Cave, but there is still an undeniably unique quality to how Ruzzon’s drums feel constantly just out of reach.</p>\n<p>The equally furtive, if slighlty less ominous ‘Mr Grecko’ makes use of degraded horn samples and sparse, stuttered percussion. As with Ruzzon’s inaugural release for Joy O &amp; Will Bankhead’s Hinge Finger, the track has as much in common with hip-hop as it does house music. Its leftfield beat-driven orientation wouldn’t sound out of place as some kind of bonus track on an early cLOUDDEAD album.</p>\n<p>The final three tracks centre around ‘We Doubt (You Can Make It)’, the original mix being placed alongside two remixes from Dresvn, and DJ Sotofett, a producer with whom Madteo has collaborated several times previously; their collaborative 12” ‘There’s Gotta Be A Way’ in particular gaining significant support as of late.</p>\n<p>The Madteo original is a pointed micro-house jam, vaguely reminiscent of the work of Jan Jelinek via its use of granular textures and early minimal style bass warbles. Undoubtably the most optimistic of the Madteo cuts, the track revolves around a disorientating spliced vocal sample which is put to varying degrees of use through the two ensuing remixes.</p>\n<p>DJ Sotofett’s remix puts an intricate melodic slant on the original, ringing of piano leading up to a crazed flute solo. Sotofett also manages to align Ruzzon’s off kilter rhythms into a more club friendly concoction, with thumping four to the floor kicks and shuffling hats. Sotofett’s interpretation couldn’t be further from Dresvn’s, which sinks deeper into the textures of the original, opiate chords joined by cavernous atmospherics, and ethereal melodies.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2444812\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

The latest offering comes from Argentinian techno veteran Jonas Kopp, and makes up his third release for the label. The ‘Desire EP’ is a pleasantly diverse release, showing as much a mastery of textural richness and raw musical ideas, as it does dancefloor functionality. It is perhaps proficiency with which he pulls off both these skills which makes the release such a satisfying bridge between house and techno, without feeling like a compromised version of either.</p>\n<p>There is a mysterious quality to title track ‘Desire’, faint vapourous atmospheres remain a constant, whilst distant low-pitched spoken word samples occasionally interject Kopp’s hypnotic, soporific melodies. There is a brittle, mechanical feel to the tracks biting rhythmic elements, a trademark feature of Kopp’s productions which endure throughout the EP.</p>\n<p>'Reject' is a much tougher affair, employing stiff tech stabs and awkward, faltering kick drums. The track works up to a hectic climax from fairly humble beginnings, doubling up on piercing claps and choppy hi-hats.</p>\n<p>Third track ‘Chaos’ employs a similar formula, although feels significantly less disciplined, and more inline with the groove laden, funk tinged techno of someone like Alden Tyrell or Chevel. Such an approach has been employed by Kopp previously, such as on the Deeply Rooted House released ‘Green Fingers’. Having said this ‘Chaos’ makes use of much darker tonality, and it is the marrying of   this with the track’s coarse grooves that make it so appealing. As the track progresses Kopp’s pulsing stabs are opened up with dousings of reverb and filter, whilst jagged rhythms stutter along underneath.</p>\n<p>The necessity of ‘Reject Outro’ on an EP which for the most part remains largely dancefloor functional is debatable, however the track does provide a fittingly reflective Oneohtrix Point Never-esque closer, giving some welcome breathing space from Kopp’s fantastically choppy rhythms.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F3948136\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Work Softer first surfaced back in 2008 as the scintillating b-side to Perc’s otherwise unremarkable Work Harder EP. The track is perhaps best known for Matador’s remix which injected a sense of space into the original’s claustrophobic and densely knitted sonic landscape.</p>\n<p>Five years on, this strain of Industrial Techno is the trend du jour, seemingly in an act of clairvoyance, Ali Wells’ Perc Trax (amongst others) were early exponents of the second wave of industrial flavoured techno, with the likes of Avian, Ancient Methods and the Perc Trax roster atop its crest. In a scene now saturated with an overwhelming glut of mediocre producers clamouring to stake their claim-with hypertensile but otherwise forgettable records, it’s understandably a measure of talent and modicum of hope, when a record stands out from the heaps of amorphous 12”. Work Softer Revisited is such a thing, consisting of three remixes – two by German/Canadian duo Desonanz, the other by Hands Productions affiliates, Orphx.</p>\n<p>Keeping in line with their modus operandi, experimental techno autuers Orphx kick proceedings off with their decidedly nasty rework. Channelling the relentless pulse of Techno through the darkly cerebral ambience of Industrial, the results is as visceral as it is imaginative. The mechanised elements in the track initially cloak the dancefloor elements, assailing the listener with pockets of digitised noise, tape hiss and what disconcertingly sounds like a power tool, until the fractured beats break into full gallop, tumultuous percussion overpowering crackling high end and ruined machinery.</p>\n<p>On the flipside, Desonanz submit Work Softer to their bellicose programming, constructing their interpretation around the looped discharges of static. The brutal sequencing of the track lends itself to the jackhammer thump of the beat- the pummelling midsection struggling for room against the unremitting electrical convulsions that threatens to derail the track’s momentum completely.</p>\n<p>Like the best music in the genre, Work Softer Revisited eschews tonality in favour of a complete sonic assault. It substitutes groove for relentlessness, harmony for discordance, and above all is violently dystopian, evocative of a scarily imaginable dehumanised future. Despite the monotonous nature of the music, repeat listens offer nuances imbedded in the tracks missed first time round, which again only serves to highlight the gulf in quality between Work Softer Revisited and the faceless records currently flooding the market.</p>\n<p>Work Softer is out now on Prosthetic Recordings.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F3758630\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

This won’t come as a surprise to those who’ve been keeping up with Nico Jacobsen’s music - the Brooklyn resident makes a unique form of uncompromising, degraded Techno, with an inspired knack for filling his tracks with strangely oscillating shapes &amp; a strongly individual character.</p>\n<p>The title track is a heated exchange between thumping kick and woodblock pattern, that’s fully primed for instant use in any hard techno set, it’s floor-ready &amp; ruthlessly efficient. The whole thing has a distinctly corroded atmosphere, like it’s the amplified death-spasms of some archaic clockwork mechanism. It’s got a more immediate payoff than its brother on the EP, ‘Dorian Hope’. Where that track overwhelms with its slowly creeping intensity, ‘Suction Clip’ finds Hound Scales content to simply power up his machines and let them run. In doing so, the track manages to reach that sublime plateau of Techno repetition, usually the reserve of more experienced producers. Around the halfway point brightly crunched up dubby chords enter, widening the tracks horizon; but soon they trip up, getting stuck on a single chord as if they have been tangled up in the clockwork – before running the track into the ground. It’s a clever structural idea that works to the tracks advantage, highlighting the muscular stomp of the drums so that their contours are in sharp focus.</p>\n<p>_‘_Dorian Hope’ starts as it means to go on, with a blast of harsh, whistling noise. The shifting drones are then artfully collaged on top of a mechanical, chugging rhythm that recalls the bustle &amp; clank of a subway. The track is built around a growing feeling of uneasy, inevitable doom which never lets up. A steadily encroaching bass line emerges out of the tunnel of noise, and later on there is the slightest impression of a melody trying to surface for air – but it never quite makes it. The dense, cloying atmospheres in the track makes it an interesting take on the standard industrial techno formula. It could fit nicely into a mix as a bridge away from the hard stuff; to thriftier, calmer pastures, while that weighty bass builds threateningly underneath.</p>\n<p>Aptly, ‘Suction Clip’ has been uploaded to YouTube alongside a torture scene from Shozin Fukuis’ nightmarish Japanese cyber-noir <em>Rubbers Lover</em>. The affinity this music has with the stranger side of cinema is clear: the soundscape is rich, textural and full of atmosphere, while the intentional weathering of the sounds recalls Fukuis’ use of black &amp; white film.</p>\n<p>This EP presents a fresh new take on the muddier, harder side of techno, vital at a time when a lot of the music being released feels like simply treading water. Both tracks are sewn together with an awkward swing that is fast becoming a Hound Scales trademark - off-the-grid &amp; so strongly committed to being so, that it can’t help but have a strangely effective groove. Both also build up and then undermine expectations in clever, subtle ways. This is alienating music which works well in any setting because of the care and attention with which its been built. While it’s only Jacobsen’s second release proper, he’s already showcasing a sound entirely his own, and this EP represents a promising continuation of that trajectory. I for one can’t wait to see what he comes up with next.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F74239655\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Listening to William Bennett’s two albums as Cut Hands is as visceral and consuming an experience as his explorations into harsh noise as Whitehouse, and transferring those qualities to a live performance has presented Bennett with a unique challenge, given the instrumentation used on record. Bennett sourced African percussive instruments, mostly Ghanaian, for the recordings; and so given that he performs the material solo, inevitably there’s going to be a lot of button pushing and sample triggering. Despite that challenge, the prospect of a Cut Hands performance had still been enough to convince me to shell out for a ticket. I hadn’t considered who the support might be, in fact I’m not even sure I clocked that the concert was being put on by excellent London promoters BleeD, so the discovery a week or so prior to it that Blackest Ever Black signees Dalhous would be opening was a cause for excitement. I came across Dalhous a few weeks before that discovery, unaware I had a ticket to see them and even unaware that they were the same outfit as Young Hunting, whose 2010 album <em>Attachment in a Child and the Subsequent Condition</em>, with its rich instrumental textures, had caught my attention at the time.</p>\n<p>Regardless of those foregoing admissions of blitheness, I went in with certain reasonable expectations about the performances and they were either met or joyfully confounded. Men standing behind laptops can be a little uninspiring performance-wise, so Dalhous’ set-up of analogue hardware was welcome (still not exactly like watching Hanatarash, granted) and provided an interesting visual diversion when not absorbed in the film footage projected next to the duo. The footage included images of mid to late 20th century Britain; and so coupled with the unsettling drones and beats emanating from the foregoing hardware, it recalled Mordant Music’s <em>Misinformation</em> – a film constructed from public information videos and accompanied by a specially composed soundtrack. As with that film, the music was well matched with the images, despite its anachronistic quality. Dialogue from the footage was left in, and combined with the noisy (maddeningly so) chatter of the audience it created some sinister moments, as screams of horror from the films became engulfed in the crowd noise and sounded as if they were coming from within the room. The Edinburgh-based duo make dense, morose, beat driven music, traversing a variety of tempos and often sounding awfully similar to another Blackest Ever Black duo, Raime. On record Dalhous have an airer feel that Raime, as well as incorporating a greater diversity of sounds; but the comparison is hard to avoid and the increased decibels of the performance made the music sound more unsettling and darker, and thus closer to that of the London pair’s. Interestingly, there were moments which reminded me of parts of the more ambient moments from the most recent Cut Hands LP, <em>Black Mamba</em>, which recall the psychedelic atmospheres of Popol Vuh, but with drones and percussion that have a darker feel than the German band, and so sit well with both artists’ association with Blackest Ever Black.</p>\n<p>Despite the frenzied quality of his music, William Bennett’s performance was constrained by the aforementioned hindrance of being performed in part on a laptop, and ultimately he is fighting a losing battle trying to transfer the energy and mood of the recordings to live settings. An East London café isn’t exactly the terrain that the music brings to mind, but that isn’t to suggest the performance wasn’t engaging, intense, and vivacious. As with Dalhous, the music was accompanied by visuals, with a medley of imagery ranging from skulls and primitive drawings, computer imagery, and the cosmic. Such diverse reference points run the risk of creating a meaningless slew of signifiers, but as with the music, which combines influences and elements from wildly divergent sources, the result was a collection of foraged signs which called into question the cultural identity of the music. Bennett’s Cut Hands projects refuses to be tied to any location or style; and combines influences and elements from wildly divergent sources – ritualistic percussion, electronic grooves, and power electronics, to names a few. Even at its harshest moments which draw from that aforementioned influence of power electronics, the Cut Hands material never comes close to extreme frequencies or volume of Whitehouse, although occasionally members of the audience were forced to cover their ears, apparently in pain. The physicality of the music still seeped through, with the occasional flailing body part in the audience despite the serene surroundings - a reminder that this is Bennett’s take on body music. The static reactions of much of the crowd indicated that it’s not interpreted that way by all, as it presents a break from conventional Western electronic dance music, but it’s in no way any less compelling.</p>\n",

The press release for the EP places Developer amongst the ‘re-surfacing and growing rise of American Techno’ and we are very much inclined to agree. But with the likes of Function, Audio Injection (Truncate) and DVS1 flying the flag for high quality state side Techno, it is no small task to stand up and be counted among them. However Developer’s ability to create beautifully wonky and melodic music whilst maintaining a firm focus on the dance floor is what really stands him apart from the fairly traditional, minimalist infused stylings of his contemporaries. His abilities as a producer have been tested much like his counterparts across the US, in a long battle for the music to stay alive and healthy, in the face of one of the toughest terrains for dance music in the world. With nearly two decades of promotion, label building, DJing and producing to his name it is no wonder that someone like Developer is able to release such consistently mesmerising dance music at such a high rate.</p>\n<p>Kicking off with ‘The Galaxian’ Developer sets a tone of familiarly rugged, loop driven Techno, which does exactly what it says on the tin. ‘Moments of Clarity’ ramps up the energy adding textural maturity along with a strong, almost monolithic chord line. There are few cheap filter sweeps to be found here, instead the chords pummel the listener, whilst the bass line chugs along, interspersed with piercingly clear percussive variations. ‘Run for the Dark’ is again a fairly standard workout, being both short and sweet. Although, the vocal sample feels at times a bit derivative, with the creative quality of some of the other tracks being so high, it leaves this moment feeling slightly lazy. In a word, it is rather monotonous, definitely representing the weakest track on the release.</p>\n<p>Ultimately the real gems on the EP are ‘Reaching’ and ‘Ursae Majoris’. Here Developer mangles the expectations of the listener, providing both a rhythmic and melodic uniqueness that is rarely heard in the genre. ‘Reaching’ is the more familiar of the two, characterized by an off kilter chord pattern, which slinks its way through as the backbone of the track, occasionally being complimented by flittering alterations in hi-hat patterns across its refreshingly short four minutes. ‘Ursae Majoris’ on the other hand is like nothing I’ve heard before, it is a truly outstanding track and is certainly the most interesting piece of Techno to arrive in our inbox this year. The rhythmic foundations are of course familiar, with brutal kick drums and crisp hi-hats, but it is the amorphous, atonal melodic structure which drifts throughout the track that is so intriguing. It is neither dark nor bright, and is somehow wonderfully melancholic. It sounds as if the record itself is completely warped, or being sped up and slowed down by an unwitting child, driven to the task by sheer boredom, and it sounds fantastic for it. It creates a brilliant ambiguity in mood, at times it is totally hypnotic and at others it almost feels like a prank. To see the reaction of a crowd on a packed dance floor would really be something to behold!</p>\n<p>It is hard to fathom however how Modularz arrived with the given artwork for a release that is for the most part, a fairly dignified offering to the Techno community. We’ve made a point of highlighting sexism within the dance music community before, and it seems a shame that the Archive sleeves feel the need to resort to using female nudity, when they would probably sell just as well without.</p>\n<p>This aside, the EP is very much consistent with the previous output in the Archive series, despite being often less dark and certainly more interesting. Some of the more familiar elements will work well for their intended uses on the dance floor. There is no shame in that, but when confronted with a track like ‘Ursae Majoris’, you can’t help but think Developer’s talents lie far beyond the admitted functionalism that is talked about in the press releases. There can, and often is a real musical creativity in his work, and its screams out to be explored more, in either an extended EP, or album format release.</p>\n<p>Well, one can dream…</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F83187422\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Despite setting up his own label, ‘Vault Series’, Berlin-based producer Subjected has remained somewhat an enigma. We know little about him other than through his music, which has included notable collaborations with Sawlin, and split EPs with Moerbeck. ‘Zero’ is his debut full-length release and a powerful one to say the least.</p>\n<p>The album gets off to an appropriately disquieting start, with cinematic explosions and rumbles - a kind of gunshot to signal the start of what is truly a relentless marathon of thuds and crashes. Indeed, if there were one word to describe this album, it would be that: relentless.</p>\n<p>The main bulk of ‘Zero’ is made up of distorted, metallic crunches that fight for room in the mix above the colossal kick sounds that penetrate each track. That isn’t to say the production on the album is bad – quite to the contrary, Subjected uses the enormous presence of the kicks as a stylistic technique to create a sense of claustrophobia and headiness. As each satisfying cacophony builds throughout the album, adrenaline levels rise and conclude with what will doubtless be one of the most severe Techno tracks of 2013, ‘SD1’. Even the EQs and overdrive levels on this album push further than most would dare to venture, permeating the skull in a way that is pleasing for many, but not all. I certainly wouldn’t recommend this album for anyone not up to a challenge.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the album has some soulful moments, too. ‘Concept’, a personal highlight, showcases Subjected’s ability to provide feeling and delicacy amidst the heaviness, with a subtle interweaving of textures that overlap one another seamlessly.  There’s also a refreshing ending to this album; ‘The Throne’ is a down-tempo afterthought with heavy nods to early Aphex Twin, and closes the album on a surprisingly reflective note.</p>\n<p>In spite of these interludes, you may want to give your ears a rest after listening all the way through because it is very dense indeed, and could be criticized for focusing too much on ‘going harder’ rather than on sonic variation. However, I don’t think Subjected is necessarily trying to do that here, and this album is immensely enjoyable at points, particularly when the sounds are the hardest. The truth is, Subjected can work an infectious rhythm, and structure gigantic dynamic shifts despite the harshness of the sounds he’s working with. For anyone who wants a master class in the interface between noise and techno, starting here wouldn’t be a bad move.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F4340799\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Structurally, both the originals suggest he has a strong awareness of where his music fits, and the patience with which he develops each, makes the payoffs all the more satisfying.</p>\n<p>Opener, ‘Counterfeit Innovator’ is a tastefully restrained big-room jam, utilising subtle atmospherics, alongside a repetitive, gnarled synth-line. Page’s twisted hook slowly mutates as the track progresses, underpinned by a chugging rhythmic undercurrent. The tracks beatific elements are minimal yet effective, slightly off-grid hats solidified by sullen, stomping kicks.</p>\n<p>The original is barely recognisable through Chris Finke’s take on the track, shaking free of the original’s malignant synth-line in favour of ’90s minimal indebted stylings. Incessant drums are driven by piercing high end, quantising Page’s originally fairly free, swung hats. The original’s distorted riff is replaced with a frantic melody, helping complement Finke’s beatific variations, and heightening the tracks claustrophobic atmosphere.</p>\n<p>The b-side offerings take a more direct approach to ‘Counterfeit Innovator’ and its equivalent remix, and are generally more instantly gratifying. This isn’t to say that they lack in the sonic subtlety of the a-side, but the builds are less drawn-out, and the rhythms feel weightier and more defined. ‘Corpus Delicti’ deploys low pitched vocals alongside swarming hats and a modulated bass-line, swelling between Page’s pounding four to the floor kicks.</p>\n<p>Comparatively, Jamie Roberts’ (aka Blawan’s) interpretation of ‘Corpus Delicti’ remains truer to the original than Finke’s rework of ‘Counterfeit Innovator’, albeit by a small margin. Whilst keeping a firm grip on Page’s gristled bass, Roberts reconstructs the track’s percussive elements into a frenetic, clattering mess. Similarly to Finke’s remix, Roberts also straightens out the original’s steady groove, taking a more confrontational approach.</p>\n<p>Corpus Delicti may only be Page’s fourth release to date, yet proves his prowess as a producer extends far beyond what this short discography may suggest.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2758854&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

This will be our third review of his music since he first caught our attention, and it’s well deserved. Cassman has an almost unrivalled consistency as a producer, as well as notoriety as a DJ, etching his way further up the bills of Brighton’s Aka Aka Roar line-ups – a night which I hope to see Cassman headline soon enough.</p>\n<p>“Have I Told You” opens the EP with immense intrigue. The block hits and rides groove in an infectious manner, making it near impossible not to move with them or tune them out. These are subtly overlaid by the kind of vocals that have become Cassman’s signature. It’s rare to see a producer have a trademark musical motif that can be instantly identifiable, but his vocal work is distinctly subdued in character, and is always tastefully refined from the excessive repetition and sleek cutting style that is so prominent in the likes of Disclosure et al. Similarly, ‘Searching’ manages to strike a perfect balance between robust rhythms and delicate ambience, as frosty pink noise harmonies, hover above a bellowing sub bass - a combination that would allow it to translate just as well to headphones as to a club system. There’s also an interesting remix from Citizen, and although it’s often nice to get a variation of artists on an EP, I feel as if this particular addition is unnecessary, since it doesn’t exhibit as much technical expertise or dynamic nuance as the rest. However, it is arguably more club-friendly than the others, so perhaps a welcome inclusion.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, it’s ‘Giant Stars’ that is my firm favorite, and it’s nice to see that it’s finally materialized on to an actual EP given that it’s been floating around the blogosphere for well over a year now. Indeed, ‘Giant Stars’ was the track that first focused our attention to his work, all the way back in <a href=\"http://www.straylandings.co.uk/post/9553436023/giant-star-lorca\">2011</a>. It’s reassuring to know it doesn’t sound dated or passé despite it’s age, and to the contrary, Lorca’s music has an almost ‘classic’ sound to it, one that could permeate even the most stubborn of musical tastes.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F4465524\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

The latest of these, Tempered Inmid, cements Letellier as a Stroboscopic regular, his brand of highly experimental mechanistic Techno fitting in neatly with the labels refined aesthetics.</p>\n<p>A combination of icy, machine like rhythms and emotive, futurist synth work is at play through Tempered Inmid. Letellier’s glacial melodies provide a stark contrast to the abrasive glitching rhythms through the EP. Title track ‘Tempered Inmid’ is a good testimony to this, mixing gristly, throbbing arpeggios with relentless muscular kicks  and extraneous ticks and taps.</p>\n<p>There is an apparent, near obsessive level of attention to detail applied to the release, which is perhaps a hallmark of Letellier’s work with Raster Noton. The percussion through ‘Nuis Octury’ in particular is reminiscent of that of Raster Noton co-founder Carsten Nicolai (Alva Noto), through its incorporation of static atmospheres and precisely programmed rhythms, albiet in a slightly more danceable incarnation.</p>\n<p>Whilst ‘Nuis Octury’ is by far the most kinetic offering on the EP, Tempered Inmid feels for the most part, decidedly introspective. Rhythmic elements take a back seat through ‘Dimen Andesso’, instead being led by the beautiful, subdued analogue melodies Letellier exhibited on his contributions to the excellent Stellate 3. Closer ‘Ezerb Altren’ has a similarly woeful undercurrent created by Letellier’s droning chord progressions. The track has a hauntingly slow pace to it, and a sense of being submerged.</p>\n<p>With Stroboscopic’s Stellate series concluded with the fourth edition, its nice to see the labels pursuit of experimental music continuing, and equally satisfying to see Kangding Ray’s output fitting in so neatly.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F84030599\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

These experiences have had an undoubtable effect on Finke’s music; the structure of each four tracks of Don’t Try This At Home feels carefully considered, creating narratives with apparent ease.</p>\n<p>Opener and title track ‘Don’t Try This At Home’ sets a production standard and a close-knit percussive structure which endures for the duration of the EP. Cymbals scrape alongside skittering hats and crunchy hits, cemented by Finke’s thickset kick drums. The most captivating ingredient of ‘Don’t Try This At Home’ however, has to be Finke’s grating synth-work, a trait rightfully exploited through Black Asteroid’s volatile remix.</p>\n<p>Opening with an earsplitting measure of noise, Black Asteroid’s remix is a cacophonous battering from start to finish. Finke’s aforementioned synth chords are modulated to the extreme, wide-panning across the mix over frantic rhythms, and the occasional blast of noise.</p>\n<p>Decidedly the most House orientated of the EP’s four offerings, ‘Cala Vadella’ is owner to one of the most infectious bass grooves i’ve ever encountered. Loosely following Finke’s hammering kick drums, this funk-inflected riff endures for the entirety of the track, brought to the fore from its rather timid, filtered beginnings. Midway through the track Finke’s simple but effective formula is joined by pointed stabs, punctuating ‘Cala Vadella’s dense groove on the offbeat.</p>\n<p>The assorted elements of aptly titled closer ‘Warehouse Syndrome’ are rigorously clamped to Finke’s compact rhythms - atmospherics are also mercilessly sidechained to thunderous kicks. A startlingly abrupt siren breaks the trance created by Finke’s hypnotic rhythms around a minute and a half in, signifying a significant increase in intensity.</p>\n<p>Similarly to his offerings to last year’s Parallel Series 3 for Mote-Evolver, it is the sense of energy created by his vivacious grooves that really set the tracks on this EP apart from those of his contemporaries, and I for one hope this isn’t a trait Finke will be dropping anytime soon.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F3665023\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Lineup: Terry Francis, Rrose [Live], Regis &amp; James Ruskin<br>\nVenue: Fabric, London<br>\nDate: 20/04/13</p>\n<p>At the apex of their success in 2011, Karl O’Connor &amp; Dave Sumner decided to pull the plug on their label/collective Sandwell District, before it became assimilated into the mainstream; before it became tedious and before exhausted its originality. Since the label/not label’s birth in 2002 (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=3bll2UxwUjE#t=150s\">the label tag is something O’Connor is a little ambiguous about</a>), Sandwell District helped to define the Techno landscape of the noughties - a menacing, abstract, streamlined sound owing as much to the DIY aesthetic of 80s Industrial, as to billowing warehouse Techno. Fast forward to 2013, and we find ourselves queuing outside Fabric for the launch party of their mix CD, with a live set from Rrose to look forward to alongside Sandwell District’s headline slot, and resident Terry Francis playing a warm up set.</p>\n<p>Partying at any of London’s major clubs tends to come at a certain expense - with the recent endemic of belligerent snapback sporting morons, we’ve tended to shy away from the larger clubs in recent years. Fabric in particular appears to attract most of the punters by its name alone. However if one thing was to tempt us out of the woodwork, it’d be the reformation of the Sandwell District collective, and in truth, there couldn’t be a much more fitting setting for the Sandwell sound that Fabric’s cavernous network of underground tunnels.</p>\n<p>On entry, I couldn’t help but think Berghain’s seemingly arbitrary door policy is that bit more understandable, when confronted with a huddle of boisterous, chanting football fans, and a frenzied individual who appeared to have paid his entry fee for the privilege to shake hands with as many people as possible. Whilst the aforementioned chants slightly hindered our enjoyment of Terry Francis’ riproaring set, it’d be hard to deny the man’s talents as a DJ, both in terms of mixing and selections - borne from fifteen years of hard graft.</p>\n<p>The enigmatic Rrose then took to room two’s stage for a rare live set, dressed true to name as an elegant woman – something that sparked a nightlong gender debate, which is probably what Rrose wanted all along. Beginning with a dense wall of rumbling low-end peppered with static, Rrose slowly revealed a thudding pulse underneath the thick fog of noise. As the mix progressed his texturally rich soundscapes began to take a more obviously danceable form. Running the gamut of his discography with powerful live renditions of tracks like ‘Secretion’, Rrose brought proceedings to a fitting peak, culminating with one of the last releases on the Sandwell imprint - the grainy, industrial-rave inflected, ‘Waterfall’. With Francis’ set comprising mainly of synapse shredding tracks pitched up to 130bpm, Rrose’s immaculately crafted yet comparatively woozy live set led to a discernible drop in crowd energy. Looking back, he probably would have been better suited to the opening slot, although we can’t complain too much.</p>\n<p>I’m sure many were sad to see Dave Sumner (Function) unable to perform due to ‘unforeseen circumstances’, although truth be told, as last minute replacements go, James Ruskin is a pretty fucking good one. The last minute set change seemed not to faze either party, perhaps due to the fact they have worked closely together in the past, as O/V/R. Between the two of them O’Connor and Ruskin traversed a set of pounding warehouse tracks, interspersed with the sub bass manipulations of Wax and Roman Lindau, building from Rrose’s hour of brooding sound design. Sandwell District completely abolished the tried and tested rave formula of tension-climax-release, opting to keep the ball constantly rolling and the serotonin rushing - the only reprieve from the sonic onslaught came with the violent swing of Pev &amp; Kowton’s ‘Raw Code’.</p>\n<p>The arrested futurism of dance music is always prevalent in any good Techno set - incorporating the elements of space; speed; violence; and above all its visceral thrill into a few hours of music. Sandwell District’s launch party, (despite some flawed programming) encapsulated all of this, pushing the Martin Audio sound system to its limits while never losing focus of sending the crowd into explosive ecstasy.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>To those with even a cursory interest in the Techno, Markus Suckut is probably a familiar title - tracks such as ‘Hunt’ and ‘False’ proved more than strong contenders for 2012’s end of year lists. Having released for iconic labels such as Stroboscopic Artefacts and Len Faki’s Figure SPC, Suckut’s productions tread a line between gritty industrial sound design, and hypnotic, groove laden Techno.</p>\n<p>Following an impressive slew of 12”s since his debut in 2010, Suckut has recently taken on the perilous challenge of releasing in the album format - however ‘DNA’ by our reckoning takes on this challenge with ease, and presents perhaps the most unique sound we’ve heard yet from Markus.</p>\n<p>With the album’s release planned for the 20th of this month, we were given the wonderful opportunity to catch up with Markus, to discuss the new album, his own imprint ‘SCKT’, and the pressures of making music for your heroes.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: I believe i’m right in saying that your not a Berliner, and are somewhat removed from the heart of the Techno scene in Germany, considering this, how did you first encounter electronic music? Was it part of the landscape for you whilst growing up, or was there a particularly pivotal moment?</strong></p>\n<p>M: Yes that’s correct, I’m not living in Berlin and to be honest I really enjoy that fact. Where I live is definitely not a huge space for a Techno scene in the clubs, it’s more about the house thing, may I say the more commercial stuff. I mean, I really like Berlin and try to stay longer when I play there to meet friends and to do some shopping. But for me it’s nice to have that contrast of being on the road and coming back home to have a chance to lean back and to relax. I guess if I would live in Berlin, the influence and the inspiration would be a huge difference, and I think it’s good that you don’t know all the time whats happening music wise in Berlin. May a few people recognize that in my tracks, that I do my thing without any influence of other Techno artists in my area.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: At what point did you decide you wanted to take a more active role, and begin DJing and producing?</strong></p>\n<p>M: There were no particular plans to do it professionally, it just happened somehow and I think that’s the way it should be, isn’t it?</p>\n<p><strong>SL: Judging by your DJ sets, and your choice to keep your own imprint ‘SCKT’ vinyl only, you have a real respect for the format, what drives this passion for you?</strong></p>\n<p>M: Vinyl was the first medium I got in touch with when I started DJing. For me it’s all about the feeling, to go into a record shop, spend a few hours and in the end you have something to hold in your hands.</p>\n<p>It’s so nice to hold music in your hands, instead of just using files. It’s also about limitation for me, you are not able to have all your records with you when you play at a club.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: In a relatively short space of time you have managed to release on some of the most well respected labels in electronic music, how did your relationship with these labels develop? Especially Len Faki’s Figure SPC, who will be releasing your debut album in May.</strong></p>\n<p>M: Yes, everything turned good for me in such a short time. It’s incredible and still can’t believe that. It’s unbelievable to get the respect and attention of people who have been in the business for such a long time, and are kind of legends to me. Especially with Len it became like a friendship, we have fun together when we are on the road and have a chat more than once a week. I never thought about that album thing before and it just happened, cause I felt at home at Figure. Len gives me a lot of freedom and that is great, because it shows that he trusts me and and believes in the music I make. So I decided to concentrate just on Figure and my own label SCKT in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: Is it exciting or daunting to produce music for your heroes? Is it something that makes it easier or harder to work?</strong></p>\n<p>M: It is exciting to me. It is great to get that kind of attention but it’s always hard for me then. I always think ‘oh i don’t want to fuck up in the studio’ and not disappoint.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: Having picked up a lot of attention for your early releases on Stroboscopic Artefacts and Figure SPC, you began an impressively prolific remix schedule. Do you think this period helped to develop your skills? Also is it something you will continue to do in the future? I read somewhere that you wished to focus more on your own original material.</strong></p>\n<p>M: Yes that’s right, I am taking time off doing remixes but there are still some to get released during the year. I came to a point where I realized that I don’t have the energy to focus that much on remixes anymore. Of course I think it helped a lot to get recognized out there, especially with remixes for Alan Fitzpatrick and names like that. But as I said, I’ve realized that it’s not the same, like in the beginning when I was doing less remixes. Thats why I’ve decided to focus more on my own original stuff now and I try to be very picky in the future with remixes for sure.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: ‘DNA’ is your first major project, and a brilliant one at that! It seems you have really found your own sound, and the album is a way of projecting that fully. Is this a fair assumption?</strong></p>\n<p>M: Well, I would say ‘DNA’ is my second major project, but I think that’s just my point of view in this case, cause it’s really hard to do a good job with your own label.</p>\n<p>But I would agree totally by saying that I found my own sound signature. I’ve realized that more and more during the process of writing the album and in the end, it’s 100% me, as Len took it just like I’ve send to him - which is such a huge compliment to me. That’s why I wanted to call it ‘DNA’ - it’s me, what I like to do, what I like to listen to, what I like to play out.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: How long had you been working on the album, both as an idea for a project as well as the actual recording process?</strong></p>\n<p>M: To be honest, the first track ‘Path’ was done in 2010, even before any release on Figure. I had that track for a long time, showed it to nobody, because I was not sure what I could do with it at that point. After my first release on Figure SPC, the ‘J’, I had to play in Hamburg together with Len, for kind of the first Figure Night in 2011 I guess. I was so nervous, because I’d never met him in person before. We just had rare chats via email, to exchange music and ideas. So we met in his hotel room before the night started and talked closely about my future because he had a lot of unreleased material from me and also the ‘K’ with Jeroen was finished then.</p>\n<p>We were just kidding around and the idea of doing an album in the future came up somehow. I said, yes may we should try - I have that one track laying around at home which could fit on an album.</p>\n<p>From there on I started to work on ‘DNA’ from time to time, as the idea was to have no pressure. We always said, it’s done when it’s done. In the end it was a good decision to have no pressure at all. At the point where I thought it was done I send it over to Len and it took a while until he got back to me, but the rest you can imagine now.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: I may be completely wrong but the album sounds less computer based, have you been working with much hardware in producing it?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://s1213.photobucket.com/user/straylandings/media/Suckut.jpg.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img align=\"right\" alt=\"photo Suckut.jpg\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://i1213.photobucket.com/albums/cc469/straylandings/Suckut.jpg\" width=\"200\"/></a></p>\n<p>M: I’ve bought more and more hardware during that period and of course I tried to include some ideas which I’ve created with my new things. But all the arrangement and basic sketches I’ve done with my computer.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: Some of the tracks on your album, particularly ‘Doomed’ and ‘Path’ demonstrate real musical experimentation for you, far beyond the limits of the dance floor. Is this something which attracted you to the possibility of an album? Also can we expect more leftfield leaning releases from yourself in the future?</strong></p>\n<p>M: I never had the idea to do that typical thing - like hey, i’m doing an album now, I have to do some experimental stuff. Those tracks just happened and it made a lot of sense to include them on the album for Len and me. I think there won’t be more things like that, as it’s not my idea of doing EP’s or something like that - I always want it to be danceable.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: I was surprised to see that most of the tracks on ‘DNA’ are fairly short when compared with some of your other material, is this a shift towards a more concise approach? Or was it an attempt to showcase more of your sound within the album’s time constraints?</strong></p>\n<p>M: That was also something which just happened to be, I never thought about a limitation of time on a track, especially on the album, but it was also clear that I didn’t want to have a ten minute track on the album or something like that. Also I was sure that we would do it on 2x12”. I think it would have been a bit sad to have just six tracks on the vinyl format, wouldn’t it?</p>\n<p><strong>SL: And to ask you briefly about some of your other activities, what made you decide to set up your own Label SCKT?</strong></p>\n<p>M: I was at a point where I had material that I had no idea who would like to release it, and it was always my dream to have complete freedom, in every point. Artwork and music. I think it was the right decision to go that way.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F29988443&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>SL: At what point did you decide you wanted to have the remix series on the label? Does this mean that the label will begin releasing other people for full releases?</strong></p>\n<p>M: It never was the idea to do remixes and to be honest I don’t remember the point where I decided to do it. I just had that list in my head, if I would do remixes on my label, then just these few guys and I’m happy that it worked out like that. Everyone who I had on my list was cool with the idea doing a remix. The remix series is something special on SCKT, that’s for sure. Next year I will go on to release just my own material again. I have also had a few ideas for another project on SCKT already, and also to take it a step further, but these are just ideas. I really don’t know if that will ever happen. One thing is for sure, SCKT will stay my own little baby.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: It must be incredible to have someone who releases as rarely as DVS1 remixing for the label, how did this particular remix come about? Are you still a primarily vinyl DJ, considering the stresses of your hectic DJ schedule?</strong></p>\n<p>M: It was during last year. I’ve asked all the guys on my list and told them my idea. To do a different artwork and that it would just be a short series which I would do just once.</p>\n<p>Also DVS1 was on my list. I knew that he liked my sound and what I do but never expected that he would do a remix for me. So yes, that’s something really special to me. It took him a long time to finish it, but in the end it was worth it.</p>\n<p>I recognized that i play more and more CD’s at the moment, I always try to play vinyl but sometimes it just doesn’t work out in the club, and it’s also a pain in the ass when you take a flight, you never know if your records will show up at the luggage belt.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: Finally, what is next for Markus Suckut? I certainly hope it involves a trip to London at some point!</strong></p>\n<p>M: There are still some remixes to get released during this year, another remix EP on SCKT which I am also very proud of and of course something on Figure - surprise surprise!</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F89696651&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Since then the pair’s following has moved on so much so that their debut 12” is now out in the open, via Darkfloor Sound. The Output EP sits somewhere between the ice-cold electronic precision of Alva Noto, and the merciless industrial battering of Perc or Tommy Four Seven.</p>\n<p>The aforementioned comparisons are most relevant through opener and title track ‘Output’, which sees waves of static surging over noise-laden kicks. The charm and intensity of the track comes from the sheer mass of the sound, and the bold monotony of the loops. Indeed, this is a style that features prominently throughout their work, and has a distinctly modernised feel to the classic Throbbing Gristle-style industrial music of the UK.</p>\n<p>'Disorientation' lives up to its title, mixing piercing dial-up tones with a rock solid kick snare stomp. Despite the harshness of its textures, the track packs a lot of punch, with dynamic shifts that would be perfectly suited to the more extreme end of a Techno DJ set.</p>\n<p>Without shunning their penchant for abrasive noise, ‘Centrifugal Force’ is probably the most texturally rich cut of the four, introducing hissing atmospheres to an otherwise familiar Ontal formula. It also gives the duo an opportunity to showcase their skills as experimental musicians, as the grooves in this track are far from conventional. Typewriter taps shuffle above what sounds like an almost random set of kicks, making it difficult to place the pulse of each bar. Nevertheless, that is the point, and once again Ontal manage to confound the listener into a sonically induced stupor.</p>\n<p>‘Darkfloor’ closes the EP nicely with a refreshingly minimal and subtle take on their sound. The sombre horns that run throughout wouldn’t sound out of place on an early DMZ record, and would fit equally well within tracks from the likes of Demdike Stare and the Blackest Ever Black crew, and what this track shows us is that Ontal are capable of creating plenty of atmosphere, too.</p>\n<p>Overall this EP has got a lot of diversity both in dynamic and character, and I would be surprised if there wasn’t at least one track that didn’t appeal to the reader. Personally, I think there’s an awful lot of content packed into this EP that I’m not going to get bored of for a long while, and I’m immensely excited about experimenting with the 12” when it comes.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F88392633&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

With further listening however, it becomes apparent that there is a level of craftsmanship and musicality through the release that sets Spatial’s latest work miles ahead of its weathered and actually fairly distant relations.</p>\n<p>Opener ‘Set Apart’ is perhaps a good summation of this, entering the setting of twisted Techno recently endorsed by the likes of MPIA3, through its use of overdriven kicks and crunchy high-end. It quickly veers off course however, partially relaxing into the jacking house styles typical of WNCL releases. This said, Spatial’s darker elements do not dampen themselves alongside the introduction of liquid rave stabs. ‘Set Apart’s second curveball comes at the midpost, with the introduction of some fairly inebriating string samples. These sickly-sweet textures are quickly joined by Spatial’s first use of vocal samples which run through a brief buildup, before dropping out as the track reverts back to its more simplistic origins.</p>\n<p>Of the four tracks, ‘Right Now’ is closest in nature to ‘Set Apart’ as the majority of its attention is given to infectious house grooves, and similarly lighthearted rave chords.</p>\n<p>The pairing of ‘Set Apart’ and ‘Right Now’ seems all the more logical when assessing the similarities between the EP’s other two offerings; the crazed, ‘Lost’, and similarly manic closer, ‘Syn Cop’. Both possess a fervent intensity created by Spatial’s fantastic use of acid hooks and contorted electro glitches. Of the two, ‘Syn Cop’ is the more affront, shaking off the shoulder-shrugging swung rhythms of ‘Lost’, in favour of breakneck Acid-Techno.</p>\n<p>The WNCL press release includes a quote from Spatial - suggesting a desire to create something out of the ordinary, moderated by the hankering to produce material which is club friendly. To my mind the EP, as with most of Spatial’s releases achieves both these feats with an air of ease that suggests its nothing more than instinctive to him.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F87992375&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Tom Dicicco is an artist who seems to release cautiously, exercising an astoundingly high level of quality control over his own productions. The same can also be said of the music he releases as co-owner of Inner Surface Music (along with AnD), a label which’s short discography is wholly made up for by the quality of each release.</p>\n<p>Dicicco’s latest venture comes in the form of a new solo fronted imprint entitled Run Out Run. With June seeing its inaugural release, we were given the opportunity to chat to the man himself about his new imprint, musical heroes, and how his time spent in Manchester affected his productions.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: So first off, how’s this year been going for you?</strong></p>\n<p>TD: I’ve had a great year so far thanks, most of it has been spent preparing the new label, I didn’t want to rush it so I’ve took my time making sure everything is right from the tracks chosen for the first EP to the type of sleeves I wanted to use. Everything had to be just right. It’s important for me not to overlook anything in the process from start to finish and I’m happy with where it’s at now with the first release ready to go.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: What was it that prompted you to set up your own label? Was it a case of wanting to release tracks you found it difficult to find a home for?</strong></p>\n<p>TD: It just felt like the right time to do it. It’s something I’ve wanted to do for a long time and after a discussion in Berlin with Carola and Philip at Pullproxy after my gig at Berghain in January I decided to start putting some ideas together and its progressed from there.</p>\n<p>**SL: Do you plan to use the label as an outlet purely for your own productions (similarly to how Perc Trax was conceived) or are there releases from other artists lined up? **</p>\n<p>TD: The first three EP’s will all be my own productions. That is what I have planned at the moment release schedule wise. After that I’m hoping to put out some collaborative work but I haven’t planned on putting any other artist’s solo work out, we’ll see what happens.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: I believe I am right in saying you are also co-owner of Inner Surface Music along with AnD, how do you think Run Out Run will differ in terms of its output?</strong></p>\n<p>TD: Yes myself and AnD run Inner Surface Music. We met while I was studying in Manchester. Andro worked at Eastern Bloc Records so I got to know him well through picking up records on my lunch break at university and at weekends and through Andro I met Dimitri. We were all into the same music and spent many evenings working on tracks at Dimitri’s house. At this time we were both thinking about a label and between us we decided to start Inner Surface. Run Out Run is a platform for my music as well as collaborative work, we set Inner Surface up to release other artist’s music we liked as well as our own so it’s more of an open label compared to Run Out Run.</p>\n<p>**SL: With releases on both labels coming up i’m taking it things are fairly hectic at the moment?  **</p>\n<p>TD: Yes it’s quite hectic at the moment but not too crazy. There’s never any rush to release anything and get it out there for the sake of it. There’s been a small gap in between the last release on Inner Surface and the upcoming release but that’s not a problem for us. The next release on Inner Surface is a Various Artists EP featuring AnD, Truss, Ascion and Sunil Sharpe. I’m really excited about this as we spent a long time deciding on the tracks and what we felt worked best and now it’s all ready to go we’re all very happy with it. The first EP on Run Out Run will be out in June and is Part 1 of a 2 Part series. Part 2 will be out later on in the year. I’ll also have a track on the sixth Inner Surface release, which will also be out later on in the year.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i1213.photobucket.com/albums/cc469/straylandings/399611_517824354913302_362216130_n-1.jpg\" alt=\"photo 399611_517824354913302_362216130_n-1.jpg\"></p>\n<p><strong>SL: Who would you say your musical heroes are? Although you are based in the UK, to me your productions seem more inline with a more European brand of Techno.</strong></p>\n<p>I wouldn’t say they’re my musical heroes but my biggest musical influences would have to be Levon Vincent and René Pawlowitz aka Shed. For me they are the most consistent producers around and both have a very unique style, a signature sound. I think that’s the most important thing in music, to try and be as original as you can be and maintain that for as long as possible. If people don’t like it then it doesn’t matter because you’re being true to yourself. I do love UK Techno and for me James Ruskin is second to none. As for musical heroes mine would definitely be my dad, no doubt!</p>\n<p>**SL: Most of your releases have been solo. Is collaborating something that comes easily to you, or do you find it easier to work in isolation? **</p>\n<p>TD: I definitely find it easier working alone. Sometimes when working with other artists I’ll be sitting there and it’s as if I’ve never made a track before. I just feel incapable of coming up with anything half decent and look like an idiot. For that reason I prefer doing collaborations online, sending projects and ideas back and forth and working on them in my own time.</p>\n<p>**SL: To what extent do you think the work of your peers drives your own ambitions? I have read that you studied in Manchester, which has a pretty impressive roster of electronic artists. **</p>\n<p>TD: Moving to Manchester to study was the best decision I ever made. Having met AnD and then subsequently meeting Indigo, Synkro, Szare and Arnaldo meant there was a great bunch of us around swapping tracks and getting feedback, going to gigs and hanging around at Eastern Bloc Records. Manchester is an amazing city and I definitely miss it! For the past 6 years I have sent everything I have ever made to Answer Code Request. We’ve been friends for a long time and he’s been a huge influence for me. I trust Patrick’s judgment and know he’ll be 100% honest with me good or bad, which I really appreciate.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F59592295&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<p>**SL: Gaining such impressive support (such as from Jonas Kopp) whilst still in University must have been pretty intense, how have things developed over the last few years? **</p>\n<p>TD: Yes it’s very humbling to receive support from artists and DJ’s you have a lot of respect for and Jonas has supported me massively since the baud release in 2010, which I’m very thankful for. Since the baud release things have developed at a pace I’m happy with. I’m not one to rush things so I’m quite happy how things have developed over the last few years, not too slow and not too fast.</p>\n<p>I have all my releases in place for this year so I can start work on making new material for 2014.</p>\n<p>**SL: How much of what you write makes it to a public forum? Would you say you exercise a fair amount of quality control over your productions? **</p>\n<p>TD: Yes definitely. There are many many tracks on my hardrive that will never get released, as I don’t feel there anywhere near good enough to be released. Sometimes I come back to old projects that are finished but went in the rubbish folder and use certain elements from them to create new tracks that do end up being released so it’s all a work in progress. I’d much rather put out 2-3 great EP’s a year than 5 average EP’s.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: And finally, what are your plans for the rest of the year? Any exciting gigs coming up?</strong></p>\n<p>TD: The rest of the year will be preparing new music for next year, and focusing on my gigs. In June I’ll be at the first Contrast party at OT301 in Amsterdam and at Untertauchen’s fourth birthday party at GoetheBunker in Essen, really excited about both of those. Then after that it’s more gigs and new tracks while trying to keep up with Game Of Thrones haha.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F88971886&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

The label is as consistent as it is exciting, and a firm favourite over here at Stray Landings. The only issue we have is keeping up to date with the label’s prolific releases schedule. Never the less, this multi-artist EP includes some incredible music, each contributor appearing to have pulled out their best work.</p>\n<p>The EP begins with the Argentine giant, Jonas Kopp. ‘Mountak’ is an exercise in driving melodic Techno, it feels comfortably fast pushing way out of lazy dancing territory and into full on raving mode. Having said that, its full force is only felt when listened across the whole seven minutes. At first glance, its melodic structure feels familiarly simple, but as the track progresses the chords swell and rise to euphoric levels. Kopp’s familiar control of the percussive elements is decidedly understated, leaving the chords and subtle leads to drive the track forward; it is an outstanding track from an artist on top of his game.</p>\n<p>The next offering comes from Minneapolis native Dustin Zahn, ‘Forward unto Dawn’ feels slightly slower than the first track and perhaps suffers from it considering the minimal sound pallet. However, much like the Kopp piece it manages to blend a very familiar set of percussive tropes with refreshingly hypnotizing, chord drones. Again it is a piece that lends itself to an extended play, the slow build up is to be honest relatively dull, but as is gets into full swing by the four minute mark we are reminded why this mix of tension and release is so effective, particularly for the dance floor.</p>\n<p>It was certainly nice to hear a new contribution from Flug on this EP. Across the Stray Landings team there was a lingering concern that the remixes on his last release for Sleaze overshadowed him slightly, so to see him produce something that stands out clearly on the EP is really impressive. ‘No Way Out’ feels much slower than the previous two tracks on the EP but this time is entirely appropriate. There is very little in the way of melodic development in this track, instead low swung drums are occasionally augmented by dissonant lead lines to head nodding effect. The tonal quality of the percussive repetition is outstanding and on the right sound system would be all the best kinds of hypnotic. The steady arrangement of the track and slow build ups, which on occasion are punctuated by outrageously obtuse synth flutters, make sure boredom is the last feeling produced by this aptly titled claustrophobic wonder.</p>\n<p>To say that Sleaze saved the best till last is certainly difficult with an EP of this quality and pitting the last track against what was the firm favourite up until this point from Kopp is probably unnecessary. BUT, the three way collaborative track ‘RS7000’ from Tony Rohr, Billy Johnston &amp; Gennaro Mastrantonio is to use the correct terminology… A BOMB! Up until the four minute mark we are treated to driving 808 percussion in the low end, and sharp and well placed percussion up top, and to be honest with you that would have been enough from them and it would have impressed me. But, at the 4 minute mark we are given an incredible twisting chord line, which builds up to what feels like a typical mega drop, only to be subdued again as the bass comes back in. This is the best of what dance floor Techno can be, both tough and emotive. Its composition is masterful and has to be the highlight of what is a really stunning EP from the Glasgow label. If quality like this continues, then this Sleaze select series may turn out to be a real treasure trove of future classics.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F93033188&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Further testament to their success is that their third comes via the recently established label arm of Fabric nightclub, Houndstooth.</p>\n<p>The Navigate EP sees Akkord filling in the blanks between Dubstep, D&amp;B &amp; Techno. Whilst on paper this may sound like a potentially chaotic mix, under the guidance of Akkord’s rather strict minimalist tendencies the combination begins to make a lot of sense. The way in which they pull off this mix is pretty unique, and I think it’d be fair to say they’ve carved out a solid niche for themselves.</p>\n<p>Title track ‘Navigate’ makes for a strong opening - short, twitchy hats ride over glitching percussion and swelling bass work. The track’s shuffling rhythmic elements are carried off with merciless precision, assorted shakers and foley hits join with heavily processed vocals snippets and stifling atmospherics.</p>\n<p>The same tough sonic palette is carried over into ‘Compound’, although the track moves into more tribal territories, and is generally more affront than the EPs lurching opener. An unmistakably D&amp;B inspired bass-line occasionally punctuates the tracks dense atmosphere and heavyweight grooves.</p>\n<p>'Destruction' on the other hand takes its biggest cues from DMZ era dubstep, deep, menacing subs rumbling underneath aqueous textures and cumbersome swung rhythms.</p>\n<p>A welcome reprieve from Akkord’s unrelenting darkened tones is offered by the closer however, ‘Title Sequence’ takes loosened dub grooves and introspective synth drones, underpinning soothing vocal samples.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F88593729&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Radio Slave has become somewhat of a household name in the world of Techno over the past few years. Releases such as the No Sleep and Tankatan series, as well as his prominence in the Berlin club scene have consolidated him as modern-day figurehead in electronic music. We caught up with him to talk Rekids, relocating to Berlin, and his latest mix for Balance that spans all manner of house, soul, funk and rare oddities…</p>\n<p><strong>SL: I guess we should start with what you have been up to these last few months. The new Balance CD that you have mixed is out on the 27th – what was it like working on that?</strong></p>\n<p>R: Well it took some time to complete and the process started around the beginning of last year as my label partner and I had been planning some kind of compilation to celebrate my 20 years of Djing and in the end we decided to go with Balance. James Masters (Rekids) has known Tom Balance for some time as we’ve licensed tracks for previous editions and I was on his list of compilers so it kind f made sense and of course I’m a huge fan of the series. From there I went about compiling a track list and originally the release date was planned for March 2013. But with all these things, there are delays and I was super sick in January after a minor operation and this also pushed the compilation back to May. It’s been a tough year for me so far but getting this compilation done and now seeing the finished copies really brings a smile to my face.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: Your new CD sounds more similar to something we might hear in Panorama Bar, if only for its length. Do you prefer playing long sets? Is it a completely different approach?</strong></p>\n<p>R: I love to play for a long time if the environment is right and it’s great to play a wide variety of musical styles and this can really only happen when you have the time and freedom to express yourself and I guess with the Balance compilation, CD 1 is definitely a snap shot of the me DJ’ing at somewhere like the Panorama Bar.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: So is the selection on here representative of what you would normally play out? Any personal favorites on here?</strong></p>\n<p>R: For sure this is exactly what I’m playing out and I’m really happy that so many of the labels agreed to licensing the tracks as many are vinyl only and haven’t ever been used for a compilation. And I’m super happy to have been able to use the Melchoir Production’s track “Desendents” and also tracks like Vadim Sovoboda’s “Pattern 18” as this is unreleased and I’ve been playing it everywhere for months.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: The two CDs certainly have a different feel to them. Was this intentional?</strong></p>\n<p>R: Definitely and It might sound kind of cheesy but the whole concept was to take the listener on a journey to the club and back home and I really wanted to create a very personal vibe.</p>\n<p>**SL: Who’s been your favourite person to play alongside? Who would you most like to play with in the future? **</p>\n<p>R: I’m always happy to DJ with Marcel Dettmann. He’s a great friend and we’re playing back to back in Detroit this weekend. I’m also a big fan of my good friend Spencer Parker and of course I always have a lot of fun playing with Nina Kraviz.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: Do you play with both Vinyl and CD? Is there a preference? Do you play differently when using one versus the other?</strong></p>\n<p>R: I actually only buy the music I play in clubs on vinyl. I’m not a digital consumer and it just doesn’t appeal to me. I love to go record shopping and it’s great to have that social interaction with the people who work at record stores and also I’m always dropping hard drives or laptops so for me storing digital information is a nightmare.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: What are your thoughts on the recent resurgence of vinyl sales? Do you think it will be short-lived or this is the beginning of some kind of vinyl revolution?</strong></p>\n<p>R: Personally I think it’s a fad and like most things it will come and go. Most of the DJ’s I see outside of Europe are using Tracktor and it’s actually really hard to buy vinyl in a lot of countries. But saying this, I believe vinyl will survive as a format and I still love it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2857/8869959984_ab18cf60d6.jpg\" alt=\"RS\"></p>\n<p><strong>SL: I understand that your background is in graphic design and art. How important is artwork to you for your releases? Is it auxiliary to the music or do you feel it’s an important aspect of the whole experience?</strong></p>\n<p>R: As a physical format enthusiast I’m all about creating a complete package and the artwork has always been a crucial part of releasing music. It gives the music an identity and can create an illusion or be very natural depending on the artist and type of music and we’ve always tried to give our artists an opportunity to express themselves through the artwork.</p>\n<p>**SL: To what extent does the software you use alter the way you make music? **</p>\n<p>R: Well i don’t really think it matters what software you use. You just need ideas! Anyone can replicate any musical genre these days with a computer or even a phone but being original and having fresh ideas is what you’ll need if you want to standout.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: You’re big on remixes. What attracts you to it? Do you think there are parallels to be drawn between the philosophy of remixing and sampling in hip-hop? What do you enjoy about remixing pop music in particular?</strong></p>\n<p>R: I guess one of the best parts about remixing is the fact that you get sent all the individual or separated tracks that make up the song and I find it fascinating to see how songs are stitched together. And I love listening to these songs broken down into their parts and I really learned so much from this when I was starting out making my own productions. These days you can find the stems or parts online for so many tracks and I think as a producer it’s a great way to really study what makes a song work.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: How do you think the culture of downloading music has affected DJing? How do you try and get round the problem of file sharing when you release things on CD?</strong></p>\n<p>R: The downloading of music has changed the whole industry upside down and the reality is that most labels are losing money with each release. Digital sales are falling as most kids will just grab the files for free and it’s made running a record label a real labour of love and it’s incredibly hard to stop people from sharing files. Most vinyl only releases sold at Hardwax seem to be uploaded and available for free the day the record is released which is crazy, and with Rekids we spend a lot of time and money trying to stop people sharing music illegally but it seems impossible these days.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: I read recently that you didn’t want Rekids to be thought of as just a House &amp; Techno label. Are you planning to diversify the label into more experimental areas?</strong></p>\n<p>R: I’d love to release all kinds of music and I guess with Rekids we have a great roster already of artists who’s main focus is the dance floor. So because of this we recently launched the “Pyramids of Mars” label which is much more experimental and earlier this year we released an ambient LP from Vincent I. Watson and the Joe Claussell remixes of my “Machine” project.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: How does your setting affect what you do musically? Moving from Brighton to Berlin, how would you compare the two cities?</strong></p>\n<p>R: Nothing compares to Berlin and I feel incredibly luck and privileged to live in the city. I don’t feel like England is my home anymore and I’m very happy living in Kreuzberg. This area of Berlin is still really very culturally diverse and we have the best club in the world just across the river. It’s also a great place to buy music with stores like Hardwax and Space Hall and there’s always something going on 24-7. For this reason the only down side is getting things done and I don’t think many people actually go to work on a Monday.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: Can we expect to hear more music under the Rekid moniker in the future? What are the important differences between this name and Radio Slave?</strong></p>\n<p>R: I’m actually in the process of putting together ideas for the next Rekid LP. “Made in Menorca” was released 8 years ago on Soul Jazz and its taken me a long time to come back to this project which is basically a mix of Detroit influenced beatdown house and hip hop with a splash of new age electronica. It’s a space between the club and home.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: I read that you hope to bring out a Radio Slave LP in the future. Can you tell us something about your thinking behind this?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m planning to get this done over the summer and it’s gonna be based upon traveling around the world, and I can’t give away too much but I’m excited about the whole thing and feel really hungry to get this project off the ground.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F420303&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "date": "2013-06-02T00:00:00.000Z",
    "content": "<p>BleeD returned to Café Oto last Saturday with another bill of enterprising electronic music, beat-oriented and otherwise; with the main billing belonging to Philadelphia-based Bee Mask. Bee Mask is the alias of Chris Madak, previosuly a journeyman of some of the US underground’s most essential cassette and CDR labels, and now with three releases under his belt on the excellently curated Editions Mego offshoot Spectrum Spools, including last year’s <em>When We Were Eating Unripe Pairs</em> LP. Opening proceedings was Left Blank and Tri Angle signee Sebastian Gainsborough, better known as Vessel, whose shimmering take on house and techno felt a bit muted in the serene candlelit surrounds of Café Oto. With most of the audience seated, Vessel decided to follow by example and sat on the concrete floor behind various electronics. It felt a little voyeuristic from the audience – like watching someone messing about with a circuit board in their bedroom – and it felt quite detached. Presumably Gainsboruough felt a similar estrangement, as music so suited to audience participation is bound to be stilted in too formal a setting.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, both sets were intriguing and covered a lot of sonic territory. Particularly in the case of Bee Mask, whose ostensibly minimal set up of a laptop and a sampler/sequencer was responsible for producing a diverse world of sounds. Opening with a synth arpeggio that echoed the languid works of Roedelius, the first piece developed into a balmy and dense series of drones. The samples of various found sounds and instruments in addition to purely electronic tones was redolent of the music of Concern, another contemporary creator of such layered drones and nomad of the US underground.</p>\n<p>The opening piece came to an abrupt and somewhat humorous finish, and the performance as a whole covered ground that saw it go from beautifully melancholic to hilarious, with Madak’s theatrical gestures adding a comic lightness to the already warm and inviting soundtrack. However Madak’s music goes beyond mere welcoming ambience, and the moments of kaleidoscopic Iasos-esque reverie were balanced with darker and more intense segments. It’s music filled with a delight at sounds in themselves, taking them as being complete in as they are and not just utilitarian tools. In fact, Madak has spoken in interviews about not wanting his music generally to serve any particular purpose or to be an escape, but rather be a ‘layer of lived reality’; and in his music there is a real sense of the world being thrown out in front of us bare for our contemplation.</p>\n<p>Both on record and live, in the layered and more overwhelming moments, each individual sound has a certain opacity and does more than simply contribute to the complete picture and to a given emotional end. In the latter half of the performance, when things became more sparse and less ordered, each texture became even more accentuated and fascinating than it would have been otherwise. I was struck by what sounded like a bell, which reappeared several times throughout, and which conjured visions of some far off railway station, as if experienced in memory. The sublimity of Madak’s music often lies in its ability to evoke images of fantastical worlds, with soundscapes so dense and varied that they provide a set of tools for the freeplay of the listener to imagine a host of different  scenes. However, as Madak has stressed, his music is rooted in the world as it is; and despite the imaginative potential of it, it is more than some functional soundtrack to a lysergic daydream. Madak’s gestures as he performed, and the lack of visual accompaniment (something similar artists often rely upon), staved off the temptation to drift out of focus, and instead let the wide array of sounds being presented dictate the audience’s engagement.</p>\n",

The latest offering from the long-standing imprint comes in the form of a multi-artist EP, entitled No Way Back. Such EPs can often feel unharmonious as different musical approaches conflict, however No Way Back is curated with such skill that it feels more balanced than many solo releases. There has clearly been some thought put into the EP’s structure as well, as it slowly builds intensity across the four tracks.</p>\n<p>The EP opens with Dimi Angélis &amp; Jeroen Search’s deep, dubby excursion ‘Profound’, combining hissing atmospheres with echoing analogue synth work in the periphery. Brushing hi-hats punctuate the off-beat, whilst a throbbing bass-line runs underneath.</p>\n<p>Grindvik’s own contribution 'Culture Road' is surprisingly the track which deviates the most from the other offerings, and is composed of purely tribal infused percussive elements. A sparse, hypnotic tom driven melody is joined by sweeping hats and offbeat hits, in a euphoria inducing offering to the small hours.</p>\n<p>The EPs most climactic moment is undoubtably Jesper Dahlback’s ‘Intricate Machinery’. A robust bass-line leads the track, doggedly pursued by crunchy off-beat hats, tumbling claps and pounding kicks.</p>\n<p>Closer, Andre Kronert’s ‘Trip’ returns No Way Back to its dub-led origins, borrowing the groove infected bass-line from Maurizio’s legendary ‘M5’. Despite being pretty derivative the track does provide a significantly weightier interpretation of the dub techno pin-up’s original, injecting some much needed structure as well.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F88245488&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

It has been little surprise that he’s gained such significant support in such a short amount of time and with so few releases to his name, gathering interest from the likes of Jonas Kopp &amp; the Project Squared imprint.</p>\n<p>Dicicco’s latest 12”, Under The Aquadrome Pt.1, marks the first release of his newly founded label Run Out Run. Having co-founded Inner Surface Records along with Manchester’s AnD, Dicicco is no stranger to the label game, although it will certainly be interesting to see which direction this solo-fronted imprint will take. As the first footing for the new label however, Under The Aquadrome Pt.1 provides a more than promising start, focusing Dicicco’s excellent production skills on four warehouse ready cuts.</p>\n<p>Opener ‘Return To Dust’ is certainly the most kinetic of the EP’s offerings, and is grounded purely in clamourous rhythms. Gritty and uncompromising, grating high end chugs over thundering kicks and filtered atmospherics.</p>\n<p>The weighty, close-knit feel to ‘Return To Dust’ is a trait common to many of Dicicco’s productions, however not one shared by the EP’s comparatively sparse second track 'Mist Of 1807'. Hypnotic, pointed melodies twist over ticking hats and a regular 4/4 kick pattern making a perfect offering to the early hours.</p>\n<p>'Werk' sees a return to more defined textures however, and is a notable highlight on the EP. Blending chugging rhythms alongside an ominous, rugged bassline, 'Werk' maintains a level of tasteful restraint, without losing any power on the dancefloor.</p>\n<p>A little reprieve is offered in the form of the soothing ambience of closer, ‘Plate Subduction’. A light fog of grainy ambience keeps a strady level throughout, with Oneohtrix Point Never style sullen synth given focus.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F88971886&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Those privy to the recent explosion of upcoming Techno talent in the UK, will more than likely recognise the name WITCH. The Leicester based production duo first came to light when two tracks simply titled ‘A1’ &amp; ‘B1’ appeared on their Soundcloud. Catching interest from the likes of Happa, Boddika &amp; Avian affiliate Truss/MPIA3 the tracks have gained notoriety.</p>\n<p>Chatting to the pair recently, we were happy to find out that the aforementioned tracks, alongside ‘Vent’, are finally in the negotiation stages for release. “Its frustrating because we got so excited when we initially got a buzz around the tracks, we wanted to get something out as soon as possible so that people could hear it. Annoyingly the whole process feels dragged out - by the time they’re released they’ll be so old to us. But we want our music to be in the best hands possible and that just means waiting a bit more time.”</p>\n<p>WITCH’s physical release may be coming to fruition slightly later than those of their contemporaries such as Metrist, Ill Life, or Happa, but having a community of upcoming producers has obviously been useful to the pair. “We’d been big fans of theirs for a while so when they got in touch it was massively reassuring to know we’re doing something right. They’re our boys now so it’s always good to get a second opinion on something, or a bit of advice.”</p>\n<p>Similarly to their contemporaries, their sound has a heavy emphasis on atmospherics and sound design. This is perhaps an unsurprising fact given their musical backgrounds. “We’ve both studied electro-acoustic compositions and our big fans of the whole musique concrete thing, so that’s probably where the atmosphere comes from.”</p>\n<p>A penchant for more texturally rich Techno bleeds into their DJing styles as well. Their addition to the Stray mix series covers a range of industrial edged cuts. “We tried to make this one as interesting as possible, rather than play the records we’re buying at the moment. We thought it’d be cool to fill it with exclusives from mans in our field, and also a collection of unreleased material from ourselves with a cheeky old banger slotted in.”</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Kommune1 // TS1 [Unreleased]</li>\n<li>Randomer // No Hook (J.Tijn reshape) [Turbo Recordings]</li>\n<li>Forward Strategy Group // Elegant Mistakes [Perc Trax]</li>\n<li>British Murder Boys // Splinter [D/N]</li>\n<li>Happa // 13.05.13 [Boomkat Editions]</li>\n<li>Kommune 1 // Mitternacht [GnD]</li>\n<li>WITCH // Vent [Unreleased]</li>\n<li>WITCH // A1 [Unreleased]</li>\n<li>Metrist // ???

I guess this is to be expected from an imprint fronted by CLR affiliate and general Techno veteran Rebekah, but it is still great to hear new labels pop up and deliver more than their fair share to such a big scene. The latest of these golden finds, comes in the form of Brazilian born ‘Urbano’, providing the label with four tracks of vintage warehouse mayhem.</p>\n<p>The so titled 2XR909 EP is unflinchingly fierce throughout, tied together with off-kilt industrial percussion, and twisted metallic timbres. Second track ‘Cyprus’ makes a good example of this, as does the chaotic closer, ‘Transition’. Both tracks feature an array of crooked melodies and clamorous percussion, and feel constantly on the verge of derailing themselves.</p>\n<p>Title track ‘2XR909’ itself feels perhaps slightly hectic when compared with these two, but certainly looses nothing in directness and weight on the dance floor. 90s style, distorted kicks thud between clattering snares and a broken riff.</p>\n<p>‘Tight’ on the other hand is a completely different affair, and is something of a slow burner. Whilst with many releases the standout track is often the most intense, in the case of 2XR909, it is ‘Tight’s hypnotic, rolling grooves that gain it kudos. Billowing atmospheres and chugging hats run throughout, with leaden percussion punctuating the offbeats.</p>\n<p>As only the third outing for Decoy ‘2XR909’ maintains the labels exceptionally high standard, and leaves us as ever, excited and intrigued as to where the label will venture next. Urbano’s enthusiasm for jaunty, 90s indebted Rave-Techno is communicated loud and clear through this record, and is nothing short of contagious.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F5980676&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Stephen Pelling (Magnetic NW) has been quietly wowing us at Stray Landings for a good few months. His collaboration with Mannheim Rocket on the ‘Magnetic Rockets’ EP, as well as a stream of intriguing and brilliant Soundcloud submissions has earned him this attention, but it’s his latest track ‘Swallow Point’ that has truly brought his music into its own.</p>\n<p>As is usual for much of Pelling’s work, the textures and overall backdrop of Swallow Point is perhaps the most striking element of it. Pelling has described his work as ‘battered and bruised sounds from somewhere up north’, which is an apt description, particularly for this track. The grainy complexion of the production, as well as the interweaving sombre strings, manages to create an aura of sinister fog that envelops the metallic clunks throughout. This creates an interesting dynamic between the mathematical precision of the percussion, and the unbounded wideness of the ambience, which is what makes the sound so unique.</p>\n<p>Having only played a handful of shows, Magnetic NW has lots of room to develop, and fortunately a full-length LP is apparently in the works. Personally, I think his sound will translate very well to the album format and we can only hold our breath so to see what other wizardry he can conjure.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F93541609&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>To call this EP an impressive debut would be a tremendous understatement. Indeed, to bring it out on Len Faki’s label ‘Figure’ in the first place is quite a feat in itself – a label that has been host to some of biggest names in recent years, including Markus Suckut, Ed Davenport and Tony Lionni. However, Poncet is not at all overshadowed by these names. To the contrary, this EP fits in very comfortably amid the others, and establishes Poncet amongst the people to watch out for in the coming months, despite this EP being criminally slept on this year.</p>\n<p>Opener ‘Cerate’ is as hard and minimal as they come, laying some haunting, alarm-bell stabs over a rock-solid wall of bass. The call-and-answer dynamic is deployed with bold force, yet with exquisite simplicity - like the feeling of staring into the depths of an erratic strobe light. That’s all it does, but then, that’s all it needs to. There are definite nods to the likes of the aforementioned Markus Suckut, but of course Shed and Truncate’s brilliant ‘Dial’ also spring to mind.</p>\n<p>‘SSSN02’ keeps the monolithic weight moving, as enormous, jarring stomps are danced around and modulated, but not so much as to lose their strength. It’s also worth mentioning just how huge the kicks are on this EP – if you’re listening at home, it’s well worth cranking the volume just to feel how much power there is behind them. It’s a shame I’m still yet to hear any of it played out.</p>\n<p>‘Route of Pain’ closes the EP, with a refreshing, house-oriented outlook. Here, the EP takes a turn towards a more melodic refrain – the stabs are almost Jazz-like in their placement, floating above the mix fluidly, as if improvised on the recording. Despite this, the track still manages to pack a serious punch as those kicks once again permeate the sound, making this track a perfect Tech-House tool.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F5120711&show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Label owner Mannheim Rocket has described the labels output as “a series of experiments, all of the released tracks are akin to snapshots - encapsulating current ideas and influences.” Whatever it is, it certainly works, and their most recent release from visual artist and sound designer Lost Few also sees the inaugural vinyl release for 3BS.</p>\n<p>The 7” single ties together many of the differing musical approaches the imprint has explored before, opening with the sullen industrial stomp of ‘Winter’s Voice’. Those familiar with the Alva Noto’s collaborative work with Ryuichi Sakamoto will probably be able to draw some parallels here. Assorted classical timbres ebb and flow between layers of gristled static and Neubauten reminiscent, downtempo percussion.</p>\n<p>B-side ‘Through The Eyes’ begins with a melancholic web of ambience, as crackling musique concréte style samples are punctuated by timid prepared piano sounds. The low-end is occupied by a dull marching kick drum, patiently driving the track forward. The absence of mid-range frequencies leaves the track feeling sparse and hollow, to wonderful atmospheric effect.</p>\n<p>Following on from its handful of digital and cassette releases, it’s incredibly gratifying to see 3BS stepping up to the vinyl format, and equally rewarding to hear Lost Few’s haunting, ethereal contributions on top form.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F96085148&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Derived in an effort to see if the productions could stand on their own two feet, the Midlands based label/artist project’s inaugural release consists of four powerfully rugged industrial workouts.</p>\n<p>Opening with the lurching stomp of ‘A Death In The Family’, the track sets a menacing tone for the EP, swaying between gnarled snares and clamourous hi-hats, constantly under the guidance of an infectious, driving bassline. The track also makes clear the He/aT project’s penchant for factory-style atmospherics, and wouldn’t sound out of place in a mix by Regis or Function.</p>\n<p>The same frayed textures are just as present through ‘The Creeping’, although as the title might suggest the track takes a more cloak and dagger approach than the opener. Low-slung rhythms work into a steady march, with a bassy, metallic riff pulsing along underneath.</p>\n<p>‘A Gentleman’s Agreement’ sees a return to a more affront brand of Techno however, and is also a notable highlight on the EP. An array of frenetic hi-hats and other assorted percussive elements are given central focus, as rumbling bass drones throb underneath.</p>\n<p>‘River Styx &amp; The Goat Of Mendes’ is undoubtedly the most experimental of the four offerings. Relentless atmospheres reminiscent of those in Rrose’s ‘Secretion’, grate between ticking percussion and soporific melodies, leaving the listener with a level of intrigue that can only spell good things for the future of the He/aT project.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F5057176&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Creating a cohesive narrative whilst still remaining floor friendly is a tall order, and sees many artists resorting to cynically contrived ambient excursions to forcefully inject dynamics into full length releases which would be better condensed to several EP releases. Contrasting with this, the success of Q’Hey’s latest album <em>Core,</em> comes from the fact that it is unashamedly brimming with full-throttle, warehouse bangers.</p>\n<p>Whilst there are some downtempo moments such as haunting opener ‘Accord’ and the cavernous ‘Montreux’, structurally the album feels more like a mix than an album, and to my mind, this seems like a remarkably intelligent way to approach the album challenge.</p>\n<p>Stylistic parallels can be found with Richie Hawtin’s Minus Imprint in tracks such as ‘Call The Crap’, ‘Wasted Land’ or ‘Give Me’, through their rollicking basslines, despite the underlying grit obviously lacking in the comparatively sterile offerings of producers such as Matador or Gaiser.</p>\n<p>Rave throwbacks ‘North Wind’ and ‘Buddyroid’ posses equal amounts of the aforementioned ruggedness; slow euphoric builds awash with white noise and pulsating, distorted rhythms.</p>\n<p>'Enter' is a notable highlight, and the sort of thing you wouldn't be surprised to see DVS1 spinning at 5am. As the second to last this certainly fits in the idea of <em>Core</em> being treated similarly to a mix; delayed chimes reminiscent of those in Psyk’s ‘Arcade’ ride throbbing  kicks and invasive, vapourous atmospheres.</p>\n<p>Whilst crafted with impeccably high production standards, there is a something playful in <em>Core’s</em> nature, perhaps stemming from the fact that this is an album built for parties, and Q’Hey rightfully makes no concessions for this.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F96616783&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Having released with Appleblim’s stellar Apple Pips label, as well as the impeccable Sneaker Social Club, the Al Tourettes moniker was synonymous with quirky, Dubstep inspired steppers. Fast forward to current day and we see the imminent release of Mr Storey’s latest work for Fabric’s Houndstooth imprint - this time under the byname Second Storey.</p>\n<p>For the most part, Storey’s change in alias appears not to have signified too much of a drastic shift in his productions - this said the Margosa Heights release does feature a more defined measure of musicality, that was usually left as a backdrop through the oddball percussive excursions of the Al Tourettes releases.</p>\n<p>Múm reminiscent, tinkling electronica opens ‘Arpy Gables’, but as the track develops these innocuos textures give way too a much harder edge, as shuffling, two-step rhythms join with a ragged bassline and pitch bent melodies.</p>\n<p>The tracks darker, tougher elements are exploited with more vigour through other tracks such as ‘Still Seas/Just Mortal’ whereby murky drones and surreal atmospherics patiently build before giving way to a feverish, Garage style sway.</p>\n<p>Title track ‘Margosa Heights’ also keeps a footing in the fruitful early 2000s Garage/Dubstep crossover period, as a warped bassline is joined by stumbling kicks and a dusty, off-beat hi-hat pattern. Despite some of the tracks more gristled textures, blissful, soporific melodies also make staggered appearances throughout the track, and are a feature more widely exploited through closer ‘Hebridean Mind Tours’.</p>\n<p>Aquatic bleeps and blips bubble beneath a slowly developing arpeggio, which is augmented with rumbling bass tones and glitchy percussion around the midpoint.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F93348978&amp;secret_token=s-Vxg4f\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

As always their latest release is completely unchained by past output, coming from ambient craftsman Ben Lukas Boysen, often better known as Hecq.</p>\n<p>Here however, we see Boysen releasing under his real name, and given the album’s departure from the droning, electronic soundscapes and off-the-wall Dubstep of his work as Hecq, this seems like a good decision. Centring around reflective piano work and drawn out atmospheres, the album has as much a common reference to Hauschka or Nils Frahm as it does to the likes of Tim Hecker or Fennesz, with whom the Hecq project was often referenced in context with.</p>\n<p><em>Gravity</em> should certainly not be taken as a track-by-track type of album, as each track gently flows into the next. The tender, emotionally charged melodies of ‘Nocturne1’, or following track ‘To The Hills’, wouldn’t sound out of place soundtracking Danny Boyle’s Sunshine, due to their ethereal, transcendental atmospheres. ‘Nocturne 1’ is particularly powerful, and warrants significant attention even as a standalone track. Sweeping, and highly cinematic, the track slowly builds to a climax, with the introduction of downtempo drums and powerful washes of synthesiser.</p>\n<p>It is interesting how <em>Gravity’s</em> midpoint seems to signify a drop in energy rather than an increase as would be expected, as tracks ‘You’ll Miss Us One Day’ and ‘Eos’ strip away Boysen’s already subtle atmospheres, leaving gentle, haunting piano as the central focus.</p>\n<p>Boysen’s output seems to have been rather sparse over the last few years, and it is interesting how _Gravity _retains certain elements characteristic of his productions, whilst also shaking free of other conventions and idiosyncrasies. In essence, I would argue that the album signifies a refining of his sound, and I for one am certainly looking forward to seeing where this new direction takes him in the future.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F94129274&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Arpegis runs Athen-based Modular Expansion, another fine outpost of European Techno, the diversity of which is well exemplified on <em>Ekhowax</em>, which traverses minimal, Dub-Techno, melodic turns, and harder strains of the genre. Modular Expansion as a label is a new creation, but there’s nothing naïve about it – Apergis has been putting on events under the name for fifteen years, and so he brings to the label a certain meticulousness that only develops after a prolonged exposure to a certain sound. Despite this being the fourth release of the year, the label is extremely well curated with each pick feeling measured, my personal favourite being Homme’s elegant LP <em>Realization for the Ear.</em> Apergis has enlisted a small group of extras including Birth of Frequency and Truncate for <em>Ekhowax,</em> which suggests that while the label has mainly been a conduit for his own releases, Modular Expansion tells a story which Apergis can’t tell alone.</p>\n<p>Apergis’s press release claims that Ekhowax ‘expands the artists‘ club vision of his early Detroit releases into a Dub-Techno territory’, and such a synopsis is hard to argue with. The original’s plush textures recall the perfectionism of Robert Henke’s releases as Monolake, and the vocal snippet could have been plucked straight from a Planet E or Minus release. While NX1’s remix emphasises the dubbier end of things, it stills carries the propulsion of the original and doesn’t slip into the meditative mood that characterizes much Dub-Techno. It’s a bit formulaic on its own, but it has enough energy to work within a DJ set and by no means seriously compromises the quality of the release. Birth of Frequency’s mix is a few more steps away from the original, overdubbing a basic framework (for much of the track just a 4/4 kick) with what sounds like a futuristic church organ solo. It’s the sort of techno that you could listen to for hours, music which ought to soundtrack the tunnel of lights scene towards the end of Kubrick’s <em>2001</em>, with the slowly mutating arpeggio accompanied by percussion which is occasionally either added to or subtracted from.</p>\n<p>However pick of the remixes is the one closest to the original. Truncate’s rework gives the kick drum a tremendous bounce, and again grants prominence to the vocal snippet whilst giving it an extra sense of urgency. On a pair of bedroom monitors the bass frequencies hurl themselves at you and force their way into your torso. It’s quite remarkable, and I’d be happy to hear the stripped back final minute - where the forceful percussion is cut loose from the shackles of tonality - last a lot longer.</p>\n<p>12”s comprising a single track and a collection of remixes can often feel like a raw deal and at worst a commercial tactic, but given Apergis’s prolific output this year it’d be hard to accuse him of laziness. Anyway, each remix here is a solid tool, with Truncate’s in particular deserving merit as a standalone achievement.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F98215089\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Album releases from Stroboscopic Artefact’s have always proved worthy of our attention. The label approaches the format with care and consideration, always seeking to release work pushing the borders of Techno, blurring the lines between club music and home listening. The latest in the series comes from a new project, ‘Zeitgeiber’, made up of Stroboscopic label boss Luca Mortellaro, &amp; all round Techno veteran Jochem Paap, better known as Speedy J.</p>\n<p>With the self-titled album receiving glowing review since its release on the 10th, we were graced with the rare opportunity of catching up with the pair to discuss amongst other things, Zeitgeber and its origins.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: So first off how did you both meet, and at what point did you decide to start working together?</strong></p>\n<p>J: Before we met in person we knew <em>of</em> each other obviously. With Electric Deluxe we run events around the world, but our residency club is in Amsterdam. So at some point we asked Luca to play for us and what I sometimes do, and also did in this case was to ask some of the performers to stay for an extra day or two, or come a little bit early so we can hang out and maybe hit the studio. So that was what we did. We played Queens night I believe two years ago at The Milky Way in Amsterdam, and he stayed a few extra days, came back with me to Rotterdam and we decided to do some work in the studio. When you put two people in the studio who don’t really know each other that well, anything can happen. Anything from awkward silences and polite conversation to something that ends up being really productive. That’s exactly what happened with Luca – basically we shut the door in the studio and a couple of hours after that we had a couple of ideas for tracks! Everything went really fast. We didn’t talk that much we just hit it off really well in the studio and we had a really fast workflow, so decided to not just stick with one idea but meet again afterwards to put everything into a larger structure, and actually do an album.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: I guess one of the benefits of not having met up before is that if your meeting up in the studio thats what your there for, so theres nothing else distracting you.</strong></p>\n<p>J: Well you know, I’ve done a lot of collaborations and there’s no real way to predict what is going to happen. Sometimes it looks good on paper and it turns out really crap and other times you have no expectations and things go really fast you know! Any variety in between those extremes can also happen but in this case it went really well.</p>\n<p>L: I mean very often it can happen when people collaborate for something, they collaborate with a specific purpose – ‘I am doing this, you are doing that so lets do this…’</p>\n<p>J: And then it will be a hit!</p>\n<p>(Laughs)</p>\n<p>L: With Jochem this never happened you know, I literally got from Amsterdam to Rotterdam into the studio – not much talk, ‘Hi, how are you? Lets have a coffee and stuff, show me the machines and stuff’, and then we started doing the album. It was completely spontaneous.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: So did you know you wanted the project to be an album before you started work on it?</strong></p>\n<p>L: Not at the beginning. As Jochem said this is something he very often does with artists that play for his events – inviting them to the studio to have some fun with no pre-planned ideas. At the beginning after we had been working for two hours we said yeah this can work, we have a very fast workflow together and the ideas were coming into a sound shape very nicely, so after I think just the second day we realised that we were composing such a palette of sounds that an EP would not be enough for it, so we started challenging ourselves with the album architecture. Challenging is a bad word for this since it was a very effortless album! It came very naturally, and from the feedback we’ve got from many people, it’s something that you can clearly listen how effortless it was - as much as a flow of consciousness if you know what I mean. When we had enough for us, we said enough and started closing the tracks one after the other and then when it was over it was over we just said the album is done.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3671/9167555614_e71e0fc592_m.jpg\" alt=\"SALP001\"></p>\n<p>J: The other thing, I think really early on in the process, the first three tracks were so much apart from each other we though ok if we can span such a range doing music together we should really do more, because otherwise its going to end up sounding really detached. By doing more tracks we also found out where our common ground eventually was, and because the first three were the most apart from each other of all the tracks we’ve done together, we kind of filled the gaps afterwards you know. Not without a plan, but it was still very spontaneous and really natural. It didn’t feel like a complete body of work when we did the first session.</p>\n<p>L: I think I would like to add something because of course when you collaborate, you sometimes have different perceptions of the thing. For me those three tracks that Jochem is mentioning, they were very different from each other but for me going in the album direction was because I was feeling not so much about filling the gaps as Jochem says, but mostly because I was feeling they were the three extreme points of something bigger - so it was the completing of a drawing you know.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: So was all the work done in the studio together or did you spend time sending ideas between each other?</strong></p>\n<p>L: No, mainly we met in person at the real production stage we were working all the time together either in Jochem’s studio in Rotterdam, or my own studio in Berlin. After, when it was about mixdowns and mastering – all the post-production things we of course were sending over .wav files. One thing that for me was also pretty important was to avoid lets say, ‘internet production’ while we were producing the sounds in the album. Even the way our production system works, it wouldn’t have been possible. It was too much of a, in an earlier interview Jochem said, like a battle you know. It was so interactive that at that distance, via the internet, a different album would have come out.</p>\n<p>J: It would have killed it. The actual writing of the tracks - basically the entire structure, sound design, content and everything was created really quickly actually. I think we didn’t spend more time actually laying down the tracks than a week you know. We did two or three days in my studio and two or three days in Luca’s studio, and we saved all the stuff as it came out and worried about labelling and the mixdowns and technical stuff later. We didn’t do any technical stuff when we were together, we were just bouncing ideas off each other.</p>\n<p>L: I think the reason for this was not because we said ‘lets do it like <em>this </em>for example’, it was because again the way we find each other producing together was telling us that the time between an idea going from your mind to the sound was so fast with Jochem, it would have been a shame to loose that kind of energy. The main constitutional energy lets say. First, lets use this very productive flow we have together, lets put all the ideas down and whatever comes, lets just record record record and then we think about the quality of sound – compressions and stuff like this, mixdowns and mastering after. First off, lets sort out the heart of the thing.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: Being in the studio together did you get to use a lot of hardware on the album? I know Luca you’ve recently set up ‘Philsynth’, so is that something that tied in?</strong></p>\n<p>L: I mean yeah, Philsynth is something much more recent – in fact when this synthesiser shop thing came about the album was already finished. We were already in the mastering process, but of course I do have a very strong love for hardware machines you know. The album I think was very hybrid. There was a lot of recording from very nice machines. For me, I still remember when I first got into Jochem’s studio I was like ‘wow this is kind of your playground’ you know? So it was pretty interesting because some of the machines that Jochem has in the studio, it the first time I had a chance to touch them. That was very important because when you touch them for the first time you have a different approach to when you know them well. You fuck around with stuff much more. I think that even the palette of sound was very hybrid; part of it was very digital based, part of it was from hardware sources, so I think mainly the arrangement and things like this came from digital workstations, like Ableton Live and things like this. But lets say 50% of the sound palette was coming from hardware and 50% from digital I guess.</p>\n<p>J: I think that’s about right.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: So do you think its the sort of thing you could adapt to a live show? I know you did Boiler Room as Zeitgeber recently.</strong></p>\n<p>L: Actually that was a back to back DJ set. For a live thing we’ve been thinking about it, but the problem is living in two different cities makes it very hard to do it properly. The last thing we want is a ‘push play and go’ kind of live act you know, but if we were doing this we were about to bring machines on stage and things to make a real performance. Time wise – both me and Jochem are very busy and <em>mainly</em> living in two different cities makes it almost impossible, so we decided to select just a few venues for our sets, when the circumstances are really right to do these back to back DJ sets.</p>\n<p>J: Yeah I mean we both agreed that if we were going to do a live show we would do it in the mood and according to the nature of the project, which was very much based on doing things on the fly instead of pre-programming everything. As Luca said it would have been a monstrous job to put a show like that together for just a couple of gigs. We both have a very full calender and have other projects running, so we needed to decided you know, if we’re going to do a tour with this we’ll have enough arsenal of stuff that we would never play as individual DJs, but we will cover the common ground that we have in Zeitgeber. So we decided to base our gigs on more of a DJ kind of thing, which is going to be different from what we do as individual performers anyway, so we have a lot of things to figure out and play around with and also the stuff that we use. We both use Traktor with four decks and other machines and controllers and things. There’s still a lot of room to move around, to be very spontaneous and to improvise on the fly which I think is quite essential to the collaboration.</p>\n<p>L: We did that Boiler Room because there was no preparation, or tests at all. Even technical wise we had half an hour of sound check over there, but we never prepared anything for it so everything is pretty nicely tied up together. I think there is a very good harmony, and I had no doubts about it because it is very usual for us to spend time in the studio that way, so why not play?</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F95766326\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>SL: When I watched it it took me a while to work out that you were doing a DJ set rather than a live performance, so that’s probably a good sign!</strong></p>\n<p>L: Yeah it was very very multilayered, so thats why most of it you can’t really recognise the tracks. It was more taking something from here and something from there, and for me its good when you see how nice the flow is. That was a really nice gig, i’m still very satisfied with it.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: I think as you say the sound palette you were working with really fits in with what you’re produced for the album.</strong></p>\n<p>L: Yeah, in a more club-oriented way, but yes. The Boiler Room Berlin its a party you know. You have a lot of people dancing, you have a Funktion One soundsystem, the place is a club you know! We kind of naturally adapted what we did with the album to that ambience.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: Both being label owners, do you think you give yourselves very high standards to reach? Do you exercise a lot of quality control when releasing your own work?</strong></p>\n<p>J: I don’t think its necessarily related to running a label you know. In this case - at least in my case, when I do music the only standard for me is whether I like it or not you know. I don’t really have any targets I feel I need to achieve in terms of quality, or sound design you know, its just whatever sounds good to me at the time that I produce it, that makes it onto the label you know. The label wasn’t really a criteria because we didn’t have a plan to do an album in the first place, and then when we finished the album we didn’t have any idea where to release it. We’ve also thought about releasing it on a third party label because we didn’t want to deal with all the label stuff basically. But in the end Luca decided he was interested in doing it on Stroboscopic, so that’s why we decided to do it there.</p>\n<p>L: I totally agree with what Jochem said about the story, but there is one thing in general about the label arrangement that I think we are very different, because Jochem was saying ‘my standard is whether I like it or not’. For me I have to confess that sometimes I release things that are not pleasant to my ears. I have this vision that I don’t always want to please people, sometimes something is very disturbing and for me that’s the point you know what I mean.</p>\n<p>J: Oh yeah there is enough pleasant music around you know. The world needs more unpleasant music.</p>\n<p>(Laughs)</p>\n<p>L: Sometimes you need to disturb people to wake them up.</p>\n<p>J: Yeah all those fucking crowd pleasers!</p>\n<p>(Laughs)</p>\n<p><strong>SL: Could I ask you both what your plans are with Stroboscopic and Electric Deluxe? What can people expect for the rest of the year from both the labels?</strong></p>\n<p>J: For me, Electric Deluxe is a label but we also have an event series. We host stages at festivals and we do club events basically around the world, and that’s pretty much always tied into what we do with the label. The people that are releasing on our label are usually also part of the bill when we do events. We’ve got quite a few new people coming to the label in the next couple of months, and we’ve basically already scheduled up everything – all the releases up until the end of the year. We’ll do a stage at Mysteryland again, we’ll have a really nice thing going on at ADE again this year. I’m not going to reveal who’s signed to the label in terms of new releases, but there’s some new younger guys who are doing interesting stuff from Germany as well as the UK so i’m looking forward to getting them out on the label. So yeah, we’re pretty full, it’s pretty hectic.</p>\n<p>L: Jochem I’m still enjoying that Alva Noto remix on Electric Deluxe that he did recently!</p>\n<p>J: Oh <em>thankyou</em> Luca!</p>\n<p>(Laughs)</p>\n<p>L: Regarding Stroboscopic actually we are focussing very much on developing the Monad series this summer, there are quite a few interesting new entries. I can reveal the first one which is not really a new entry because we introduced them to the label through a remix that they did for Dadub’s album, which is Lakker. Then there will be another two Monad releases and then after the summer a few EPs. I’m also actually preparing my next solo album after my own 2011 <em>Wordplay For Worker Bees </em>which is taking a while already. I was even producing stuff for this while we were working on Zeitgeber and so it’s quite a long process but I’m almost there I think, so maybe end of this year maybe the beginning of next. Then there are some follow ups from Dadub after their album, so yeah that’s how we roll it!</p>\n<p><strong>SL: Cool! I guess this album’s only just come out so you might not be thinking about it yet, but do you have plans to produce more together in the future?</strong></p>\n<p>L: I think you said it right we haven’t talked about it yet! It’s still to fresh and as a process the mood of the album was to not pre-plan anything - that’s how we’re going to continue our relationship I guess. We don’t want to structure it to much, so if at the point we really feel we want to sit down again in the studio because we have something else to say, we’re going to do it for sure, otherwise not. Jochem do you agree?</p>\n<p>J: Yeah nothing planned, so yeah we’ll see!</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F91565812\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7383/9172355475_34e80dac3e_t.jpg\" alt=\"PS4\"></p>\n<p><strong>Label:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.mote-evolver.com/\">Mote-Evolver</a><br>\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> 12”/Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 01/07/13</p>\n<p>Mote-Evolver is one of those labels that seems utterly incapable of releasing mediocre music, with each release being exceptionally curated. Psyk’s Arcade EP was a runaway success last month and it certainly seems fitting that the label have grabbed two more producers who have had an impeccable run over the last year. Here at Stray Landings we are big fans of Developer and Truncate, having reviewed their releases more than once and when we saw that Mote-Evolver had snapped the pair up for their ‘Parallel Series’ we were excited to say the least.</p>\n<p>The ‘Parallel Series’ is somewhat set apart from the rest of label, in ethos at least. This run of records is kept exclusively for split EPs, with the concept being for the artists featured to ‘contrast and compliment’ each other. To be perfectly honest we have had reservations about multi artist Eps in the past, where only too often dodgy curation and running order have left the offerings sounding a little incoherent. While the rest of the ‘Parallel Series’ has tended to stand above this assumption with personal highlights coming from Shifted and Samuel Kemppi’s contribution last year, the series hasn’t delivered a pairing that seems to have really lived up to an interesting contrast and comparison, until now! The pairing of the two West Coast producers is inspired. Their close friendship and professional collaborations is in sharp contrast to the differences in style they deliver on the EP, making for truly interesting listening as well as plenty of dance floor clout.</p>\n<p>Beginning with ‘Random Attractions’ we get a typically macho piece of distorted, driving Techno that Developer does so well. It is perhaps straighter and more clearly aimed at the dance floor than usual, with a hypnotic chord pattern fighting its way to the forefront for most of the track before being given full reign at the four minute mark. ‘Drive Themes’ leaves the distorted atmospheres and reverbs behind and gets straight to point with an almost atonal stab sequence relentlessly pushing its way throughout the entire six minutes. This is where Developer and Truncate’s sound seems to intersect most directly, because while Truncate’s ‘Fourty Four’ is more sparse than ‘Drive Themes’ they both exhibited a rolling low end and slinky synth work that seems to be a sound share by the two Americans.</p>\n<p>Truncate’s ‘Is It Skinny’ is a great cut, with a pointed, repetitive synth line working  the listener into a trance like state. Having said that, while Truncate’s golden moments such as ‘Concentrate’ and ‘Modify’ have made heavy use of the repetitive vocal refrain, the ‘Is It Skinny’ repetition feels slightly out of place. Its position in the mix and filtered presence is expertly done, but ultimately the best parts of the track are when the vocal falls away. One of the marked differences between Developer and Truncate is that Developer rarely resorts to such tropes, or at least not as frequently as Truncate seems too. ‘Forty Four’ leaves the vocal gimmicks behind and see’s Truncate operate at a faster BPM than usual to staggering effect. The slinking synth line and typically razor sharp percussion shows off Truncate’s minimalism at its best. The track is short and sweet and is aimed firmly at the dance floor, where it will be welcomed with open arms.</p>\n<p>All in all the fourth outing of the ‘Parallel Series’ see’s its most interesting incarnation. The geographical closeness of the artists, as well as their artistic similarities makes for really interesting listening especially with the focus being on the listener’s ability to ‘compare and contrast’ the records. If Mote-Evolver continue to place artists which are perhaps closer together in terms of their positions in the scene, both geographically and artistically then the conceptual focus of this series will continue to become more solid. Considering the fact that, this is a conceptual record in an albeit subtle way, it is also characteristic of Mote-Evolver that it would be just so bloody danceable and perfectly at home in a club environment. Long may it continue!</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F98218901\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Chris Jarman has had a rather lengthy career, having released music since the early 2000s under the alias Raiden. Whilst he was also working with Industrial, Trip Hop &amp; Techno in his formative years, it was Jarman’s D&amp;B tunes that came to dominate the Raiden moniker. “The D&amp;B tunes tunes I made were snapped up by a big label very quickly, so that pretty much took over my life, yet my D&amp;B material has remained highly Techno influenced.” Jarman says of his releases as Raiden. “It got to a point where I wanted to go back and do something I didn’t necessarily have the chance to do before, midlife production crisis maybe?”</p>\n<p>The so called ‘midlife production crisis’ Jarman mentions has come in the form of a rebranding of his output, and July sees the second offering from his most recent pseudonym ‘Kamikaze Space Programme’ out on West Norwood Cassette Library. “When the first KSP release came out in late 2011 Bob [WNCL] instantly supported me and we have been talking ever since.” he considers of the releases formation. “He’s very patient &amp; particular about what he puts out, so it took almost a year to get this release together, but he brought the best out of me.”</p>\n<p>Those who have heard previews of the forthcoming EP will certainly agree the release has been worth the wait, highlighting Jarman’s deftness at re-contextualising samples. “Everytime you hear the sound it takes you back to when you recorded it and a mental image of an object/situation that produced the sound, you’ve frozen that moment in time.” he explains. “It’s interesting to see people dancing to a track that’s made entirely from loose change that was in my pocket for example, you’ve taken sounds you wouldn’t normally regard in the context of dance music, yet it’s the things we hear in everyday life.”</p>\n<p>The mix Jarman has put together for us covers plenty of affront new KSP material, comfortably placing it alongside offerings from his contemporaries such Clouds and Boner M. “I was aiming for a mix of crunchy music full of texture and harmonics” he adds. “I recorded the mix using Ableton live using Push and various midi controllers, a sampler acting as a drum machine and a delay FX unit all on the fly.”</p>\n<p>Keep an eye out for the Kamikaze Space Programme EP on WNCL over this month, and also expect to see an EP for TRUST under the byname in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Bloodman // Views [DecaRhythm]</li>\n<li>1DERL&amp; &amp; Kamikaze Space Programme // Piriparas [Unreleased]</li>\n<li>MPIA3 // Casual Welding [Avian]</li>\n<li>Kamikaze Space Programme // Radio [Unreleased]</li>\n<li>Clouds // Krafterah [Turbo Recordings]</li>\n<li>Kamikaze Space Programme // Battery [WNCL]</li>\n<li>Ed Chamberlain // Landline [Unreleased]</li>\n<li>Kamikaze Space Programme // HSBC [Unreleased]</li>\n<li>Kamikaze Space Programme // Pyongyang [WNCL]</li>\n<li>Aphex Twin // Window Licker (Acid Edit) [Warp]</li>\n<li>Groove Armada // Pull Up (WNCL Remix) [Hypercolour]</li>\n<li>Kamikaze Space Programme // Loose Change [WNCL]</li>\n<li>Paul Mac // Grand Statement [Unreleased]</li>\n<li>Manni Dee // Romatic Self [Black Sun Records]</li>\n<li>Caustic Window // Schmart [Unreleased]</li>\n<li>Boner M // Poke [Pennyroyal]</li>\n<li>Wishmountain // Nescafe [Accidental]</li>\n<li>Kamikaze Space Programme // Network Rail [WNCL]</li>\n<li>Kamikaze Space Programme // Clapper [Unreleased]</li>\n<li>Ancient Methods // Castling Becomes Inevitable [Ancient Methods]</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/stray-landings-mix-series/id556425050?mt=2\">Subscribe in iTunes</a></p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"132\" src=\"//www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?feed=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0020-kamikaze-space-programme%2F&embed_uuid=3663826d-fcb2-45cd-baac-2412bab390a1&stylecolor=&embed_type=widget_standard\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/0020-kamikaze-space-programme/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=resource_link\">0020 // Kamikaze Space Programme</a> by <a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=profile_link\">Stray Landings</a> on <a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=homepage_link\"> Mixcloud</a></p>\n",

The second in the series follows a fairly similar format, consisting of two tracks from Lopez, and two from Modularz chieftan, Developer.</p>\n<p>Opening with the sinister drive of ‘Let It Be Said’, Developer grounds the EP with cement-like foundations, that hold no reservations for beefy and bold dynamics. Similarly, ‘Madre’ keeps the production crunchy and dense, but this time with a somewhat airy and melodic progression atop the mix.</p>\n<p>However, it is Lopez’s offerings that really stand out on this release, blending dark, mechanical sounds with factory atmospherics, and driving early-hour Techno. Particularly, ‘Lines of Fracture’ opens with an ominous distorted chug, reminiscent of the Radio Slave remix of Len Faki’s classic ‘My Black Sheep’. The way the kick interacts with the high-end percussion is especially interesting, with a phased motif that never seems to come to an end, producing a wonderfully intoxicating rhythm. There are also some delightfully uncomfortable noises surrounding the mix, that feel sticky and detached - like trying to run with chewing gum stuck to your shoes.</p>\n<p>'Sequel', on the other hand, brings to mind Psyk’s darker productions, albeit with an added measure of grit. Clamorous chimes poke out at every available opportunity between assorted hats and warbling, disquieting atmospheres. Again, the quality of the sound has a somewhat restless and unsettled feel about it. This has been achieved somewhat through the subtly placed backdrop of dissonant chords, but also through Lopez’s characteristic scratchy high-end textures that make this EP a stand-out.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F94836263\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

We just released the Developer &amp; Truncate 4th Parallel Series and we’ve planned some more 12” from P.A.S. as well as other artists till the rest of the year.</p>\n<p><strong>Your discography of remixes is pretty impressive - what is it that makes a good remix in your opinion?</strong></p>\n<p>From my perspective as a musician and DJ a remix should have some kind of element that is you, yet keep the main idea of the original track. That being said I’ve always found remixes relatively hard to do or to get right. They either take weeks or a few hours and i usually spend weeks thinking about it then any good result comes in a few hours of work.</p>\n<p><strong>You’re playing at Fabric on the 13th alongside Lucy &amp; Terry Francis, what is it you aim for when playing out, and to what extent does the venue/lineup affect your performance?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes looking forward to heading back to Room 2 as always, on the latter question I think there are a lot of variables that can influence everything on any night but the vibe should be all encompassing and with Lucy and Terry there will be a high quality of music to go with those vibes!</p>\n<p><strong>Finally, as a producer having been at the forefront of Techno for 20+ years, what do you think is the key to staying relevant?</strong></p>\n<p>Stick to the music.

Only a couple of months later and we’ve been graced with the imprints second offering, ‘222’ - consisting of two swampy, oddball, slow House jams. There’s never been any denying the fact that Wadsworth is one of the few producers in the House and Techno game with a truly unique sound, however i’d argue this opinion is especially evident through both the releases on the vinyl-only imprint.</p>\n<p>This said, 222 is no carbon copy of the first release, moving into deeper and darker territories, whilst maintaining the same lumbering yet futuristic vibe of 111. The a-side deploys stumbling kicks and sullen, but powerful lo-fi chords to wonderful atmospheric effect, sauntering between dub-tinged breaks and crunchy, downtempo house-rhythms.</p>\n<p>The b-side on the other hand is significantly more upbeat, despite operating around roughly the same tempo. A rambling bassline leads the track, joined by bouncy off-kilter rhythms and crisp hi-hat work. Jaunty samples constantly verge on displacing the tracks stuttering rhythms, pulling against driving kick drums.</p>\n<p>With the calibre this high, I can’t imagine 222 hanging around much longer than its predecessor - although i’ll probably save myself the embarrassment of asking for a record called Uranus over the counter and order online this time…</p>\n<p>Previews can be heard via Decks <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CD4QFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.decks.de%2Ft%2Fkris_wadsworth-uranus_222%2Fc1k-52&amp;ei=wRK3UarZDsXP0QXSuYHIBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGXw5EotbxSjuIziejagSDwsfIENA&amp;sig2=rm6rSPTgbrK21TiBkIco6w&amp;bvm=bv.47534661,d.d2k\">here</a></p>\n",

Their latest 12” sees no break in pace either, as the duo provide a four track EP for Stroboscopic Artefacts, making up the fourteenth component of the label’s ‘Monad’ series.</p>\n<p>Listening back through Lakker’s previous output, it’s comes as no surprise that they’ve been picked up by the Berlin label - the crossovers in sound between themselves and SA releases are plentiful. This said, the EP does lean as expected, towards the more experimental end of their productions, further developing the pair’s propensity for broken rhythms and celestial melodies.</p>\n<p>Thick, hissing static opens first track ‘Dryad’, a component which recurs throughout the release. These are briefly filtered out before being reintroduced alongside a driving, cinematic bass line and punchy, close-knit percussion.</p>\n<p>‘Nevada’ creates an off kilter, dub tinged break in pace, before proceeding to Monad XIV’s real highlights; the grating, small hours stomp of ‘Asvattha’, and prophetic closer ‘Artificial Weather’.</p>\n<p>Centering around a grating sample reminiscent of a Geiger counter, ‘Asvattha’ slowly works into an evenly paced march, that never quite feels comfortable, despite the introduction of of shuffling hi-hats and toms. Wailing, choral tones make their appearance in the latter half of the track, adding a haunting and detached mood to the track.</p>\n<p>Equally atmospheric, ‘Artificial Weather’ makes use of a melancholic chord progression, drawn-out over distorted layers of static and crunchy rhythms. As the track builds to a climax, the cloying atmospheres are suddenly cut, leaving powerful droning chords laid bare.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F99620966\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Many live shows feature visual elements at least to some degree, however few electronic musicians give visual media as much credence as London based Zan Lyons. Having fallen in love with the art of cinematography, Lyons’ music is inextricably linked to the visual elements which make up his live performances, clips of which are triggered and processed live, soundtracked by gritty, hardcore tinged percussion and atmospheric, processed strings.</p>\n<p>With a performance for Contort’s day at Atonal festival on Sunday, We caught up with Zan to discuss his influences, and how visuals inform his music and vice-versa.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you get involved in Contort/Atonal?</strong></p>\n<p>I met Sam and Hayley a few months before the first one and they asked me to play. I loved it so much I asked to play at the next one. This will be my fourth Contort!</p>\n<p><strong>Who else are you looking forward to seeing play at the festival?</strong></p>\n<p>The entire lineup is incredible! Highlights for me would be Samuel Kerridge and Russell Haswell.</p>\n<p><strong>The prospect of performing in a power-plant seems quite befitting of your sound palette, how much do you think setting affects your performances?</strong></p>\n<p>Hugely! There’s a great deal of improvisation in my shows so I always respond to the environment I’m Playing in.</p>\n<p><strong>As an A/V artist, how important do you think music is to dictating the context of a film?</strong></p>\n<p>In terms of my own work, I work symbiotically on both so the tend to influence each other. In terms of feature films, music and sound design are half the film. When done well, the music acts as another character driving the narrative.</p>\n<p><strong>I have heard you say in interviews that film-making was your first love. How did you get into making music and was your music linked to working with film when you started out?</strong></p>\n<p>Film was definitely my first love but I was actually a musician for years before I ever picked up a camera. As a teenager in London in the early 90’s hearing the early rave records was literally life-changing! People only a few years older than me were making these incredible sounds with minimal equipment in their bedrooms. It showed me that it was even possible to make this music myself. It was hugely inspiring.</p>\n<p><strong>How does your live set up work in terms of editing both music and visuals live? Do you use programs like Max MSP a lot? When writing, do you usually start with visuals and write music after or vice-versa?</strong></p>\n<p>I use Ableton Live a midi pedal and a small controller keyboard. My process is more like live editing than traditional VJing. I need complete control over all the elements so nothing is generative. I use Ableton’s built in Looper for my Viola and I map keys and pads to Visual cues and sound elements. It’s all live so I have freedom to vary shows.</p>\n<p><strong>Who do you admire in terms of other visual artists?</strong></p>\n<p>Andrew Huang has some great work. There’s an incredible comic book artist in the UK called Jase Daniels. Czech painter Jan Saudek is amazing. I love what the Light Surgeons do with live documentary.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally what are your plans for the rest of 2013?</strong></p>\n<p>Finishing my long-form audio/release. I’m completing the post work on the images at the moment so shouldn’t be too much longer.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F15745417\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Gravite records appeared almost out of nowhere last year with three brilliant EPs from Bruno Sacco, Franck Valat and Danilo Rispoli – all of which sustain a ‘no nonsense’, commitment to functional, stripped-down progressive techno. In terms of sound, Gravite prefer delicate balance to raw power, and sleek production over crude brutalism. Their fourth EP, <em>Ontology</em>, comes from Coal, a.k.a Giovanni Paris, and falls tremendously into this tradition.</p>\n<p>Given the EP’s intense visual quality and vividness, it is perhaps unsurprising that Paris’ main musical experience comes from the world of TV, film and advertising. However, what may be surprising is that this is his first techno release, purely because it is pulled off so well. Of course, on the one hand, there is plenty of overlap; title track ‘Ontology’, for instance, has an enormously cavernous ambience to it, and one can imagine that Paris has gained a lot of practice in this field from working with visual media. Nevertheless, the punchy drive and the intricate dynamic development is not something that we find in his previous work, and in my opinion makes this release more distinctive.</p>\n<p>Bruno Sacco’s remix also manages to keep things distant and intriguing, never once being too brazen or abrasive. Instead, the interest is kept through subtle manipulations of textures, and enormous swathes of noise that wash over the mix every now and again.</p>\n<p>'Potassio' closes the EP, going deeper into the industrial underbelly (or <em>Coal-mine</em>, if you like) of Paris’ sound. Although it is certainly less of a standalone track than ‘Ontology’, it isn’t meant to be, and it’s interesting to hear just how well Paris is able to create those weird and wonderful blasts of sound that hover above the track like an ominous cloud.</p>\n<p>There are of course parallels to be drawn here – the likes of Puresque and Oliver Deutschmann come to mind - but this should certainly not be a deterrent, as the EP sounds far from derivative. Personally, I hope Paris continues to develop his Coal moniker, intermingling his cinematic work with this new club-oriented sound, and create something altogether unique.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/V26c1gn-VWg\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Exium are a Spanish techno duo consisting of Valentín Corujo and Héctor Sandoval. Having released records for over 11 years, as well as starting their own label, Nheoma, it’s fair to say that Exium are now a powerhouse in the world of electronic music.</p>\n<p>Their latest album, _A Sensible Alternative to Emotion, _stands out for me as one of the best releases of 2013 so far. The whole thing is incredibly strong from start to finish - blending the guttural, muscular club sound that Exium are so deservedly well-known for, with some fascinating abstract pieces littered along the way. Unlike many attempts made by techno producers to move to the album format, <em>A Sensible Alternative to Emotion</em> really feels like a considered, complete piece of work. There are plenty of nuggets here to keep you hooked; from the jaw-clenching <em>Absolute Magnitude</em> to the glorious closer _The 12th Planet _to name but two.</p>\n<p>We had the wonderful opportunity to catch up with Exium about the album, playing live, and the Spanish techno scene as a whole.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: So how have things been since your album came out?</strong></p>\n<p>Things have been great. We are pleased with how the album has been received. It was quite different from what we usually produce and we did not know what would happen. However, we have received positive feedback and good reviews.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: How did the process differ to the making of your first album, Roots of Time?</strong></p>\n<p>Basically, the process and approach was the same. The main difference being that we looked at the tracks from other perspectives and not just thinking about being played_._</p>\n<p>**SL: With contrast to Roots of Time, that was more like a collection of 12”s, do you think it be fair to say this album is really your first ‘conceptual’ release? Do you plan to make more of these full length LPs in the future? **</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7354/9437446358_633ac2239e_m.jpg\" alt=\"Exium\"></p>\n<p>Yes definitely, this is more an album to listen to as a whole, from beginning to end. While we were working on it and finishing tracks we could see what other kind of tracks we needed to complete the idea we had in mind. In the future we will make different albums but we liked the idea of doing it as a whole and not just a set of songs. It’s too soon to say how that will sound at the moment.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: If you’ll excuse my impatience, how come it took over 10 years from your debut EP to release a full length album? Was the album format simply something that you weren’t interested in or were you just more keen to release music for clubs?</strong></p>\n<p>Actually, by 2005 we had already written our first album but the distribution company closed. We eventually put the tracks out on some 12”and some were released on other labels. After that, we did not see a need to release an album, because our music was more focused on clubs. We have always done a lot of work for other labels so in 2011 we decided to stop and dedicate more time to nheoma and work on an album with the characteristic Exium sound and incorporating all of our work in the last 10 years.</p>\n<p>**SL: The new album has a couple of interesting, more ambient pieces on it, that stray slightly from the sounds you usually make - I’m thinking in particular of Dronid and Dagma. Are these tracks representative of something you would like to do more of? **</p>\n<p>These tracks are 100% a reflection of the spirit of the album and can be described as our discourse in different clothes. These tracks actually reflect the soul that we always put in to our tracks from a more liberal approach and without the tyranny that can be imposed by club music.</p>\n<p>**SL: The artwork for your new album is intriguing. Can you tell us a bit about your thinking behind it and who designed it? **</p>\n<p>The artwork was created and designed by Marcos Leiras. We gave him total freedom to come up with something. We just asked for a minimalist, uncomplicated design. He sent us several designs and this was the one we liked most.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: I understand you have played ‘Live/DJ’ sets. Can you tell us a little more about what this involves, what equipment you use and the music you play? How do live sets compare to DJ sets - which do you prefer and why?</strong></p>\n<p>V: We use two Macbooks, Faderfox controllers and a drum machine. In a DJ set format we play alone and I mainly play tracks from other producers and some own tracks. In our live set we play together and mix tracks from other producers along with all of our own stuff, including unreleased tracks…Also, we add new parts, loops etc on the fly. Both kind of sets are fun and interesting, but we prefer to play together and this makes the trips a lot more entertaining.</p>\n<p>H: The best part of a DJ set is that we can play music from other artists. Lately I’ve been playing a lot of our recent stuff and unreleased tracks (that will be released in the coming months). DJ’ing is fun because I think a DJ set is more flexible and allows you to vary the music you play, but it’s still better to play together.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: Can you tell us a bit about how the writing works between you two? Is it a case of working individually and presenting ideas to the other, or do you have distinct roles in Exium?</strong></p>\n<p>We do not have a default way of working. We have our own studios and work on parts separately then exchange the ideas or we can spend an afternoon working together on a track. We always work on the final development of the track and apply the finishing touches together in one of the two studios.</p>\n<p>**SL: Do you think there is a distinct sound to Spanish techno? Is there anyone in particular who you like at the moment? **</p>\n<p>We do not think there is a specific sound that can be classified as Spanish techno as such, but there are a lot of people doing interesting things. At the moment it seems to be that most national artists are recording for other labels and running their own labels. We do not think there is a connection between the sounds of these producers with what we do in Polegroup for example, as to label it as Spanish techno. In Pole, we make modern techno without losing sight of the past and we’ve been doing this for many years. In 10 years we will still be doing this music, incorporating the obvious nuances of the passage of time and the technological changes too. There were many producers in Spain who were making that type of music several years ago and then they stopped. We do not really know what others producers will be doing in the future, but we know what we will be doing in Polegroup.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: What are your plans for the rest of the year? Any up and coming projects you can tell us about?</strong></p>\n<p>The new Nheoma release is ready and is a split EP with Kwartz, a young producer from Madrid. We also have some remixes and collaborations lined up with Pfirter, Developer and Perc Trax. By the end of year there will be a new Polegroup with remixes of the album.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F84823608\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Ten years ago it would have been near impossible to gain entry to the monumental power station on Köpenicker Strasse in Berlin’s Mitte, as the building originally created to power East Berlin after the installation of the Berlin Wall stood abandoned for many years. In 2007 however, Dimitri Hegemann, founder of Berlin’s world famous Tresor club and label, re-awakened part of the building as the new home for Tresor, after the club was forced out of its original dwelling on Leipziger Strasse, where it had been an international Mecca for techno since the early 90s. Since then, the rest of the space has been opened up as ‘Kraftwerk Berlin’, and used for a multitude of artistic events; one of these being Hegemann’s own Atonal Festival, which returned to the city this year after a 23 year absence.</p>\n<p>Originally held in Kreuzberg’s legendary club and venue SO36, Atonal hosted industrial and experimental music, as well as being a cornerstone of Berlin’s underground arts scene, with acts such as Einstürzende Neubauten and Test Department playing at the festival before it ended in 1990 with the fall of the Wall. Needless to say, Kraftwerk provides a more than adequate environment for Atonal’s resurrection – the cavernous building being perfectly suited to the blend of industrial edged experimental music and gritty warehouse techno taking up the bulk of Atonal 2013’s bill. Coming more than two decades since the last edition, it was only fitting that some updates be made to the festival’s sound, with organiser Paulo Reacho describing the re-booted festival as being “not so much about confrontation, but rather about exploration”. The hallmarks of industrial and post-punk which characterised the festival’s original billings were still present however, despite re-contextualisation from the somewhat dank surrounds of SO36 to a jaw-droppingly vast power plant.</p>\n<p>The use of the space as an arts venue feels like a real triumph for values of recycling and re-use, and a real affirmation of the beauty and use-value to be found in an industrially developed society’s forgotten and oft-unloved spaces. Even the most ambitious architect given carte-blanche to design a setting for the music and installations presented at Atonal would never come up with such an astounding venue, with the main hall being reminiscent of Berghain’s huge main chamber, only several times larger. Hegemann’s bold choice of venue demanded bold performances, with nowhere to hide in such a capacious and daunting setting.</p>\n<p>Of the six days, Sunday’s proceedings looked most likely to deliver such bold performances, with a Blackest Ever Black label showcase following an afternoon hosted by not-for-profit event series Contort. Contort, usually held in Kreuzberg’s Mindpirates, aims to give its artists total freedom to explore the most experimental ends of their work; and this manifesto was certainly clear on the day – during Russell Haswell’s opening half an hour many in the audience had their hands clasped firmly over their ears, as Haswell produced piercing sirens and grating analogue noise. As the set progressed he slowly worked in cuttingly sparse Alva Noto style rhythms, giving the seemingly unfocused and slightly indulgent introduction context.</p>\n<p>A mediation between the danceable and the experimental remained present throughout the event - Samuel Kerridge slowly easing out hissing, hi-end percussion and throbbing kicks from dense, foggy atmospheres and rumbling bass drones. More than anyone, Kerridge provided the most fitting soundtrack to the Kraftwerk venue, creating a soundscape that sounded at times as though it could have been an amplified recording of the power station whilst it was operational.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3739/9463938723_3b675abf5d_z.jpg\" alt=\"Atonal\"></p>\n<p>Visuals also played a key role throughout through Contort’s session, as Audiovisual artist Zan Lyons presented his gritty blend of UK Hardcore tinged rhythms and cinematic ambience, syncing his own clear cut visuals live to the music. For the most part the visual element worked well throughout the rest of the evening, with grainy footage reminiscent of the work of 29th Nov films, well suited the industrial edged sound pallate.</p>\n<p>This said, it was slightly unnerving to see Violetshaped running a loop of various B-Movie horror scenes, depicting an assortment of women being stalked and attacked by masked killers – the end result feeling like a cheap shock tactic with little thought given to the implications of doing so. Moreover, such accompaniment was unnecessary - Violetshaped’s music is always an intense listening experience, and was amplified by the setting anyway; so gory footage of women being mutilated, rather than make the experience more overwhelming, actually detracted from it and left a slightly sour taste. What exactly Violetshaped were trying to communicate with these visuals we aren’t sure - the performance itself however was fantastic. Rumbling, distorted, relentless and incredibly hard-hitting; yet after Kerridge’s more freeform set, it felt strangely conventional. A common feature among most of the artists performing on the Sunday was the distorted low end that characterised Violetshaped’s set - kick drums that throbbed rather than propelled.</p>\n<p>Following Violetshaped, and continuing that musical motif, was Raime, whose drudgy, slow-motion take on 80s goth, filled the gaping room spectacularly with ominous low-end drones and haunting eastern influenced vocal outcries. The penultimate act was William Bennett performing as Cut Hands. Bennett’s music, despite it’s wild polyrhythms, and despite Bennett’s own dancing, prompted many in the audience to remain seated, evidencing it’s quality as head music just as much as body music. Short sets, early evening performances, and live sets rather than DJ sets, created a more subdued atmosphere than the music presented usually soundtracks; with a crowd willing simply to listen and appreciate the space.</p>\n<p>The final and most powerful performance came from Dominick Fernow, a.k.a. Vatican Shadow whose live set of a collection of recent released material was accompanied by newspaper clippings and photos documenting the media’s presentation of global violence and the ‘War on Terror’. Musically, the set was a confident run through of the various strands of Fernow’s Vatican Shadow project. Although some transitions between tracks felt a little awkward, sounding like pieces were being hastily crossfaded, this in the end didn’t matter, as Fernow’s overwhelming passion forced a reaction from the audience - go hard or go home. It was not the sort of performance one could submit to half-heartedly, it demanded engagement - not just with the visceral and physically powerful music, but also with the political content. Unless one engages thoroughly with such a performance, the effect can be jarring, and the whole thing can seem frivolous and even humorous. Bennett’s choice of visuals for his Cut Hands set of a silhouette of a naked woman dancing maniacally was a prime example of this odd dichotomy: let go and give way to it and the effect can be powerful and absorbing; but stay on the fringes and retain too much scepticism, and the sight of a man flailing wildly to pseudo-African rhythms in an abandoned power station with an enraptured crowd of onlookers, can be comic.</p>\n<p>Electronic music and dance music can often be accused of lacking content, and the Sunday at Atonal was evidence that electronic music works best when it actually attempts to engage with something. The weaker parts of the programme, such as the comparatively bland Ancient Methods A/V set, and Violetshaped’s ill-thought out imagery, only appeared drab or tasteless juxtaposed with the hyper-political Vatican Shadow or Cut Hand’s cross-cultural collage.</p>\n<p>Given Atonal’s stated mission to explore ideas and to challenge, Sunday’s proceedings were largely successful; and even the moments that didn’t quite reach such lofty ambitions still made great use of the extraordinary space chosen to host the re-booted event. With the collapse of Bloc after last year’s crisis, festivals which make use of challenging lineups in unconventional spaces are in short supply, making Atonal’s revival all the more welcome.</p>\n",

The previews for XV are now online already, with only a couple of weeks or so since Lakker’s XIV.</p>\n<p>That being said, the rate at which the series comes out certainly doesn’t reflect negatively on its quality - each offering striking mediation between no-frills dancefloor techno, and the mechanical sounding experimentations the label has become perhaps best known for. The fifteenth edition comes from Italian duo Plaster, contributing four deeply textured warehouse cuts.</p>\n<p>'Quasar' kicks off proceedings at full intensity - grinding bass-work undulating beneath rugged percussion and drawn out choral samples buried at the back of the mix. The stripped-down kick-heavy groove throughout brings to mind the music of Tobias - albeit a more twisted and darker sound. This is the sort of track that feels sonically 'full' enough to fill almost any space, without losing anything in intricacy.</p>\n<p>The same can be said of following track, ‘Uret’. Adopting an equally frantic pace, distorted kicks pound between tribal percussion and pulses of static, without a cigarette paper’s width of space between them. The texture of the track is also somewhat unique - maintaining an undeniably clean sound but at the same time playing around with grainy and hoarse timbres.</p>\n<p>The closing two tracks, ‘Tangle’, and ‘Libra’ share similarities with the work of Dadub (incidentally another Italian duo and Stroboscopic mainstay), both tracks exploring the dubbier end of the techno spectrum whilst maintaining a firm grim on the rich, industrial-indebted sonic palette of the former two tracks. In particular, ‘Tangle’ has a refreshingly down-tempo groove to it, and it’s interesting to hear how Plaster can move around the rhythm, manipulating the meter and making it their own. ‘Libra’ is arguably the most interesting track of them all, introducing some more organic sounds to the mix, akin to Shackleton or Demdike Stare, but keeping it grounded within their own style. All in all, this EP has tonnes to offer, and with such a varied mix of styles, puts it near the top of my personal favorites from the Monad series.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F104063501\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

The latest release in the series comes from Northern Irish sisters Lisa &amp; Alice Wallace, deepening Decoy’s explorations into slow building, gritty warehouse techno.</p>\n<p>The adrenaline charged ‘Condemner’ kicks off the EP at full force, as pulsating low-end subs and rippling hats push the track forwards under a jarring, dissonant drone that gradually builds to the drop, a good three and half minutes into the track.</p>\n<p>It is worth taking note of how frenzied both ‘Condemner’ and subsequent track ‘Sporadicus’ feel, especially considering the fact that both tracks operate around the conventional 125bpm mark - neither seem a far cry in terms of energy from something like Regis’ Blood Into Gold release.</p>\n<p>The EP’s hectic pace is somewhat lessened through closing track ‘Everest’, although this isn’t to say the track loses anything in terms of power, as the track sees a jaunty, roughneck bassline suddenly licked into shape by choppy percussion and slow-filtered rising atmosphere drones.</p>\n<p>From the tracks propellant opening, one might hazard a guess the track would develop into the sort of crunchy house appropriated by the likes of Delroy Edwards, or Kyle Hall - however, Everest is long form techno, and as the track progresses the L.A.W sister’s hissing, Rrose style atmospheres begin to assert their dominance.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F103278346\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

The lead track, ‘Bells’ has billowing, vapourous atmospheres that slowly develop over its seven minute duration. It isn’t until past the midpoint that his disquieting arpeggio is deemed fit for introduction, and it proves to be the most notable riff on the track, floating above chugging bass and airy slow decaying percussive samples.</p>\n<p>The same can be said of the following track, ‘In Chains’, despite the fact that it takes a notably more direct approach, working patiently into a steady paced march. A lurching, grizzled bassline takes central focus beneath similarly gaseous percussive samples to the title track.</p>\n<p>The EP’s closer, ‘Subspace Two’, offers reprieve from the brooding small-hour sounds of ‘Bells’ and ‘In Chains’, as heavily phased euphoric chords cloud the mix. Underpinned by relaxed house rhythms, ‘Subspace Two’ wouldn’t sound out of place on a summer’s evening at a club like Watergate.</p>\n<p>Providing a pretty good summation of exactly what it is we like about unsettling early hours techno, the Bells EP shows why the name Terence Fixmer still commands a great deal of respect over a decade since his first release.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F9198709\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>I first became aware of Argentinean producer Juan Pablo Pfirter back in 2009 with his bizarre and haunting track ‘Mi Chica’, which featured as something of a centerpiece for Len Faki’s Berghain mix from the same year. Since then, Pfirter’s sound has matured considerably, and the name of his latest EP, ‘New State of Consciousness’ shouldn’t be taken lightly, as his sound is more focused and sophisticated than ever before.</p>\n<p>The opening track of the same name spends no time messing around. The central motif presents itself immediately, growing and swelling amidst the swathes of noise that surround it. What is perhaps most intriguing about this track lies in its rhythm; beyond the hard, straight drum-machine patterns that ground it, there are strange and infectious rolls that keep just behind the beat, never seeming to ‘fit’ perfectly into the right place. This interplay of grooves creates an enormous amount of intrigue throughout the track, and keeps the listener coming back for more.</p>\n<p>However, for me, it’s ‘Iteration’ that really steals the show on this EP. To put it crudely, Pfirter takes a minimal bundle of sinister notes, and lays them out neatly over some characteristically cacophonous techno sounds, reminiscent of Robert Hood’s early work or indeed some of the more recent Markus Suckut releases. It’s deceptively simple, and could have potentially only taken a few minutes to make. Nevertheless, make no mistake; to do so much with so little takes years of practice, and you can hear Pfirter’s commitment to production coming through on all of these tracks.</p>\n<p>Closing the EP, ‘All You Need Is Volt’ is a wonky ride through analogue acid. The mangled shuffle beats dance around the mix, laying a shaky foundation for yet another eerie hook to draw the listener in and be hypnotized by its snake charmer-like seduction. Overall I think this EP has masses to offer, and I’m no doubt that its alluring peculiarities will keep me revisiting it again and again throughout the year.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Mr7AWgXuLPo\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

With the self-titled album having been in the public domain for several months now, the enigmatic duo have seen fit to offer up the second collection of remixes from the album - this time from Kieth Fullerton Whitman, JK Flesh &amp; Raster-Noton’s Grischa Lichtenberger.</p>\n<p>Kieth Fullerton Whitman exposes murky depths within ‘Anaesthesia’, as sporadic analogue bleeps erratically jumping out of aqueous drones and filtered noise. Of the three, Whitman’s remix is certainly the most abstract - although this is perhaps to be expected given his previous forays into ambient and experimental music for imprints such as Kranky and Pan.</p>\n<p>Gently migrating into more danceable territories, JK Flesh’s interpretation of ‘cX310’ opens with gristled drones and understated tribal drums. Almost four minutes in Flesh’s remix takes an unexpected turn however - working in jungle inspired drum breaks turning what felt like a downcast, Demdike Stare style excursion into something that wouldn’t sound out of place tucked away in Unkle’s back catalogue.</p>\n<p>You can be sure you have a collection of interesting remixes when arguably the most straight forward comes from an artist affiliated with Raster-Noton. Lichtenberger’s glitchy, biting version of ‘Spectral Nightdrive’, makes use of typically Raster-Noton style dehumanised electronics - as sharp blasts of bass pound between unnerving musique concréte style ambience.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F107898831\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

No doubt, the intention and future direction of a newly founded label can be hard to gauge on the basis of its opening release. However, both this EP and the first in the series have a vivid sound to them, comprising of gritty textures and mesmerizing richness. It’s clear that Dicicco has had clearly thought-out plans for the label right from the offset.</p>\n<p>The EP’s opener, ‘Physical’, is a cacophonous jumble of euphoric rushes and dark atmospherics - not dissimilar from the work of someone like Luke Slater or James Ruskin. As hammering bell tolls sit uneasily above the power-driven beat, thundering low-end rumbles beneath surges of industrial noise. No messing about with this one.</p>\n<p>Whilst remaining equally dense, the aptly titled ‘Grainy Days’ is significantly less hectic, stretching granular chimes over lethargically paced drums with foggy, rumbling bass drones. There is masses of space on this track, and it successfully showcases Dicicco as a producer capable of creating highly atmospheric scenes, alongside his signature dancefloor sound.</p>\n<p>Similarly, ‘Excavation’ has a dubby, measured feel to it that provides the perfect platform for Dicicco to build layers of twisted screeches and raw percussion. This has a particularly organic feel about it, as if being played live, and keeps the whole thing moving forward steadily.</p>\n<p>The final track of this EP, ‘Merk’, takes its name from what is presumably a variant on ‘Under the Aquadrome Pt.1’s ‘Werk’. However, ‘Merk’ provides the listener with a far more reflective and downbeat offering to its counterpart, as a grumbling, minimal bassline quivers uncertainly beneath the mix.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F100631852\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

However under the guidance of Pelling’s menacing sci-fi chords, the track is pushed in a more brooding, introspective direction, despite the fact that ticking hats and off-kilter percussion retain the propulsive appeal of its opening section.</p>\n<p>Reportedly a tribute to Modeo’s love of Japanese culture, ‘Three Hundred Seconds Over Tokyo’ brings to mind early-hours rushes of euphoria, contrasting blissful, soporific melodic work with a frantic breakbeat rhythms, bathed in distortion.</p>\n<p>Mael’s ‘Bite’ is a strong contender for the most direct approach taken on the EP, mixing a weighty four to the floor stomp with a 90s indebted, twisted acid synth-line. Whilst the formula may be simple, the way in which Mael structures the track is really quite impressive, crafting tasteful buildups and breakdowns from its various elements over a near nine minute duration.</p>\n<p>Overall, Echoes From The Abyss 003 presents an impressive collage showing how creative and diverse techno can be, whilst remaining within a coherent and cohesive framework.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F101312164\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Yu Miyashita, who also goes by the name Yaporigami, is a musician shamefully overlooked. In July, I found myself blown away by his brilliant new track ‘#001’, with its mysterious backdrop and seductive groove. His blend of glitchy, jarring industrial noises will make your head spin, but behind the sheer power of his sound, there is hidden depth and subtlety, available only to those who listen closely.</p>\n<p>Earlier this week, we caught up with Miyashita to talk music, film and how cities shape us. We were also very lucky to receive a guest mix from the man, which meanders from post-rock ambience to Wagnerian crescendos and loops of paranoid mutterings…</p>\n<p><strong>SL: So to start off, how has 2013 been for you? What have you been up to in the last few months?</strong></p>\n<p>Y: Not many releases compared to 2011/2012 however I have got a few bits of brilliant news. To mention one, a music video “Yu Miyashita - Mimic” directed by Lucio Arese has been screened at Cannes Lions Festival this year. I have been quite productive and making new tracks day by day.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: Last time we spoke you mentioned a sound design project that you’ve been involved with; can you tell us a little more about that?</strong></p>\n<p>Y: To be precise, it is actually more of a soundtrack rather than a sound design project. I seemed to start getting commission offers this year and have created soundtracks to include an art project focusing on abandoned bicycles in Japan called <em>C__ogoo</em>. Furthermore I have done soundtracks for forthcoming British movie called ‘Brash Young Turks’.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: Is this connected to the work you do for video - for example, your music for Lucio Arese’s ‘Mimic’?</strong></p>\n<p>Y: No. Lucio Arese created this video in his own right using all his own cutting edge ideas and skills with no input from me or Mille Plateaux (the label on which Mimic is released - Album - Noble Niche).</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/40162986?color=ffffff\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/40162986\">Lucio Arese | Yu Miyashita - Mimic</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/lucioarese\">Lucio Arese</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: How does the process work for films like that? Is the music completely informed by the visuals or is the whole thing a collaborative effort?</strong></p>\n<p>Y: As for the commission work, yes, the music is led by visuals / concept / director’s ideas. As for all the music videos feature my music so far, filmmakers visualised / created respective world based on my finished tracks.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: Have you got any plans to do more of this kind of stuff in the future?</strong></p>\n<p>Y: If there was a good opportunity coming to me, I would take it.</p>\n<p><strong>SL: You seem to be something of a musical dualist - I understand that although you currently reside near Tokyo, you have also been active in Brighton, furthermore; you play under two different monikers; Yaporigami and Yu Miyashita. What do you think differs between these two cities culturally, and what was your thinking behind the use of two separate names?</strong></p>\n<p>Y: I’m currently at a prefecture called Yamanashi where my hometown is. This area is totally surrounded by mountains with some lakes. Brighton is facing to the sea and has many different nationalities. According to this fact, it seems that I have spent a time in two quite different places. Cultural differences between these two are too many to mention I feel. They are almost opposite. I feel that living in culturally different places is a real good thing to get outside of the box.</p>\n<p>What I mean by the box is a limitation line unconsciously ruled in you defined by your background. I always find “finding this line” interesting and try to overlook it (in the sense of taking a bird’s eye view.) Once you realise it’s there, your new line is now outside of the previous line. Thus you endlessly try to redefine the start of your limitation lines.</p>\n<p>I started making electronic music as Yaporigami creating electronica / breakcore. It was all beat-orientated until I started making glitch / noise music. I was initially thinking of using the name Yaporigami for that but came up with an idea of using my real name for it not to confuse listeners and thus I use two names now.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/36343749?color=ffffff\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/36343749\">[BRDG007] SyncBody</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/brdg\">BRDG</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n<p>**SL: So do you think living in two separate places over your life has shaped your sound? Who were you listening to at the time and who are some of your favorites now? **</p>\n<p>Y: Yes, definitely. At the very beginning of my career I was heavily influenced by CDR (Japanese breakcore artist on 19-t) and Aphex Twin. I remember music from labels such as ROMZ (JP), Planet-mu (UK), WARP (UK) were often on my speakers. My current favourite labels are 10 LABEL (JP), Blackest Ever Black (UK) and Stroboscopic Artefacts (DE).</p>\n<p><strong>SL: Last year you released a split album with Junichi Akagawa. What was that like? Is Akagawa someone you have plans to do more collaborative work with?</strong></p>\n<p>Y: I was invited to play in Berlin for Mille Plateaux night and that’s where I met Akagawa. I checked his works after the event and found them interesting. I contacted him soon after and we decided to make a collaborative work during my stay in Berlin. It was all spontaneous. We don’t have a concrete plan to collaborate again yet. Since he does visuals as well it might be interesting to do a music video next time maybe? ;)</p>\n<p><strong>SL: You’ve played a great deal of live shows this year. What exactly is involved when you play live? Any plans to come to the UK soon?</strong></p>\n<p>Y: I have three upcoming live shows:</p>\n<p>First one is for closing party of Transitio MX festival in Mexico on 29th September. It will be audio visual live show with great Japanese artist Vokoi.</p>\n<p>Second one is for Hz-records 3rd anniversary event in Tokyo.</p>\n<p>Third one is for 2nd day of Electronic Music of Art Festival Tokyo on 4th November.

The first of these burgeoning artists to cement Deeply Rooted’s newly vamped manifesto, is Ear To Ground co-founder Dax J, contributing a four track EP traversing a plethora of his own key influences.</p>\n<p>Whilst the word ‘house’ may have outstayed it’s welcome in the label’s title, deep still remains an extremely relevant adjective, especially given the smokey, dub-tinged stabs of Dax J’s opening gambit, ‘D1’. Rhythmically, ‘D1’ calls to mind Jonas Kopp’s often skeletal approach to drums, as punchy, mid-range kicks are offset by tinny hats, and coarse claps and snares.</p>\n<p>Delving several shades darker, second track ‘Something In The Woods’, centres around a crooked, 90s style acid riff, snaking between pummelling rhythms and unsettling synthetic textures. Whilst the track may take a fairly conventional approach, it still remains a clever exercise in seeing what can be done with a specific array of classic techno tools.</p>\n<p>Thudding kicks and hazy, disorientating chords make up the basis of third track ‘Stolen Glory’, a peak-time offering to big scale warehouse techno.</p>\n<p>Given that the previous tracks adopt fairly classic approaches to the techno format, ‘Angel Dust’ is something of a curveball. Whilst the opening half remains a relatively straight-edged floor filler, the second portion is interlaced with choppy jungle breaks (along with Lyn Collins’ omnipresent ‘Woo, Yeah’ sample), perhaps a consequence of Dax J’s formative years spent mixing jungle and D&amp;B as a DJ on London’s pirate radio stations.</p>\n<p>It’s somewhat gratifying to see a label head as established as DJ Deep delving into new territory after ten successful years of Deeply Rooted, and off the back of Dax J’s immaculately produced EP we’re more than looking forward to seeing where his sonic voyages take the label next.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F107842010\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Berlin resident Lui Urbano seems to be taking the Techno scene by storm as of late, gaining support from a multitude of legendary figures, such as Dave Clarke, Function and Chris Leibling with just a few release under his belt.</p>\n<p>This said, the calibre of those releases potentially explains how Urbano has managed such critical acclaim in a short space of time, releasing with labels such as Affin and Dynamic Reflection, and perhaps most pivotally unleashing his pummelling ‘2XR909’ EP through Decoy Records.</p>\n<p>The progression from sending tracks to Decoy founder Rebekah to releasing on the label seems like a very natural one, having first met the Birmingham bred DJ at a Weekendstories event. “Rebekah and I got along very well.” he says of their first encounter. “I was already aware in advance that she has shown me support so I made her a demo CD and gave her my contact details. Shortly thereafter I had a message from her that she would like to release 4 tracks from the demo on her label Decoy. I was very happy about that. Decoy is still a young but good label with a lot of great artists.”</p>\n<p>Traversing a range of different old school influences, Urbano cites the likes of Jeff Mills and Joey Beltram as inspiring the EP. “Decoy is definitely the right home for this sound” he states, and with a slew of further releases in the pipeline the 2XR909 EP probably won’t be the last example of Urbano’s idiosyncratic take on 90s style warehouse Techno. ”Soon I will release a 12 vinyl on the label Nasyt Teme Records with a remix by Flug, another EP on Ketra with remixes by Deepbass and Mark Morris and an EP with Oliver Kucera on YMN. Towards end of the year I will release a White Label vinyl. On top of that there will be a bunch of releases for artists like DJ Surgules, Second Area, Submerge on labels such as Harthouse, Illegal Alien Records and many more. And of course there will be another release on Decoy, more info to come soon.”</p>\n<p>Whilst we can’t share a tracklist for the mix, Urbano’s offering traverses a range of hard-hitting dancefloor sounds, whilst managing to remain within a coherent framework. “It’s very important to me to play a variety of music but you can never lose your own style.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/stray-landings-mix-series/id556425050?mt=2\">Subscribe in iTunes</a></p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"130\" src=\"//www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?feed=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0022-urbano%2F&show_tracklist=&stylecolor=&hide_artwork=&mini=&embed_type=widget_standard&embed_uuid=9590d60b-8318-4393-bb2b-fea099f26698&hide_cover=\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/0022-urbano/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=resource_link\">0022 // Urbano</a> by <a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=profile_link\">Stray Landings</a> on <a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=homepage_link\"> Mixcloud</a></p>\n",

Chiming polyrhythms float over pounding bass and gently shuffling percussion. The way in which Slater leads out of the track is particularly clever, as his bell like melody seems to stumble over itself, before gently filtering out through the closing minutes.</p>\n<p>Given the similar use of chiming melodic elements in second track ‘Undertow’, ‘No Exit’ makes for a fitting opener setting the tone for the rest of the record. Whilst through ‘No Exit’ these melodies were given central focus however, through ‘Undertow’ they provide a subdued backdrop to Slater’s trance-inducing rhythms and ghostly atmospherics.</p>\n<p>Continuing to grow progressively darker, closer ‘Nanendi’ is a phantom-like track, despite its rather dry, conventional opening. Roughly a minute and a half in, Slater sets the track down a different course - muffled air raid sirens and piercing filtered beeps shimmer over a cloudy low-end, feeling like the disturbing, barren aftermath of some kind of nuclear fallout.</p>\n<p>Expectedly, the release highlights that Slater’s originality has only increased over his long-standing career (not to mention his now masterful production skills), providing an EP of characteristically sweltering early-hours Techno, as infectious as it is unsettling.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F109532905\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

The <em>Wasteland</em> LP comprises their second full-length offering, and also marks a migration from the more conventional, post-rock outlook of their debut, <em>Intangible States.</em></p>\n<p>Whilst the album has a heavily electronic sound, it is their use of live recordings, taken during sessions at a desecrated Antwerp-based church that push the album to another level, proving Ecker and Meulyzer’s patience and commitment to their art. Similarly with Lumisokea’s <em>Selva</em>, a passion for orchestral music combined with an imaginative vision for re-contextualising it, results in something rather special, revealing the often unexploited flexibility of classical music.</p>\n<p>It comes as little surprise the pair have enlisted Yannick Jacquet to develop an audiovisual show of the album, given its filmic nature. During brooding opener ‘Hollow Men’ or following track ‘Charon’ it is almost possible to visualise scenes from Andrei Tarkovsky’s 1979 film <em>Stalker</em>. Both centre around the use of menacing Cello tones and tribal percussion, marking out the LP’s intended direction from the outset.</p>\n<p>As the record progresses, the use of organic percussion begins to hold more and more sway. ‘Rite’ is particularly notable for its use of seasick drums, rolling toms gently increasing and decreasing in pace, over crunchy, stabbing chords. The way these chime in on the offbeat adds a slightly dub feel to the track, an approach further explored in the closing portion of following track ‘Solemn’.</p>\n<p>Echoing drums open the track, working up to razor-sharp strings and contemplative guitar, and prepared piano musings. Around the midpoint however, the track’s rather frantic drums give way to echoing, downcast stabs, interlaced with reverb laden percussion.</p>\n<p>The deconstructed feel to ‘Ruins’ makes a clever follow on from this - as if the minimal ending to ‘Solemn’ requires reconstruction from the ground up. Slowly pattering toms lead into the album’s finale, ‘Vultures’. The track seems to capture a sense of looming threat, its lumbering, claustrophobic percussion reminiscent of Violetshaped’s self-titled LP.</p>\n<p>If Dadub were to release on Raster-Noton, _Wasteland _might be something comparable to how it would sound; emotive and texturally rich, yet also with a strong emphasis on synthesis and icy electronics. The progression from <em>Intangible States</em> to <em>Wasteland</em> is pretty impressive to say the least, even given the two year gap between the releases. Ecker &amp; Meulyzer are clearly a pair able to dissect their own work, slowly honing their vision without the need to rely on current trends.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"400\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F8622425\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Conlon’s ‘Danica’ EP spans five tracks of thundering, 90s-indebted Birmingham Techno, including a reflective reworking of the title track from Inigo Kennedy.</p>\n<p>The influence of producer’s such as Regis &amp; Surgeon are especially palpable throughout opening track ‘Danica’, crossed with a crunching Tresor-like darkness. Its thick, vapourous textures and tightly locked groove make it hard to divert your attention even momentarily, as echoing percussion and breathy atmospheres intertwine above the obligatory thudding bass.</p>\n<p>Inigo Kennedy’s rework follows this, hitting hard right from the offset. Slowly building in more and more layers of percussion, the mid-point sees the introduction of blissful, reverent chords, providing a different slant on ‘Danica’ to the rather bleak soundscapes presented in the original.</p>\n<p>As one of the lighter of Conlon’s original productions on the EP, ‘My Favourite Colour Is Bricks’ is well placed to follow the Inigo Kennedy’s mix of ‘Danica’. A propulsive, yet rather straight forward House rhythm kicks on the track, before techy stabs work their way in providing a rather hypnotic tension builder leading into the deranged madness of closing tracks ‘Jabbermouth’ &amp; ‘Groke 13’.</p>\n<p>Both highlight the Birmingham based producers talents when it comes to working with acid-tinged analogue synth-play, closing the EP with bags of energy. Whilst ‘Jabbermouth’ keeps the listener on edge with pointed drums and off-kilter shuffles, the rhythms within ‘Groke 13’ roll with surprising ease, latching onto the track’s twisting acid-riff and never letting go.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"400\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F9324083\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

What we can tell you however is that Sylphe is a vinyl-only imprint with a simple, unrestricted aim - to release “unconventional and honest electronic music, with no compromises”.</p>\n<p>Who is behind the two intriguing moniker’s Holdie Gawn &amp; Micawber that have appeared on every Sylphe release so far is anyone’s guess, however both their productions feature a wealth of musical ideas which interlink beautifully with one another.</p>\n<p>Listening through to Holdie Gawn’s previous contributions to the Sylphe series it’s clear that the producer holds a penchant for sullen, downcast techno which makes up the groundwork from which he can recontextualise a range of different samples. Gawn’s contribution to 04, ‘Quotre’ is no different, as powdery, shuffled rhythms drive forward downcast musique concréte style piano work. Peripheral growls and filtered outcries occasionally break through, leading up to Gawn’s breakdown, providing a stuttered piano interlude before sinking back into the realms of hypnotic dub-techno.</p>\n<p>Whilst remaining equally as mesmeric as the a-side offering, ‘Wierden’ takes on the kind of sparse percussion and murky low-end you’d expect to find in Rrose’s productions, as outbursts of unsettling, analogue synth work occasionally punctuate Micawber’s dense atmospheres.</p>\n<p>It’s testament to the quality of Sylphe’s output thus far that the label has managed to gain such respectability with little information put out about itself or its artists, and an incredibly refreshing approach in an age that seems to be increasingly dominated by glossy images and endless press releases.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F105559498\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>When you hear the name Hans Bouffmyhre for the first time, you might hazard a guess the prolific producer and Sleaze label head was raised in a city like Berlin, growing up in an environment exuding the very spirit of Techno twenty-four hours a day. In actual fact Hans Bouffmyhre is a pseudonym devised by Glaswegian Stephen Gorrie, for the very reason that it conjures up images of some kind of enigmatic Techno demigod.</p>\n<p>Beginning by hosting parties under the Sleaze name, Gorrie’s career has followed a very natural progression, entering the world of music production in 2007, and establishing the label arm of the Sleaze brand in 2008.</p>\n<p>With an impressive series of releases under his belt, Gorrie has recently turned in a pulverising four track EP of peak-time warehouse Techno to Electric Deluxe, that’s both weighty and hypnotic in equal measure.</p>\n<p>With the ‘Catapult’ EP on the brink of release, we caught up with Gorrie to discuss being brought up in Glasgow, Sleaze’s origins, as well as what’s next for the diligent Scotsman.</p>\n<p><strong>So first off, how did you first hook up with Electric Deluxe? Have you worked with Jochem for Sleaze events prior to releasing with the label?</strong></p>\n<p>I first met Jochem at one of his Electric Deluxe showcases during ADE at Melkweg a couple of years back. I was there to see my mate Gary Beck playing and Gary then introduced me to Jochem. A few weeks after that, I was booked to play alongside Jochem at Tony Rohr’s birthday party in Frankfurt. It was that night he told me he wanted to sign my track ‘Hypnosis’ to Electric Deluxe, which I was very excited about.</p>\n<p><strong>You released an EP with Electric Deluxe mid-last year, how do you feel the new release differs from ‘Hypnosis’?</strong></p>\n<p>For me ‘Hypnosis’ was the stand out track on the last EP. That’s why I included a couple of tools along with it, so DJ’s could get creative with the catchy synth line. The Catapult EP is made up of 4 strong tracks, which I have already played out a lot. Personally it’s hard for me to pick a favourite. I hope people will enjoy it!</p>\n<p><strong>Considering you’ve only been producing since 2007, the number of releases you’ve had is pretty staggering. With this, and running the label and event side of Sleaze, how do you find the time for everything?</strong></p>\n<p>Well i’ve always tried to be productive in the studio. At the moment i’m trying to make 4 new tracks every month if possible. Whether it be as Hans Bouffmyhre, or under my new alias Secluded. That doesn’t mean that all of them will be released though. I have a lot of unreleased material lying around on my hard drive. In terms of running my label, I have always had the ‘hands on’ approach. With the help of my Brother we do everything ourselves. Sometimes the work can get a bit much, especially if i’m gigging a lot over the weekend, but we always find the time to catch up and get things done.</p>\n<p><strong>The latest Sleaze EP comes from UZB backed by two amazing remixes from Mark Broom &amp; Markus Suckut. What do you look for in a speculative release for Sleaze, and how do you go about choosing remix artists?</strong></p>\n<p>Well first of all it takes some special original tracks, which get me excited. Then we can decide on whether or not to include remixes. It’s important to try and get a remix artist who’s style suits the vibe of the original track. I think on SLEAZE084, this worked out perfectly with Mark Broom &amp; Markus Suckut, who have both done a great job.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5449/9937116115_fa5b6618b7_m.jpg\" alt=\"hans\"></p>\n<p><strong>How do you think the label’s origins as an event series have informed its releases?</strong></p>\n<p>Running the monthly ‘Sleaze’ party was a great way for us to start out. It was ideal for making contacts and building our profile before starting the label. We are still good friends with guys like Par Grindvik, Perc, Phil Kieran &amp; Gary Beck, who we booked back in 2006/2007.</p>\n<p><strong>What were the first parties you hosted like? Any memorable stories?</strong></p>\n<p>They were mental! We were all young and having a great time, while bringing some big international techno talent to our home town. One of the memorable ‘sell-out’ events was having Extrawelt playing live for our 1st Birthday party. That night was immense! I must say though, some of the after-parties at my Brother’s flat were just as memorable as the events themselves ;)</p>\n<p><strong>Having put on events all around the world, which venues would you say you’ve enjoyed playing at the most?</strong></p>\n<p>In recent years I would have to say that both Berghain &amp; Tresor have been special places to play. It’s amazing to have two techno clubs as good as this in the same city. You can’t ask for more!</p>\n<p><strong>To what extent do you think being raised in Glasgow influenced your tastes? Was it mainly Techno you listened to growing up?</strong></p>\n<p>We were lucky to have a strong techno scene in Glasgow growing up. I started going to Slam’s techno events at the Arches when I was 17 and was instantly inspired. There’s always something good on each weekend.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally, Sleaze had it’s five year anniversary celebrations at the start of the month. What do you have in store for the future?</strong></p>\n<p>We have our ADE showcase on Thursday 17th October at Transformatorhuis in Amsterdam. The last couple of years have been special and this year looks like it could be the best yet. I also have my first Hans Bouffmyhre album on Sleaze Records coming up. It’s called ‘Where I Belong’ and will be out in December.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F104080888\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Vladislav Delay, Lluomo, Sistol &amp; Conoco are just a few of the monikers he has adopted to represent the differing musical approaches he has taken over the years. His latest project however sees the use of his actual surname, Ripatti, as the title to front a new vinyl-only label project, created as an outlet to service his own productions and collaborations.</p>\n<p>Whilst a few short clips of the debut offering ‘01’ have been uploaded to the fledgling label’s soundcloud, this is really a record that needs listening from start to finish to fully appreciate. The tracks span upwards of ten minutes each - the subtle shifts and developments that take place throughout them being central to their appeal.</p>\n<p>A-side offering ‘#39’ has most in common with perhaps Ripatti’s most regularly-used project, Vladislav Delay. Unlike most of the Vladislav Delay output however, ‘#39’ is surprisingly DJ friendly. The tracks drafty melodic elements come with their own distinct rhythm, adding an extra layer of groove to Ripatti’s skippy, shuffling drums and metallic hi-end percussion.</p>\n<p>On the flip, ‘#24’ takes a refreshingly different approach. Its closest qualifier is probably Drum &amp; Bass, although attempting to bracket such an idiosyncratic, leftfield track as such clearly wouldn’t do it justice. Mangled, fax machine style beeps and bleeps spill out over frantically paced breakbeat rhythms, interspersed with what sounds like heavily processed vocal samples. There is a sense of tension throughout the entire track, and as it progresses the various elements showcased individually in different sections are slowly interlaced with each other.</p>\n<p>As the first impression made to the label, 01 is a strong debut, not least for the fact that it shows yet <em>another</em> side to Sasu Ripatti, rather than simply acting as an outlet for his other existing projects. This gives the sense that the imprint is capable of becoming an acclaimed entity in its own right, distinct from the genre-challenging artist’s already incredibly diverse existing catalogue.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F9852283\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Having celebrated their fifth anniversary at the beginning of last month, the party-come-label continues onwards and upwards, with an EP from Barcelona based Unam Zetineb, otherwise known as simply UZB. If news of a fresh Sleaze release wasn’t enough on its own, the 12” also features remixes from possibly my two favourite Marks in Techno; Mark Broom and Markus Suckut.</p>\n<p>Zetineb’s originals adopt a fairly classic style of big room Techno, opening track ‘Crome’ bringing to mind some of the more hypnotic early productions of Dave Clarke. Thick, echoing chords run almost the entire length of the track, complementing muscular warehouse style rhythms.</p>\n<p>Venturing down a more unsettling route, ‘Margen Position’ feels equally suited to fill large spaces, despite feeling tailored more towards early-hour plays. The track wouldn’t sound out of place alongside some of the Mote-Evolver output, drudgy low-end contrasting with the fairly clean, modulated analogue melody which leads the track.</p>\n<p>Techno veteran Mark Broom turns in a slow burning version of ‘Crome’, capitalising on the dub-tinged chords of the original by stripping them back to create infectious swung rhythms from the remaining jagged stabs. Broom’s pruning of the track also extends to it’s rhythmic elements, turning the original’s booming, reverberated kicks into targeted blasts of low-end. Through his overall streamlining of ‘Crome’, Broom has managed to create some angular, and laden with groove, without loosing any of the deep, hypnotic appeal of the original.</p>\n<p>Suckut employs a similar level of precision through his re-imagining of ‘Margen Position’, also shedding the original of any excessive reverb and generally boiling the track down to it’s essentials. The originals disconcerting melodic line sounds as though it has been sent through a rather severe noise-gate, as fractured snippets of the riff jut out between shuffled percussion.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F113207330\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Whilst perhaps not <em>quite</em> as frantically prolific, the 2012 founded vinyl outlet for the project, Affin LTD, has itself racked up twelve releases in just over a year, continuing to cement the imprint’s values as proprietors of quality House and Techno.</p>\n<p>The most recent in the series comes from a producer who has had notable previous relations with the label - Reggy Van Oers. Brooding, mechanical soundscapes dominate the release, yet despite the dark, foreboding textures, ‘TRC’ is packed with groove and rhythmic appeal.</p>\n<p>'TRC01' opens proceedings with a familiarly rugged stomp, quickly introducing swelling drones, contrasted with frosty, hissing percussion. Oers use of hi-end percussion through the track is especially captivating, interrupting a rather conventional groove around the mid point with off-kilter triplet shakes.</p>\n<p>Clearing away some of the fog of the EP’s opening gambit, ’TRC02’ takes a more direct approach- throbbing chords and punchy kicks instead taking central focus. It’s easy to become lost in the track’s mesmeric sway, subtle structural developments across it’s seven minutes being enough to retain the listeners interest without breaking its spell.</p>\n<p>Developer continues in this vein through his remix, whilst simultaneously sharpening the angles of Oers’ dubby, hypnotic chords - injecting a more acute pulse to the track’s natural rhythm.</p>\n<p>Following his subtle, analogue inflected ‘Used’ EP for Affin in mid-2012, its nice to see Chris Page return to the label on remix duties, the London based producer having cemented himself more firmly in the Techno community with the thundering ‘Corpus Delicti’ EP released via Decoy Records earlier this year. Page’s interpretation of ‘TRC01’ is not to be taken lightly, converting the atmospheric original into a propulsively fierce militant stomper.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F113346655\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Having stood inactive since Truss’ ‘Splot’ EP released in November of last year, OCS reappeared on the scene recently with the six track debut EP from Mike Jefford aka Positive Centre, ‘An Assembly’.</p>\n<p>Whether or not the release can act as a general indicator of Jefford’s musical inclinations is hard to guage at this stage, but for now ‘An Assembly’ places him in the realms of murky gothic Techno championed by the likes of Samuel Kerridge, Raime or Demdike Stare.</p>\n<p>At times,the release feels as if it could be attempting to mimic the sounds of functional industrial spaces - the murky, thudding low-end and grating, mechanical percussion of ‘Thought and Intention’ or ‘Stations of Section’ wouldn’t feel out of place soundtracking the eerie remains of a WWII munitions factory.</p>\n<p>Despite these more overtly industrial offerings the release isn’t totally void of melodic elements, however even the gentle arpeggios of a track like ‘An Assembly’ are partly obscured by throbbing atmospherics and the omnipresent wall of vapourous low-end. Far from being to the releases detriment however, these sonic trademarks act as the common thread through Jefford’s shifting approaches throughout the release.</p>\n<p>Operating for the most part at a languid sub-120bpm, the release’s slow tempo might potentially suggest a lack of movement, however propulsive low-end and driving percussion make tracks like ’Otherwise Black’ or ‘Where Flows The How Flows’ well suited to dancefloor settings, without loosing anything in terms of texture and mood.</p>\n<p>All considered, ‘An Assembly’ is a remarkably strong debut, making the Positive Centre project a welcome addition to one of the more creative sub-sects of Techno, of which I am very much enjoying charting the development.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F105452131\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Having had a career spanning roughly fourteen years, you’d expect things may be slowing down for DJ, label-head and producer Joachim Spieth. To the contrary however, March of last year saw Spieth step things up a peg, setting up the vinyl frontier to his widely celebrated Affin label, with Affin LTD. Following its inauguration Affin LTD sees its thirteenth addition this week, with a dub-infused three tracker from Spieth himself scheduled to follow in November.</p>\n<p>With this, and the sixth anniversary of the Affin imprint steadily approaching, we caught up with Spieth to discuss the history of the imprint, what it was like to have his debut release with Kompakt, and how he balances running a label with finding time to produce his own material.</p>\n<p><strong>Hi Joachim, so how are things? I believe I am right in saying the release of your ‘Dark Matter’ EP for Affin is not too far away, can you tell us a little bit about this?</strong></p>\n<p>Hi Theo, thanks I’m fine! “Dark Matter”, produced this summer is following my preference for Dub-Techno, like “Sensual” and some other tunes I made in the last two years.</p>\n<p>As i already talked to Gez (Varley/G-Man) some time before I knew that in general he was up for a remix and this title seemed just to be the one to make it happen. In the same time D. Diggler and I met online and so after mailing some days I thought that he would complete this project in the perfect way. The 12” will appear in November and I’m curious about reactions &amp; feedbacks from others. I’m really happy to have them both as we all share a love for Dub Techno.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you first get into production? You had your debut release with Kompakt which is a pretty impressive first move.</strong></p>\n<p>I was into music long time before I discovered electronic music. When I finally had a setup things worked out quickly. I released several 12”s on Kompakt from 1999 - 2004. My debut included some of my earliest tunes that I made. As I was a customer of their mail-order this developed just naturally, but sure, I was really happy that they gave me an option to present my ideas to a wider audience.</p>\n<p>**Your early productions seem to take quite a lot of influence from Minimal, whilst your more recent work feel more influenced by Dub, and Industrial Techno. Which records do you think have had the most influence on your productions over the years? **</p>\n<p>Ah, there were a lot of records that influenced me. It’s impossible to center it just on 4-5 EPs but labels that really influenced my music back in the days were Warp Records, all Hardwax based labels (Basic Channel, Chain Reaction, Main Street…), Kompakt (Profan/ Studio 1…) and also music from Detroit (Juan Atkins, Robert Hood…) Most of these imprints are still actual for me, so Techno for me is a longtime relationship besides from short trends.</p>\n<p><strong>What sort of things were you listening to growing up? Has Techno always been your focus musically?</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7360/10294605045_ab08ab0ac0_n.jpg\" alt=\"Spieth\"></p>\n<p>No, when I was younger I was into Heavy Metal, later also Hip Hop and some other styles…</p>\n<p><strong>With such a hectic release schedule on Affin, is it hard to find time to work on your own tracks? How do you keep up with everything?</strong></p>\n<p>A long time I didn’t produce a lot, but since 2011 I’m working more constantly than before. Now I try to fix upcoming releases much earlier than in the beginning of the label, so that some weeks I mainly concentrate on selecting, writing press infos, communicate with the artists etc…  and the time after I have more space to go on with my own projects. Moreover, I stopped listening demos as the roster is really big now.</p>\n<p><strong>What were your original intentions in setting up the label and do you think the direction has changed much over the years?</strong></p>\n<p>The main thing was to grow our own family besides trends and forces that some other labels seem to take care of. I wanted to be free with the music I release and I also got demos from good newcomers. The idea of founding a label was present a long time before I launched it. From the intention of what the label was meant to be it’s not a big difference between 2008 and now. But in the beginning the label was more open to different styles, this changed a bit in the last two years. Nowadays it’s more focussed on Techno.</p>\n<p><strong>Also, what was it that made you decide to setup Affin LTD – the vinyl outlet of the project?</strong></p>\n<p>It was clear that one day we would do vinyl but from the beginning of the label I first wanted to experiment a bit with different people &amp; sounds, so that the style of the label was formed without too much pressure. I think it wasn’t a mistake as we already got good reactions and respect from a lot of people around. Affin never was a cheap digital label without any investment in it.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of Affin LTD, 013 starts shipping this week. How do you go about putting together various artist EPs such as this one?</strong></p>\n<p>With EXPAND (Affin 013 LTD) we have Alex Bau, Cleric &amp; Unam Zetineb together on one 12”. The idea of these v/a 12”s is just to give a maximum of flexibility to the customers buying it. Bringing together different names also ensures to get recognized by different groups of people, so it’s a way of making connections.</p>\n<p><strong>There seems to be an emphasis on pushing new talent with the label, how do you go about sourcing your artists?</strong></p>\n<p>For a while the roster seems to be almost complete and more constant than in the early days. Most acts from the last 1-2 years were recommended by acts that already were in the pool. For me it’s not easy now to select material, because i get far too many demos. Therefore I also denied some good stuff just because it would be to much output.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally, as you mentioned earlier in our email exchange it’s nearing six years since Affin was founded, any special plans to celebrate the anniversary?</strong></p>\n<p>Have a look on it….  :-)</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"320\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/10578072\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Affin LTD 013 remains consistent with this, each offering taking a mangled, spartan approach to the industrial-edged brand of Techno with which the label has been concerning itself with as of late.</p>\n<p>Kicking off proceedings with sweltering intensity, CLR affiliate Alex Bau contributes ‘Diversions’ - a claustrophobic, no frills percussive assault. Crumpled blasts of low-end shunt their way forward, beneath throbs of static and grainy rhythms. The track climaxes around the four minute mark, his distorted percussion building to a chaotic frenzy, almost threatening to derail itself.</p>\n<p>Bau’s use of lo-fi percussion is a trait carried through onto ‘Pressure Cabin’ the addition of Manchester based Cleric. Aside from this similarity however, the track is an otherwise welcome break in pace from the relentless opener. Cleric instead centres his offering around a staccato analogue riff, daintily meandering between a familiarly muscular Techno stomp.</p>\n<p>The final offering comes from Unam Zetineb, otherwise known as simply UZB. His track entitled ‘Presage’ follows on from his ‘Margen Position’ EP for Glasgow based Sleaze Records released last month. Whilst Zetineb’s Sleaze release concerned itself with the dubbier end of the Techno Spectrum, ‘Presage’s focus is more direct - it’s darkened atmospheres and thudding drums pummelling across a near seven minutes duration.</p>\n<p>Through the curation of Affin LTD 013 Spieth has managed to find a common thread between three artists that at first glance may not seem to have much link, the final result capitalising on each’s abilities when it comes to crafting stripped-back warehouse strength Techno.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/elMD1xG4JyU\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Rather than signalling a drop in activity for Downliners Sekt, the break in releases infact heralds quite the opposite - the production of their third full-length offering, to be released next year via InFiné Records.</p>\n<p>The release of ‘Balt Shakt’ comes as something of a taster of the forthcoming album, and is indicative of the territory the LP will inhabit. Straddling a line between the grainy, post-rock tinged two-step offerings they have worked on previously and ambience-imbued Techno, ‘Balt Shakt’ continues to refine the highly distinctive niche the pair have carved out for themselves.</p>\n<p>Tender washes of pleasantly coarse synthesiser introduce a-side offering ‘Part 1’, occasionally interspersed with gently emotive vocal sampling calling to mind James Blake’s 2010 ‘Klavierwerke’ EP. Distant, stumbling percussion adds to the track’s hypnotic charm, an assortment of real-world sounds manipulated and ordered into a shuffled four to the floor pulse. Murky organs and clattering snares slowly build as the track progresses, working up to a reverberating crescendo in the closing minutes of the track.</p>\n<p>The second component to ‘Balt Shakt’ occupies a roughly similar space, bringing tribalistic drums to the fore, thudding beneath crackling ambient textures and rises of throbbing white-noise. As the track eases in its final portion sullen piano tones break through cloudy atmospherics creating a beautifully melancholic finale.</p>\n<p>Given that it’s been a good five years since the last full-length offering from Downliners Sekt, the prospect of another is something to be afforded much anticipation, especially given how far the outfit have come since the comparatively maximalist Breakbeat and Trip Hop offerings of 2008’s <em>The Saltire Wave</em>. Whilst perhaps not giving too much away, 'Balt Shakt' does suggest a freshly calibrated take on the sound Downliners Sekt have acquainted themselves with before, of which I am more than looking forward to immersing myself in.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F112765915\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Few artists manage to dodge classification quite so successfully as Sasu Ripatti. Over his lengthy career the Finnish producer has taken many approaches, from the punchy, jazz-imbued House of Lluomo, to the glitchy dub-infused offerings of his Sistol alias not too mention his work as Vladislav Delay, existing right on the fringe of what might be considered Ambient music.</p>\n<p>Having relocated back to Finland in the last few years to build his new home and studio, Ripatti has also discovered a new musical residence for himself in his recently established vinyl-only imprint entitled simply ‘Ripatti’.</p>\n<p>With the second release on the label inbound in the form of a ‘Heisenberg’ 12” (Ripatti’s collaboration with Max Lodenbauer) we thought it would be fitting to catch with him to discuss the new imprint, his ‘Shark Reef’ studio and weigh up the benefits &amp; drawbacks of formal musical training.</p>\n<p><strong>So first off, what was it that prompted you to start the The Ripatti label? I’ve read that you’ve had problems working with external labels - given this, do you think this imprint will become the home for most of your future output?</strong></p>\n<p>First of all, I think you’ll have problems with and without other labels as long as you’re in the music business… but the main thing is that while there’s no money to be made with records I at least want to have as great products out as possible and have as good a time doing it as possible.</p>\n<p>I hope the new label will become the main output channel for my music for a long time and that I can create a nice catalogue of various work, but I’ve seen things change drastically in cycles and surely more changes will come. I already once started a label after releasing on other labels and it made sense back then, then at some point I saw no reason to run my own label anymore and started releasing elsewhere instead, until recently again I really wanted to start my own channel.</p>\n<p>Besides the industry things etc. it also relates to what one wants and how much capacities one has and all that. Recently I seem to like the idea of taking over control and avoid various compromises and executing my own vision.</p>\n<p><strong>In terms of the musical side of the Ripatti project, you are (at least in part) working with faster tempos that you perhaps have previously. Have you been listening to more footwork/D&amp;B lately, or was this something you just decided to experiment with?</strong></p>\n<p>I haven’t listened to much of that new fast stuff, partly consciously to not be aware of what and how people make stuff, but also there’s lots of stuff I didn’t relate to. It might need a different medium, I can imagine that music working well in clubs with a good DJ. Some of the Chicago guys are doing nice stuff from what I’ve heard, but I must admit I like more the attitude and the concept than how it actually sounds.</p>\n<p>From my side the past few years I have been getting quite bored of ambient and slow stuff, but equally of 4/4 grooves and have been slowly drifting to more fast tempos and going for rhythmic variations.<br>\nI enjoy doing stuff for the first time and experimenting with new things; this is what’s been going on, with faster tempos many things work differently. i also like the hectic feeling and intensity fast tempos generate.</p>\n<p>I’ve also always liked 2-step a lot, not that I’ve been listening to it actively but it’s probably my favourite dance music. I also listened and actually produced some Drum &amp; Bass in the late 90s, so that style is not totally alien to me, it’s just that I never released any of that stuff early on and kept away from it for a long time.</p>\n<p><strong>Is there a reason behind the use your real name for this latest enterprise, opposed to adopting another pseudonym?</strong></p>\n<p>Nothing particular. I didn’t want to release the Ripatti stuff under existing names and didn’t feel like creating another name. I also like the duality of label and project name.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about the studio you have built for yourself? How long had you been planning the new home and how does it feel having lived there for a while?</strong></p>\n<p>Studio… that’s a book if we start talking about it… I see it as an instrument in itself, with whatever is there. But it’s more than just bits and pieces of gear, it’s how they work together and how it all sounds and functions, can you play the studio and how well. Can you stay there for hours and feel afresh, stay inspired, can you trust the monitors and what you’re hearing and doing after a long day, is the sound tiring or not, is there oxygen, is there a view from outside and what kind. All these things matter greatly much more than what gear there is. Pretty much all gear is useless unless you can hear what you’re doing and also no gear helps in the end if you’re not inspired. Sometimes I also feel, listening to music being made today, is that all the gear begins to sound the same in the end, no matter what exclusive fancy gear is being used.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2820/10421529894_bd5499a984_z.jpg\" alt=\"Vladislav Delay Studio\"></p>\n<p>Anyway, while living in Berlin I started seriously thinking about building a studio somewhere, preferably from scratch so to be able to design as good acoustic environment as possible, to avoid compromises you always have to deal with when moving to an existing space and trying to make that sound good. We were looking for a place to move, to live and work, which took several years and when we found the island and a property we started the project. First it took quite some time to get acoustic planning from one highly regarded guy in Helsinki and have it all “look and seem fine”. Then it took about two years to get everything roughly together and then I spent about a year more to put the studio together properly with wiring and everything, getting the sound together and so on.</p>\n<p>Having done it all it’s really quite remarkable. It’s so much work and financial pressure and so on, I will pay for it for the rest of my life but then again it’s something I really wanted to create, my own place somewhere where I feel comfortable living and being creative, not having a landlord and all such stuff around, neighbours etc.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the island like in general? Having lived in Berlin do you find it nice to be in an environment not so saturated with other musicians and producers?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s ideal for me. It’s really quite isolated and remote but then again it is accessible relatively easily, considering how wild and isolated the spot you actually are in.</p>\n<p>It’s for the large part a nature reserve for wildlife, mainly migrating birds. It’s the biggest island in Finland, it’s rather spacious. There’s enough people to have some kind of community, and the basic needs are covered. I think it’s beautiful as anything, I very much enjoy living there.</p>\n<p>For me it’s not really possible to compare Berlin and Hailuoto, one is what I want and like and was craving for, and the other was what I wanted to get away from. I never went to Berlin for the scene and all this stuff it’s famous for, my now-wife was living there back then and we wanted to move together and the other option was Helsinki which I was getting very bored of at that time.</p>\n<p>I create and shine in isolation. I need my space, I don’t need interaction or interruption or hassle or trendy stuff and so forth around me when I create but the opposite. I do interact and socialise when traveling, I get to do the city things during travels and I get input from various sources but when I work most of it just becomes a disturbance.</p>\n<p><strong>One of your other projects is working as part of the Moritz Von Oswald Trio. How did you first hook up with Moritz Van Oswald &amp; Max Loderbauer, and is the project harder to  keep up with these days given your relocation to Finland?</strong></p>\n<p>I actually stopped the project from my side some months ago. For me it has come time to do other stuff, time is so limited. I’ve known Moritz since 15 years ago and it was his idea to try a band setting and he brought Max in as well and that’s how I got to know Max.</p>\n<p>I worked with the group for five years while living in Finland, most of the group’s active period so I don’t think the location played such a role. Of course if everyone lived in Berlin you could rehearse or hang out more but I’m not sure if that’s always to the benefit of music.</p>\n<p>**There is an audiovisual installation from yourself and Vito Acconci, at the Kiasma museum of contemporary art currently, can you tell us a little bit about how this came about, and what people can expect from the piece? **</p>\n<p>The piece with Vito is actually a one-day thing taking place on November 16th. I also made three permanent sound pieces for the museum by myself.</p>\n<p>But the Vito collaboration, that’s going to be interesting. I don’t know yet what will come out of it but the concept is to create a full-day performance-installation and do it in an open-source way where there’s really no beginning and end of an official piece, but instead we’ll begin building it up and at some point it’s rolling and then at some point we’ll gradually start taking it down, all these phases won’t be marked or presented with any cues etc. audience can be there and see us starting in the morning while we try to figure out the piece together. Of course there’s going to be preparation some days beforehand, it’s not all freestyle as it involves video and lights and of course audio in various ways.</p>\n<p>I have always liked Vito and his work and we’ve known each other a little bit since years ago and wanted to do something together since a while but didn’t really find a suitable setting until now.</p>\n<p>**Can you see yourself working more closely with visual artists in the future? **</p>\n<p>I have no clear idea or rules what I want to do or what not. It really depends on the person and project and context. But surely I could imagine working with visual artists and collaborating as long as it’s something interesting. If it’s a new thing it is welcomed by itself, usually things and projects where you don’t know much work best, there’s no routine there’s no knowledge to base upon. Virginal territories.</p>\n<p><strong>Following the ‘week in the studio’ pictures on your Facebook has been pretty interesting - In total how many instruments do you own? Do you find it inspiring to use unconventional, and perhaps unfamiliar equipment?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/10421541004/\" title=\"Vladislav Delay Tech by straylandings, on Flickr\" target=\"_blank\"><img align=\"right\" alt=\"Vladislav Delay Tech\" src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3689/10421541004_a049e6dd50.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/></a></p>\n<p>I have collected some amount of instruments along the years but I’m not a collector. I only keep stuff I like the sound of and the feel of.</p>\n<p>Overall I find unconventional and unfamiliar the things that work for me. If it’s not such a thing I’ll make it one, one way or another. I absolutely have no interest in conventional music or musical things, I have nothing to say in such a generic context, I get bored immediately, and the world is more than full of it already, sadly.</p>\n<p>I try to challenge myself in various ways, and one is via sound, trying to find interesting sounds. and I really don’t care from where and how they come about. I don’t conceptualise or theorise, I just go for the results and follow instincts. Whatever works. But yes, I find real items, be it musical instrument or anything else, a great source of sound. when mic’d and processed the variety and range of sound is huge compared to analog or digital sound generation which is more limited no matter what blinking lights you have going on.</p>\n<p><strong>I also wanted to ask about your background as a classical percussionist, do you think there is an element of tension in the music you make with your formal training? You quite often work with unconventional rhythmic patterns.</strong></p>\n<p>It’s difficult to say. Part of me thinks training and learning, “supposed” things just makes for bad music. But then again, when I listen to most of the electronic music I feel there’s no musical thinking behind it but it’s just a sporty act or something funny or whatever, and it’d be good for the producer or artist to spend time listening other kind of music for a while and learn about whatever music form there is; just learn musical languages which is unfortunately based on lots of rules one should not take for granted. So I guess it’s about learning the rules and then learning to forget the rules.</p>\n<p>I spent as much time unlearning and protesting against everything I learnt as I did learning all of it, which both is a lot. I don’t regret having learnt anything, I truly believe in knowledge and experience.</p>\n<p>But also most of the unconventional rhythmic stuff, as you call it, started only coming about after I realised I had studied and learnt so much and it all meant nothing musically, it was just generic stuff no matter how deep into this or that niche I went into, that it was just a realisation that there’s a door to open if only I left all of the learnt stuff away. Of course it’s hard to forget what you have learnt but I’m trying to get that door still open, I know it’s there. Nowadays I think it’s not about trying to forget or ignore what you know and have learnt but not pay any attention to it and not letting it rule what you’re trying to do and achieve.</p>\n<p>**Finally, the debut release from ‘Heisenberg’, your project with Max Lodenbauer is up next on the Ripatti imprint, what can people expect from the release? **</p>\n<p>There’s already a short sample on Ripatti Label SoundCloud. Heisenberg stuff is pretty wild studio/gear exploration. It’s pretty fast tempo again… It’s mostly live jams in the studio we did when Max visited Hailuoto, and I’ve been producing/mixing it together afterwards. It’s quite unique and original considering how conventional stuff it’s based on. There’s often straight rhythmic stuff going on and it’s slowly evolving stuff but there’s something somewhat mad there I like.</p>\n<p>There will be a range of music coming out on the label. 03 is a Vladislav Delay EP, rather experimental rhythmic stuff while 04 is a collaboration with a producer named Teeth, and those tracks are more club-like, at least in my book. Then again there’ll be more odd stuff as well.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/11823436\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Breaking out in the late 90s, the bulk of Skoog’s work under his own name tapped into the oft-forgotten yet hyper productive early naughties era of techno. Having released numerous high-tempo slammers on Global Trax and Sweden’s Native Diffusion (and later Adam Beyer’s Drumcode), Skoog’s recent work with his well known Agaric moniker has followed the shift towards a slower more minimal sound. Considering this sonic-biography it is somewhat odd that <em>Exit Earth’s</em> understated character sees Skoog returning to his own name after a 5-year hiatus.</p>\n<p>In an interview for Ibiza Voice Skoog lamented the homogeneity in the hard and fast structure of his early releases. <em>Exit Earth</em> undoubtedly feels like an antidote to this arguably unfair self-criticism. The sprawling 11-track album suitably explores the theme of space travel, more specifically the expeditions of NASA’s Voyager program. Though the specificity of the theme might be lost on the listener, the airy production and reverb drenched synth repetitions inescapably set the album’s gaze on the cosmos.</p>\n<p>Skoog is thorough. <em>Exit Earth</em> does a noble job of realizing the theme, utilizing a restrained sound palette the album is articulated as a unified statement. The press release is unflinching in its assertion that this is not a retrospective album yet <em>Exit Earth</em> is by no means a total rupture from his previous repertoire. The more subtle tracks like the excellent ‘Death of a Pulsar’ do explore new ground but to me the tough groves that run throughout the album recall earlier Detroit sounds rather than the clinical claps and cold booms of Berlin.</p>\n<p>There should be no mistake <em>Exit Earth</em> is not retro. At the most tracks like ‘Voyager 1’ are slightly more self-referential then the album’s future-conscious intentions might imply. As opposed to its somewhat vague theme, what really defines <em>Exit Earth</em> is Skoog’s ability to utilize familiar sounds with care and restraint, crafting them into a definitive and dance-floor ready statement.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/8902610\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Listening through their individual releases it isn’t hard to see why they are so effective together - both displaying a penchant for darkly mechanical Techno. The latest release on Speedy J’s Electric Deluxe see’s the pair join forces once again, delivering a hazy three track EP entitled ‘Foreign Awake Pt.1’.</p>\n<p>The duo have clearly given some serious consideration to the outlet of their latest release, channeling their sound towards the slow-burning warehouse Techno Electric Deluxe has become known for. There are also some more direct parallels to be drawn between this release and Hans Bouffmyhre’s 12” which populated the label most recently, namely in the mediation struck between hard-hitting dancefloor percussion and deeper atmospheric textures.</p>\n<p>Intoxicating high-end atmospheres and shuddering low-end make up the basis of opener ‘Texture 3’, the lack of mid-range textures giving the track a sense of weightlessness. Vapourous shuffled hi-hats echo between barely discernible arpeggios, subtly carving out structure through the track.</p>\n<p>The sense of uneasy displacement throughout the track is something also common to the EPs subsequent offerings, perhaps caused by the absence of snares. Whilst this may not seem like a massive omission, it leaves the listener with a sense of discomfort as Sawlin &amp; Subjected’s earthshaking rhythms feel totally ungrounded.</p>\n<p>This disquieted feeling is palpable through ‘Texture 4’, as jarring kick drums puncture the layers of gaseous ambience. A shrill melodic riff runs the duration of the track, with noisey high-end percussion serving to increase the tension even more.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most straight forward offering on the release is it’s closer, ‘Texture 2’s distinctive kick drum pattern giving the track a much more conventional sense of groove. Off-beat tom drums also go some way in filling the gap left my the lack of snares, as delicate, enchanting melodies dance across the track’s eight minute duration.</p>\n<p>'Foreign Awake Pt.1' highlights a versatility in Sawlin &amp; Subjected's efforts in its deviation from their usual affront, industrial edged take on Techno. Here they opt for something much subtle and gradually evolving, leaving us with my anticipation for the release's next component, 'Foreign Awake Pt.2'.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F12190780\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>The last twelve months seem to have been rather pivotal for Bob Bhamra, the man behind the assorted operations of West Norwood Cassette Library. The label frontier of the project made the step up to the 12” EP format at the tail-end of last year, and 2013 has seen host to a further four EPs of WNCL branded House &amp; Techno, from the likes of Bobby Champs, Spatial, Kamikaze Space Programme and most recently Pennyroyal affiliate, J.Tijn.</p>\n<p>The closing months of this year will also see several of Bhamra’s own projects coming to fruition, with a Plastic Soul EP (Bhamra’s collaboration with Paul Bateman) scheduled for release on WNCL later this month, as well as a double EP due out in December with Alex Jones’ Hypercolour imprint.</p>\n<p>We caught up with Bhamra recently to discuss dubplates, the forthcoming releases, and doing things the Cassette Library way.</p>\n<p><strong>Although not always working under the West Norwood Cassette Library moniker, you have been releasing music since the mid-1990s (as far as your discogs profiles tell). What were your original influences in making music, and how have they changed over the years?</strong></p>\n<p>Hmmm. I’m in danger of boring you to death with my first answer – the list of mavericks, legends, genres, producers, DJs and tracks that have influenced and inspired is endless.</p>\n<p>If something is profound enough to influence and inspire you to make music, chances are it’s going to stick around in your life for a while and that’s very much the case for me.</p>\n<p><strong>Plastic Soul is another of your projects, that had a couple of releases in the late 1990s /early 2000s. Can you tell us a little bit about it?</strong></p>\n<p>Plastic Soul is a collaboration between me and my good old friend Paul Bateman that has taken on many guises over the years – we’ve dabbled in 60’s-influenced Garage and Psych, put out a Jungle 12” on Flex back in ‘97 and are now about to release a four track EP of House tracks on WNCL.</p>\n<p>We’re both very particular people – extremely fussy about all the elements that go into making a track – so this was never going to be a quick project to finish. It does mean that we both have complete satisfaction regardless of how the record is received. Which is pretty much the modus operandi for anything that comes out on the label.</p>\n<p><strong>You are one of the few DJs who still choose to cut dubplates to mix with, despite the high cost and limited durability. Where does your commitment to the physical format come from?</strong></p>\n<p>I’ve never bothered to learn to DJ with anything other than vinyl and dubplates purely and simply because I still really like vinyl and dubplates. So, if there’s something unreleased, my only option is to cut plates.</p>\n<p>The other option, of course, is to be practical, learn how to use CDJ’s and save myself a heap of money, but where’s the fun in that? I’m not on a mission to convert the world back to vinyl and I’m not anti-digital but it’s fair to say that I still get a sense of excitement when I cut new tracks to dub that I don’t get from merely playing an MP3. That’s my curse and I’ve learnt to live with it.</p>\n<p><strong>We touched on some of the issues of being a vinyl only DJ earlier in our email exchange; are poorly maintained decks something you come to expect when playing out?</strong></p>\n<p>I still get very nervous before a gig. It used to just be the fear of looking like a dick while everyone watches me playing records. Now, it’s more the fear of looking like a dick while everyone watches me <em>not</em> playing records. I keep getting told that I could easily avoid this by learning how to DJ by other means but I just don’t really fancy it – I’d rather not do the gig.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s your production setup like? Your music has quite a raw analogue feel to it as though it there may be some hardware involved, although this may be a trick of the ear.</strong></p>\n<p>I don’t really have any allegiance to analogue or digital, hardware or software. I’m the worst person to talk to about gear and production techniques – I still can’t wire a plug without a manual. The track writing process can be a hair pulling exercise because the studio is full of cheap rubbish that’s really only fit for the bin, but I’m fond of it and the sound it produces. It is what it is.</p>\n<p><strong>You have a double pack 12” upcoming on Hypercolour - How did this come about, and what can we expect on the release?</strong></p>\n<p>Jamie Russell at Hypercolour approached me a few years back to do <em>something</em> together and we eventually agreed on the idea for this project. It’s an eight track double 12” that’s made up of tracks that I’ve been keeping back as secret weapons on dubplate for ages.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you see the Hypercolour release as a collection of singles or should it be treated like a more cohesive EP?</strong></p>\n<p>Both. To me it sounds like a collection of singles gathered together to make a cohesive EP although I wouldn’t say there’s a deliberate narrative or any particular concept to it.</p>\n<p><strong>You changed your release format on the label side of WNCL from 10” singles to 12”, four track EPs at the start of the year. What prompted the change in format?</strong></p>\n<p>Partly to get more of an artists work on one bit of vinyl and partly because my inner OCD demon was telling me to stop at ten 10” releases.</p>\n<p><strong>The last release on the label was from Pennyroyal affiliate J.Tijn, and comes from a more melodic, house oriented angle than his previous releases. How did the release come about ?</strong></p>\n<p>J got in touch via SoundCloud a couple of years back and has been sending me tracks since then. I was immediately excited by “Decimated #4” (at that stage, it was a 140bpm heart attack) and then his “The Anti-Mixdown” release on Turbo really pricked up my ears.</p>\n<p>By the time we eventually got to talking about a release on WNCL, the two Pennyroyal records were in the works. They had a very definitive style so it seemed obvious to use the WNCL EP to showcase another side of J Tijn.</p>\n<p>Much like the other releases, the process also involves a period of getting to know each other. Not essential but a pleasant side effect of working with good people. We really started to pull the EP together after we’d met and had a few ciders outside The Blue Posts (unofficial WNCL HQ).</p>\n<p>**Was it a long process to get the final four tracks confirmed? **</p>\n<p>It was similar to the other 12” EP releases on the label in that it took quite a while to reach the point where we both agreed that we had the best possible, strongest set of tracks to unleash unto the world. I’m too uptight and fussy and protective of the label to be able to say to an artist “Just give me four tracks and let’s do a record”…and luckily for me, I’ve had the pleasure of working with producers who will humour me on that.</p>\n<p>**WNCL is free from Twitter or Facebook profiles, and any updates are transmitted through your blog. What is the reasoning behind keeping WNCL free from social network sites? **</p>\n<p>Again, it’s just personal choice. I’m not trying to make a statement by avoiding them nor do I feel any obligation to sign up to anything just because it’s what might be expected of me.</p>\n<p>Like everything else we’ve been talking about – cutting plates, playing vinyl, having a dysfunctional studio etc. etc. I’m aware that people may consider my approach to be naïve but I’d rather carry on as I am for now. I’m still managing to get gigs, produce tracks and run a label without bashing people over the head every five minutes on Facebook and Twitter.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally what’s in store for the Cassette Library over the rest of 2013?</strong></p>\n<p>The Plastic Soul EP comes out on WNCL in November and the 8 Track Cartridge EP on Hypercolour in December, so that pretty much takes care of the rest of the year.</p>\n<p>Label mate, Don Froth, will also be releasing his Re-Flexed EP on his own Froth’n imprint before the year’s out – that one has remixes from me and Anthony ‘Shake’ Shakir.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/113083117\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Her latest record ‘Eyes Are Blind’ is evidence to this, the BPitch Control released EP traversing three hypnotic cuts of dub-infused warehouse Techno.</p>\n<p>Given the tripped out, minimal inspired trappings of her ‘Silk &amp; Metal’ EPs, or 2009’s ‘The Fresh Flash’, it’s clear that Calvani has made quite a notable sonic journey in a relatively short period of time. Whilst the hallmarks of Dub-Techno, and a penchant for leftfield atmospherics are still present, ‘Eyes Are Blind’ inhabits a deeper space more suited to mesmerising swaying crowds in the early hours.</p>\n<p>Not that I’ve tried it yet, but opener and title track ‘Eyes Are Blind’ feels like it might be less straight forward to mix than it first appears. Just as you begin to adjust to the awkward rolling toms which open the track, it’s groove is unsettled by a thudding kick pattern creating dizzying polyrhythms. As it progresses a pointed synth riff fades into the mix, joined by indiscernible low pitched vocal samples.</p>\n<p>Proceeding with the same slow-burning intent yet moving into darker territories, ‘Look Deep’ is something of a highlight. An effortlessly infectious drum pattern is capitalised on by subtle atmospherics and rugged sound-design calling to mind Psyk’s 2010 released track, ‘Crypt’. The fact these percussive elements are left dry makes the impact all the more powerful as menacing synthesisers drop out suddenly through the track’s various rising builds.</p>\n<p>Concluding the EP, ‘Awake’ is the most melodically rooted, and also perhaps the most optimistic offering of the release. A slightly detuned staccato melody runs its duration, as vapourous percussion and warm, ethereal chords creep into the mix simultaneously.</p>\n<p>Whilst ‘Eyes Are Blind’ may be the first release from Calvani in a few years, given the maturing of her sound it signifies, the Italian born-artist has progressed further than many artists do in the same time-period, generating much due anticipation as to her next move.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/94645501\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Luckily for us however WNCL017 see’s the collaborative project of Paul Bateman &amp; WNCL frontman Bob Bhamra brought out of retirement to deliver a four track EP of deeply soulful, rough-edged House music.</p>\n<p>If asked about the musical direction of the WNCL imprint, ‘I Got It’, the opening track to this latest EP might not act as a bad summation of the label’s overall aesthetic. Raw, Garage-infused drum work, shuffles brazenly between blasts of speaker rattling low-end. Intoxicating washes of synth are introduced at the midpoint, at first showcased individually before combining with the track’s rumbling bass and half-sung vocal-samples in the closing third.</p>\n<p>A similarly robust bassline is deployed through following track ‘Holdin’ On’, following a steady, euphoria-inducing build up. Blissful, filtered chords and before a distant vocal outcry heralds the release of tension created by the aforementioned jaunty bassline. The combination of these elements is really rather infectious without being overcomplicated. Despite the fact the EP is rich in melodies and a creative use of sampling, there is still a no-nonsense feel to it - the different components used feel as if they have been picked for specific functions, with no more baggage than is absolutely necessary.</p>\n<p>Third track ‘Mint Imperial’ is testament to this. Knife-edge chords reminiscent of those of Wax’s’ 20002’, stabs between a rollicking combination of bass and drums, occasionally extending their sequence further during stammered breakdowns.</p>\n<p>Given the other offerings’ peak-time thrills, closing track ‘Body Form’ feels decidedly more settled, laid-back organ echoing between a meandering bass riff and the occasional diced up vocal.</p>\n<p>Through its playful, no frills approach to the genre, WNCL017 makes a nice reassertion of the raw, jacking House values that were so prominent in the earlier days of the label. Here’s to hoping this release heralds a rejuvenation of the Plastic Soul project at large.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F113083117\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>“<em>Raj</em> was sort of my attempt at making an all-out “noise” record, very personal and no holds barred.” Polish born, now New England residing sound-artist Derek Piotr says of his third album. “I had begun working on the record after I recorded voice and organ in a cathedral with a countertenor singer for a separate project. While in that space we also played with the huge resonance – stomping and clapping and chanting. The stomps and organ are the first thing you hear on the record, in “Spine”. It grew from there. My original image for the album was Kali razing all of Manhattan with the Empire State Building in her hand… I wanted the record to sound like steel being destroyed.”</p>\n<p>As Quietus co-founder John Doran pointed out in a recent review, the range of influences audible in Piotr’s work is quite astounding. As well as an obvious industrial influence, he also cites Eastern music, M.I.A.’s <em>Kala,</em> and Black Pus as impacting on the production of the album.</p>\n<p><object height=\"360\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=57042521&force_embed=1&server=vimeo.com&show_title=0&show_byline=0&show_portrait=0&color=ffffff&fullscreen=1&autoplay=0&loop=0\"></object></p>\n<p>Amongst these assorted reference points, it is the twenty-two year old’s own voice which acts as the constant through the record. ”My earliest experiments in 2007 involved calling my friend up (he had a microphone, I didn’t) and singing or speaking/rapping over the phone to him.” he explains. “He had a mac, so it was built with GarageBand 2.0 or something. He would auto-tune the shit out of whatever I did and email it to me at like 128 MP3…I would then slice it up the way I liked in Audacity. This obviously produced some really strange distortions… Later on I began listening to the work of Maja Ratkje and AGF, and, later, Laurie Anderson and Meredith Monk. I was Monk’s intern in 2010. The most important thing that I took away from that period was the realisation that words do not matter, or very little. 80% of my output I would say is wordless, although I use my voice on every track I release.”</p>\n<p>Another artist to inspire Piotr’s avante-garde use of vocals was Antye Greie, who ended up mastering <em>Raj,</em> at her husband Sasu Ripatti (Vladislav Delay)’s ‘Shark Reef’ studio in Finland. ”Antye and I have been friends for five years. I am guilty of being one of the first teenagers to grow up faced with the internet age – so instead of my awful demos collecting under a bed in a shoebox, the shoebox was the web. I started putting out music under an alias in 2007, and in 2008 I heard ‘Head Slash Bauch’ by AGF. I was already cutting my voice up on my own, but hearing Antye push that particular aesthetic really gave me hope and inspiration. I wrote her, and, after sending her dozens of terrible demos for a few years, she agreed to engineer my debut record, AGORA, which came out in 2011. I am very lucky that one of my favourite musicians is also someone I can count as a friend, and even have had a working relationship with. When I completed Raj I realised Antye was the one who would understand this kind of sound.”</p>\n<p>Piotr’s mix for us draws from a diverse range of styles, going someway to explaining the influences behind the album and his work at large.</p>\n<p>&quot;The first thing you hear in the mix is the vocal stem to one of the tracks on my next record…that will come in 2014, that track in particular is called “Yogyakarta”. I began working a lot with gamelan samples for this album, kind of a continuity of <em>Raj</em>, and I sing a few tracks with just vowel sounds, to figure out a melody. I liked the vocal take so much I decided to keep it – but then though it might be in poor taste, skinny white boy gibbering over “world music” seemed tacky. I was on the fence. I was searching for a title for the record and I knew it had to be Indonesian, so as I went through online translators I realised some of the sounds I had made correlated to Bahasa. I became curious and transcribed both the gibberish tracks and to my great surprise they were all legitimate, coherent Indonesian. Was I possessed by a Sufi?!!! I almost don’t believe it myself, but it was a huge revelation to find this out.</p>\n<p>Following that, there is a chant from Nuristani women in Afghanistan, which I have loved for a long time. The Nuristani practiced an ancient form of Hinduism before being converted to Islam, which is something I find relatable for this new record…again I mention Kali quite a bit and she is a goddess sometimes shared by both Hindu and Muslim people. She is greatly revered in Indonesia, which was one of my main inspirations for writing the album.”</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/58804313?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0&color=ffffff\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<p>This is followed by some of Piotr’s more recent listening tastes.</p>\n<p>&quot;Yoko Ono, M.I.A., Omar Soulemyan and AGF all have records out this year, which is very exciting to me. Yoko Ono’s track is actually a dance hit, which is hilarious to me because she’s 80 now. She’s still quite vibrant, I really respect her spirit and for not making workout music. Coming off of that, I chose some old favourite that I always seem to pull out around this time of year, Gregor Samsa, Stephen Scott, some Gregorian Chant, and the new Forest Swords which was one of the first producer-helmed records to come by in a long time that really genuinely fascinated me.&quot;</p>\n<p>_Raj _having been released February this year, it’s been a little while since Piotr’s last release, however this isn’t reflective of his work rate. “There is work with a countertenor that I began in late 2011, it should come in early 2014.” he explains when asked about forthcoming material. “Also my fourth solo record, which I mentioned above. That record focuses heavily on the use of gamelan, and, this time around, lyrics, though used in a repetitive, mantra-like way. It was a challenge to myself to use words on most of it after doing the opposite…also in the works is a split EP with Paul Heslin, a low key noisy experiment between friends. that should be out very shortly.”</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Derek Piotr // Yogyakarta (Acapella) [Unreleased]</li>\n<li>Afghanistan VA // Nuristani Women’s Song [Uknown]</li>\n<li>M.I.A. // Y.A.L.A.

His oddly seductive post-apocalyptic sound meshes influences from techno, drone and ambient whilst managing to avoid settling into any one compartment with ease.</p>\n<p>Given how immersive, and vivid Kerridge’s EPs have been, it was only a matter of time before the British-born artist should turn his attention to a full-length offering as he does here with <em>A Fallen Empire.</em> The LP comes via Regis’ Downwards imprint, with which Kerridge has found a fitting home for his sound, slotting neatly into the label’s diverse roster and post-punk aesthetic.</p>\n<p>The fact he has chosen to rest his hat here seems even less surprising given his sound seems to draw on the sonic tendencies Regis and the rest of Sandwell District have employed in the past. Monotonous, grinding low-end for example, is a feature present throughout _A Fallen Empire, _right from stoic opening track ‘Chant’ to the shuddering closer, ‘Disgust’, and is a feature similar to that frequented by Rrose through tracks like ‘Secretion’.</p>\n<p>In a recent interview with Electronic Beats, Kerridge stated how the record had been constructed during an uncomfortably long, dark Berlin winter. This image is definitely easy to evoke listening through. The abrasive, brittle low-end of ‘Black Sun’ for example feeling particularly frostbitten as it mercilessly overshadows the distant, gregorian wailings which open the track.</p>\n<p>This track is perhaps the closest thing I’ve heard to an outright drone track from Kerridge, and from here the LP seems to slowly build up its rhythmic components reaching it’s peak with the ferocious ‘Scare Tactics’. Snarling mid-range grates between frantic claps and pounding kicks and cymbals in an offering that feels significantly more energetic than his lumbering, waterlogged offerings such as stone-faced following track ‘Heavy Metal’.</p>\n<p>Very early on in the album it becomes easy to fall into a trance-like state thanks to its brooding, hypnotic appeal. This is perhaps unsurprising given how richly textured a record this is, _A Fallen Empire _making a fitting title for an album that so readily conjures images of crumbling ruins and barren-wastelands.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/13573395\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

This said, the London based artist has never been one to buy into the clichéd mechanics of self promotion, eschewing glossy press shots and contrived marketing campaigns instead choosing to let his music speak for itself. Given this, its perhaps little surprise that the second contribution to the vinyl-only imprint appeared by equally humble methods, being premiered (in part) through Hessle Audio’s weekly Rinse.fm slot.</p>\n<p>At the time of his debut with the then recently reincarnated R&amp;S Records, the element that stood out most to me in his productions were the delicate, and incredibly restrained rhythmic elements. This latest record sees Sigsworth venture even deeper into the realms of percussive minimalism - his rhythmic elements feel like a ghost even of the skeletal structures they were before.</p>\n<p>Melancholic strings open a-side ‘Gulf’, calling to mind the murky gothic soundscapes of an act like Raime. There is something about Sigsworth’s throbbing bass and barely-there percussion however that serves as constant reminder that he is approaching things from a totally different perspective - his background of taking inspiration from Deep Medi era dubstep records is still audible. In the closing minutes of the track a downtrodden vocal sample hinted at in the rest of the track is revealed in its entirety, adding context to Sigsworth carefully crafted soundscapes.</p>\n<p>B-side ‘Strafe’ is another shadowy affair. Clattering percussion stumbles gently beneath low-end drones and downtrodden strings similar to those featured in ‘Gulf’. On a handful of occasions sharp cuts of string sample perforate the dense, sullen atmospheres Sigsworth has built up around them. As with his previous releases, ‘Strafe’ is a real masterclass in sampling, and the record in general retains Sigsworth’s incredibly unique approach to production.</p>\n<p>Setting up an imprint to serve your own productions in an age of such fierce competition is a bold move for any producer, however the creative freedom it has facilitated Sigsworth shows that in this case it was clearly more than worth the risk.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/13888596\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>With only a handful of releases, Margaret Dygas has made an astonishing impression on the world of Techno over the last few years. In particular, her brilliant ‘Invisible Circles’ 12” as well as her 2011 self-titled album wowed critiques with their unique simplicity and haunting undertones.</p>\n<p>With a performance in Fabric’s Room 1 scheduled for this coming Saturday, we caught up with Margaret earlier in the week to discuss her history with the club, Michael Jackson, and the ‘minimal’ tag.</p>\n<p>**First off, you’re playing at Fabric on the 16<strong><strong>th</strong></strong>, any other artists you’re particularly looking forward to seeing perform that evening? **</p>\n<p>I’m really looking forward to play at Fabric! It’s really special for me at least, because of my long history with the place.</p>\n<p>Who I’d like to see play? Everyone! I’m really happy to see my friend Nicolas [Lutz] playing in Room 1, i think it’s his first time playing there, so I’m super excited for him, and of course I’m curious about Brandt Brauer Frick, although they are from Berlin it will be the first time I’ll see them. There is a video on Youtube where they performed with Om’Mas Keith, it looked like an amazing show.</p>\n<p>Toi Toi in Room 3, I love Room 3! I know Ion and David (Dewalta) from Berlin and will be popping up there during the night, no doubt.</p>\n<p>Room 2 looks bombastic! No need to say more. I’ll definitely go to see Terry [Francis], get a hug and bounce a bit ;). And of course Craig [Richards], it will be nice to be around him and play by his side. Good vibrations!</p>\n<p><strong>Aside from that brilliant remix for the Cosmos imprint earlier this year it’s been a little while since your last release. What have you been up to over the last few months? Any new projects you can tell us a bit about?</strong></p>\n<p>Thank you so much for the kind word on the Cosmos release. My dear friend Tobias and I did something recently that will be out on his label Non Standard Productions.</p>\n<p><strong>So that will be a break from your long history of solo releases - do you find it easier to work in isolation?</strong></p>\n<p>[Isolation] can be a form of rehabilitation, a much needed meditation for more inspiration :) Working alone means true freedom of your own expression, rather than constantly thinking of someone else’s taste, which could be a bit of a waste of your own time.</p>\n<p>I really do like working with friends and sharing ideas, and I wish this would happen more often, but it’s never planned… it just happens, and that is what really like about it.</p>\n<p><strong>Your tracks are rather sample heavy - how do you go about sourcing these? Am I right in saying a lot of your music contains samples of instruments you’ve recorded yourself?</strong></p>\n<p>Of course I do… it’s a bit of a strange question. Too easy not to, right?! All you need is a mic and any sound can be used as an instrument.</p>\n<p><strong>So what sort of records do you listen to outside of the dance music sphere?</strong></p>\n<p>Lots of different stuff. I order on Amazon sometimes, something slightly familiar can take you on to a new discovery. For me it also depends on how I’m feeling or how I would like to feel. Tibetan singing bowls are really nice for the morning. I find Police Greatest Hits or U2 great for painting walls and cleaning. I love James Blake and Fink, always’n 4-eva. A bit of Jazz is really great, especially paired with a glass of warm milk! There are so many record shops in my neighbourhood alone… it’s a never ending story, easy to find something - something…old or new, whatever. I also love Michael Jackson, he hangs out here sometimes… well, at least once a week ;). He puts me in a good mood every time. If you’re a fan like me there is an amazing mix free to download <a href=\"http://www.jperiod.com/mj/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>PYT!</p>\n<p>**You have quite a minimal, restrained sound - Where do you think this aspect of your music comes from? **</p>\n<p>I love minimal sounds for their delicate nature, lightness in texture, transparency, piercing frequencies and even the annoying qualities. The sounds can be beautiful, really horrible or barely noticeable. You can layer the sounds like lasagna under a thick cheese topping for only you to know about. Maybe some other sound freak will notice them, only because of his particular obsession for passion.</p>\n<p>But I feel like the word “Minimal” will never find peace… Minimal shminimal :) People seem to desperately want to divide up music into categories. If someone makes a techno record, does that make them a techno producer? On the other hand, wanting to categorize is human nature and makes it easier for us to define who we are, and that is fine if it makes you happy. Wanting to have some kind of guideline for things you like is normal, all good! Just try not to get stuck in your own narrow point of view, when there is an ocean out there :).</p>\n<p><strong>Having lived in a range of different cities, do you think the nomadic lifestyle of a DJ is well suited to you? Is it strange coming back to places you have lived in previously (like London) for just a night or two when playing shows?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s not strange at all. I don’t think about it anymore. I really love Berlin. I am very grateful for the fact that I can travel, visit my old hoods, see old friends, make new friends, share good times, if only for a few hours. I see it as a dream come true or even an illusion, maybe like everything else.</p>\n<p>Big hugs everyone! Keep warm!</p>\n<p>**Catch Margaret Dygas at Fabric on Saturday 16<strong><strong>th</strong></strong> November along with Craig Richards, Ben Sims and Planetary Assault Systems. **</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"40\" src=\"http://official.fm/player?width=100%25&amp;height=40&amp;skin_bg=000000&amp;skin_fg=FFFFFF&amp;aspect=flat&amp;control=1&amp;feed=http%3A%2F%2Fofficial.fm%2Ffeed%2Ftracks%2F2hlN.json\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Here the duo apply their talents at crafting immersive soundscapes to three individual tracks, with the help of fellow Italians Retina.it, and Daniele De Santis, otherwise known as Grün.</p>\n<p>As with Dadub’s prior releases, the influence of Dub-Techno is clear throughout the release, yet each track comes with a ferocity and directness arguably rarely present in the genre.</p>\n<p>The pairs talent at creating texturally rich sound-design has always been a hallmark of their productions, this feature remaining equally prominent through opening track ‘Mistresses March’. A frenzy of tumbling, lo-fi drums pound through the opening layers of distant atmospheres and grainy radio-static, slowly working into a frenzy of rumbling distortion.</p>\n<p>Abrasive high-end textures persist through ‘Kykeon’, a collaboration utilising <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/74599618\">this</a> incredible modular-system designed by another Italian duo, Retina.it. Mysterious, synthesised ambience opens the track, before these rather auspicious textures manoeuvre into darker territories as the track progresses, revealing a cavernous low-end swelling beneath the rolling drums and harshly filtered noise.</p>\n<p>The hissing, tension fraught, ‘Ergot Kernel’ sees Dadub in collaboration once again, this time joining forces with Berlin based Daniele De Santis, otherwise known as Grün. The track finishes the EP at full-throttle, droning, discordant tones become barely audible beneath the track’s invasive, pummelling rhythms.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/117408613\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>&quot;The project started out as an idea for a live show&quot; Mike Jefford begins in offering up an explanation of his Positive Centre project. &quot;In preparation I had bought some new power adapters for various bits and pieces I wanted to use. To get things working, I had to switch the polarity on them to match the bit of equipment it was for - most of which were configured as ‘positive centre’. It stuck in my head and made sense with how I hear the music - so when I sent the first bunch of recordings out they were all under that name.  &quot;</p>\n<p>Following from his initial enquiries, Jefford managed to secure himself a release with Sigha’s renowned Our Circula Sound imprint earlier this year. “Last Autumn I’d started putting together a new Live show for Hayley and Sam Kerridge’s Contort party in Berlin.” he begins when asked about the occurrence of the six-track EP. “During the sound check my drum machine was shorting out, so I took everything back home, recorded all the stems and ended up with a load of new tracks. I sent James ‘An Assembly’, which he liked enough to ask me to do the EP.”</p>\n<p>As might be deductible from the production standards of the debut Positive Centre record, the release doesn’t mark Jefford’s first foray into production. ”I first started out with fruity loops and sonic foundry acid when I was a teenager, but it was only when I started using hardware and leaving the computer to do the editing that I found my feet with it.” he expands.</p>\n<p>Despite having worked and released under a few different alias’ in the past however, Positive Centre marks a concerted effort to express particular memories and ideas. “For me its about capturing the intangible, remembered feelings, old thoughts and things you’ve half forgotten. I’ve never been particularly good at describing this in words, so I find sound is the best way to get these things across.”</p>\n<p>Jefford’s mix for us covers a range of his personal favourites, alongside his own material, taken both from his debut and forthcoming releases. “The release date for my second EP on OCS should be announced soon.  Otherwise I’m in the studio preparing for some upcoming live shows in London and Venice.”</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pierre Henry // Remontée [INA-GRM]</li>\n<li>Prince of Denmark // Sublimation [Forum]</li>\n<li>Demdike Stare // Suspicious Drone [DDS]</li>\n<li>Positive Centre // Untitled</li>\n<li>Geoff Barrow &amp; Ben Salisbury // Dome Horizon [Invada]</li>\n<li>Positive Centre // Thought &amp; Intention [OCS]</li>\n<li>Huerco S. // Plucked from the Ground, Towards the Sun [Software]</li>\n<li>Positive Centre // Swell of Graviton</li>\n<li>Post // Midnight [Skam]</li>\n<li>Cassegrain // Taiga [Prologue]</li>\n<li>Positive Centre // Field of Tongues [OCS]</li>\n<li>Arcing Seas // Amniotic [OCS]</li>\n<li>Positive Centre // The Stations of Section [OCS]</li>\n<li>Marsen Jules // Through Blood and Fire [Oktaf]</li>\n<li>Worn // No Expression [Mira]</li>\n<li>SHXCXCHCXSH // WHTLGHT [Avian]</li>\n<li>Positive Centre // Hiding Knives [OCS]</li>\n<li>Container // Acclimator [Spectrum Spools]</li>\n<li>Positive Centre // Where Flows the How Flows [OCS]</li>\n<li>Sigha // Grace [OCS]</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/stray-landings-mix-series/id556425050?mt=2\">Subscribe in iTunes</a></p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"130\" src=\"//www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?feed=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0024-positive-centre%2F&mini=&stylecolor=&hide_artwork=&embed_type=widget_standard&embed_uuid=60784261-fcf8-451c-9b4a-4c4c85dd9834&hide_tracklist=&hide_cover=1&autoplay=\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/0024-positive-centre/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=resource_link\">0024 // Positive Centre</a> by <a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=profile_link\">Stray Landings</a> on <a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=homepage_link\"> Mixcloud</a></p>\n",

With records as brilliant as 2011’s ‘Trump’ EP with Ed Davenport, as well as a continued residency at the Berghain, we can surely expect Deutschmann to deliver top quality jams well into the foreseeable future. Indeed, his latest EP, ‘Breakdown’, is a perfect example of his mastery, and shows us that he is far from out of steam.</p>\n<p>The EP opens with unapologetic vigor, as enormous 4X4 pulses provide the foundation for ‘Breakdown’s rich 303 lines and hypnotic vocal loops. This is what Deutschmann does best: executing ambitious and busy soundscapes with masses of adrenaline-filled dynamic force. Steve Rachmad’s remix is brilliant in its own right, using a more refrained and understated sound to create those euphoric peaks of dizzying height. This could well be my favourite on the EP.</p>\n<p>‘Braineater’ on the other hand is a hyperactive jaw-clenching burst of energy, always keeping one step ahead of the listener. Tobias, Dettmann and Suckut all spring to mind on this one, as the soft, saintly pads faintly provide a backdrop for the twisted analogue lines and frantic drum machine patterns that move this thing forward. LAD’s remix is considerably more subdued, although it is no less powerful. Providing a subtle shuffle to the beat, the groove bounces along effortlessly, and functions wonderfully as the EP’s closing thought.</p>\n<p>For anyone with even a cursory interest in modern-sounding proggy techno, Oliver Deutschmann is definitely a place worth visiting, and this latest EP serves as another great installment in a long series of excellent releases.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/11020578\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>For the co-founder of a website focussing a significant amount of our attention towards Techno, I haven’t visited Berlin nearly as much as I should. One of the things that stood out most from my handful of pilgrimages however, was a Stroboscopic Artefacts showcase held at Suicide Circus, preceded by the screening of <em>Paris/ Berlin: 20 Years of Underground Techno.</em> It was a remarkably extensive study of the genre, from the early influence of Kraftwerk, all the way through to mainstream acknowledgement. The film’s producer &amp; director, Amélie Ravalec, naturally had her own ties to the Techno scene from before making the film, helping to run label and event series Fondation Sonore alongside her forays into the visual arts.</p>\n<p>Her latest film comes in the form of another genre-study, this time putting focus on the avante-garde music that stemmed from jeopardised Industrial British cities such as Manchester &amp; Sheffield in the 1970s. Entitled ‘<em>Industrial Soundtrack for the Urban Decay</em>' the film expected for release in 2014 boasts a remarkable array of interviews, from Boyd Rice &amp; Cabaret Voltaire to Test Dept. &amp; Throbbing Gristle just to name a few.</p>\n<p>With the release of the film’s trailer expected next week, we caught up with Amélie to discuss the new film, new developments for Fondation Sonore, and the crossovers between Techno and Industrial music.</p>\n<p><strong>So first off how are things? How long have you been working on the film and how does it feel to be in the final stages?</strong></p>\n<p>Great, thank you. Travis and I started working on the film in November 2012. We’re still editing the film, licensing music and applying for funding, but we’re hoping to release the film in 2014.</p>\n<p><strong>Without giving away too much, can you tell us a little bit about the new film and the inspiration behind it</strong>?</p>\n<p>The films features pioneers of the industrial movement such as Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire, SPK, NON, Clock DVA, Test Dept and Z’EV. We also talked to V. Vale, publisher of the influential Industrial Culture Handbook/Re/Search fanzines and Jean-Pierre Turmel, who edits the beautiful fanzine and record label Sordide Sentimental.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7289/10860108076_d353e5c190_z.jpg\" alt=\"Urban Decay\"></p>\n<p>We interviewed contemporary artists and labels that play an important role in today’s industrial scene, such as Winterkalte, label owner of Hands Production, Stefan Alt from Ant-Zen, Orphx, Klinik/Dive. Some of our other favourites industrial acts Click Click, Prima Linea, Hula and In The Nursery are also featured.</p>\n<p>I wanted to make this documentary as I felt this genre and these artists deserved to be exposed to a broader audience. This film is about more than just industrial music, it also reflects on art and history, politics and social issues, post-industrialisation and urban decay.</p>\n<p>I have always been inspired by harsh sounds and industrial architecture, often wandering through decaying cities of Belgium or England. As I dug deeper, I suddenly realized that I shared a lot common influences and preoccupations with those artists, even though they were from a different generation. From a really young age I read books by Burroughs or Ballard and became interested in art movements like the dadaist and the futurists.</p>\n<p><strong>To what extent do you think the success of the first film has helped with this latest project?</strong></p>\n<p>Directing _Paris/Berlin: 20 Years Of Underground Techno _taught me a lot and obviously it made the process easier for the new film.</p>\n<p><strong>I read in an interview done about the Paris/Berlin film you felt there had been plenty of documentaries done about the early days of Techno, but few that came to also include the current scene. Would you say the same sentiments apply with industrial music?</strong></p>\n<p>There has been some good documentaries made about the current industrial scene, such as Maschinenfest and Form of Hands festivals. There has also been documentaries about specific artists or bands too, such as Boyd Rice or Neubauten, however I’m yet to see a detailed documentary about the industrial movement, which is why I decided to make this film.</p>\n<p><strong>During the making of the film did you find yourself discovering crossovers between the two genres?</strong></p>\n<p>Some of the artists I interviewed for Paris/Berlin like Ancient Methods, Adam X or Terence Fixmer are heavily influenced by industrial bands. There are many similarities between `Industrial techno’ and the modern rhythmic noise / industrial scenes although these scenes rarely crossover, which is a shame. I don’t think that classifying music in sub-genres is necessarily a good thing. Good music is good music and hopefully my films and the bands featured can appeal to any music lover.</p>\n<p><strong>You have an amazing set of interviewees included in the film, you must have travelled around a lot! What were some of your favourite places?</strong></p>\n<p>I always loved decaying architecture and industrial cities. Sheffield in particular is somewhere I always wanted to see, even though the city is not as industrial today as it would have been in the 70s. The people were very nice and helpful too and we had a great time both times we visited to shoot interviews. We also travelled to Rouen, a beautiful part of the French countryside, to interview Jean-Pierre Turmel, that was kind enough to show us around the town. Unfortunately we couldn’t afford to travel to America ourselves, but we were lucky enough to have some friends interviewing artists Genesis P. Orridge, SPK and V. Vale on our behalf.</p>\n<p><strong>Was it a struggle to secure some of these people for the film? I’ve heard Test Dept for example rarely give interviews.</strong></p>\n<p>All the artists we interviewed were helpful in the making of the movie. I was surprised by how it all came together so quickly . From the moment we decided to make this film, we were recording interviews less than a month later! I`m not sure about how many interviews Test Dept have done, but they were happy to be featured in the film. We interviewed the band after their concert in Belgium, where they played for the first time in years.</p>\n<p><strong>You are also part of the ‘Fondation Sonore’ label/event series as well, what can we expect to see next from this?</strong></p>\n<p>The next release on the label is the vinyl soundtrack of <em>Paris/Berlin: 20 Years Of Underground Techno</em>. It will be a double vinyl featuring Regis, Adam X, Ancient Methods, Kareem, Oyaarss, Makaton, Archae &amp; Grovskopa and a secret track. We’re also planning a release with Orphx side project O/H, partnering with Huren from Zhark for some beautiful rhythmic noise. Also expect some very interesting newcomers.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/59006321\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

The track’s effortless swung groove is sustained by pulsating low-end and rasping high-end textures. Reeko’s_ Blue Album_ released earlier this year presented a mediation of melodic ideas and dancefloor sensibilities; here however the Spaniard’s efforts are aimed solely towards swaying crowds, blindly stomping their way into the small hours.</p>\n<p>Sawf is one of those excellent producers whose talent is significantly under-rewarded by credit he’s given. Whilst having released on Modal Analysis and Moerbeck’s Code Is Law, the majority of his output has come through Perc Trax, of which the he can be considered something of a stalwart. ’Trivoli’ his offering to the EP plays around a jagged synth-riff looming over muscular warehouse drums. Hollow, ringing snares puncture through the thudding layer of kick drums as the track moves into it’s second half, reminiscent of AnD’s darker productions.</p>\n<p>Pushing things even further, Perc Trax head Ali Wells contributes ‘405’, which is in a word, brutal. As we have come to expect Wells brings out the darkest, most twisted traits in the Techno genre, this track calling to mind his earth-shaking performance at Corsica Studios for Plex/Colony/BLeeD at the start of the month. Wells makes little concession for dynamics here, instead pummelling the listener from start to finish with an incessant throbbing of harshly distorted kicks, rushing filter sweeps and unhinged high-end percussion.</p>\n<p>The final contribution to the EP comes in the form of Christian Wünsch’s sweltering ‘Alpha Particle’. Similarly to Reeko, Wünsch utilises clear-cut, factory style samples, blistering stabs quaking beneath a resolute dub-techno march.</p>\n<p>Alongside providing four thundering dancefloor bombs, the EP also manages to highlight a crossover between the two labels which might not be immediately obvious otherwise. With Exium, Oscar Mulero, Forward Strategy Group &amp; Manni Dee contributing to part Pt.2, its arrival will be more than welcome.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/115124084\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

The first release I ever bought of his entitled ‘Wintermusik’, was originally intended simply as a Christmas present for his close friends and family. Since the release of this back in 2009, the German born pianist has continued to work as diligently as ever, gaining critical acclaim for both his releases and live performances.</p>\n<p>His latest album, <em>Spaces,</em> can be considered as something of a sonic road diary, compiling carefully selected highlights from his live shows, recorded over a two year period.</p>\n<p>Frahm has a distinctive, contemporary take on the piano, his different playing approaches here helping to highlight the versatility of the instrument. These range from the spacious, melancholic wanderings of ‘Over There, It’s Raining’ to the wonderfully dynamic ‘Says’, featuring an ethereal synth-riff underpinning distant melodic variations, before building to a soaring finish in its closing minutes.</p>\n<p>Frahm’s use of electronic timbres is not limited to ‘Says’ however, lumbering opening track ‘An Aborted Beginning’ featuring bleepy dub-echoes and clattering percussion. The wandering, frenetic ‘Toilet Brushes’ and pensive, Múm-esque closer ‘Ross’ Harmonium’ also make use of synthetic textures, yet both retain an organic, natural quality to them despite this.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this is to be expected however, seeing as the most distinctive feature of _Spaces _is Frahm’s willingness to include certain mistakes and impromptu interruptions that give the album a sense of intimacy and character that simply couldn’t have been achieved by the clinical approach to recording live albums usually taken. ‘Improvisation For Piano, Laughs, Coughs And A Cell Phone’ for example lives up to it’s title. Throughout the album in general background noise and audience interactions are welcomed rather than pushed out, giving he listener a sense of space and setting that is really rather easy to become immersed in.</p>\n<p>Having heard friends sing the praises of Frahm’s live performances plenty of times in the past, I can’t imagine there being a much more faithful replication of his shows than the album presented here, of which having listened through, I am looking forward to attending._</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/106182877\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n",

Whilst all genres are subjected to over-saturation, House in particular seems to suffer from this, making it difficult to find time to sift through and dust off the gems. Given this, you can imagine my contentment at being shepherded towards this latest warm, sauntering release from Birdsmakingmachine, via London based label and event hosts, Half Baked.</p>\n<p>The sultry ‘King Pula’ opens the EP with propulsive, jazz-laced House grooves - off-kilter splutters of piano darting between smacking snares and shuffling hats. The detail afforded to the track is really quite impressive, subtle variations appearing consistently through its duration. Through the breakdown, samples from Jan Jelinek’s ‘Do Dekor’ from the micro-house classic, _Loop Finding Jazz Records, _slowly creep in, before the track’s seductive, dark swing is reintroduced.</p>\n<p>'Gnip Gnop' remains equally light its feet, however it loses some of 'King Pula's directness, opting for a more serene approach, utilising head-spinning stabs, echoing between a pointed low-end and gentle, swaying drums.</p>\n<p>Alongside the two originals, Japanese born Perlon affiliate Fumiya Tanaka also contributes to the EP, with a glitchy interpretation of ‘King Pula’. Low-pitched, out of focus vocals are added amongst Tanaka’s carefree recast of the track’s original elements, the drums shed of excess weight, leaving skeletal taps and clicks behind.</p>\n<p>Birdsmakingmachine have managed to find themselves a pocket of House music that hasn’t been subjected to the over-saturation mentioned in the opening paragraph, and expressed it beautifully through this EP. Simultaneously the release also makes a fitting match to its host, given the relaxed hazy afternoon vibes Half Baked provide through their events.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/14123661\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

A recent interview with <a href=\"http://www.meoko.net/interviews/4-dj-s-5-questions-vinyl-my-love\">Meoko</a> testifies his commitment to all things wax, and with a history as a vinyl-only DJ it makes sense that he should put such care into his releases; cutting each record to 180 gram vinyl, before hand-stamping each limited edition run.</p>\n<p>With the first two outings for the label selling out in healthy succession of their respective releases, ‘333’ comes as the final impression to the imprint of this year, continuing to hone Wadsworth’s rough-edged take on the House &amp; Techno crossover.</p>\n<p>Foggy kicks and stammering, low-slung percussion open ‘333’s a-side, before the introduction of a funk-tinged analogue hook, sauntering over dust covered high end percussion driving the track forward.</p>\n<p>The record’s b-side on the other hand comes in the form of a booming recast of Wadsworth’s 2011 track, ‘Lime and Pink’. Whilst the track deviates slightly from the Uranus project’s usual blueprint with its use of vocals, it otherwise fits in nicely alongside the previous releases, helped along by a fresh mixdown and master, bringing ‘Lime and Pink’ up to speed with the Uranus era Wadsworth sound.</p>\n<p>A rambling acid bassline leads the track - a deeper, more firmly cemented variant on the a-side’s comparatively furtive equivalent. Lethargic, shuffling drums and thudding four to the floor bass pulses comprise the track’s rhythm, creating a solid backdrop for the occasional burst of soulful, reverberating vocal, intertwined with sullen, jazz-tinged organ.</p>\n<p>Wadsworth has always been producer capable of working within his own sphere, without the need to rely on popular trends. The establishment of his own imprint however has arguably afforded him an even greater freedom to explore abstract ideas, and push the boundaries of his craft to greater limits.</p>\n<p>Previews of the release can be heard via Decks <a href=\"http://www.decks.de/t/kris_wadsworth-uranus_333/c26-e6\">here</a>.</p>\n",

On the surface the release offers three tracks of slamming, rough-edged warehouse techno, yet there is also a restraint and underlying appreciation for noisey, abrasive sounds that sets this release apart from your usual peak-time DJ tool.</p>\n<p>Pounding four to the floor kicks and glitchy, crumpled percussion opens ‘Mö1’ launching into foot-stomping industrial rhythms with little hesitation. Whilst the textures are suitably gritty and rough around the edges to be considered as warehouse techno, the track seems to shake free some of the frowning seriousness held by much of the genre; likely due to the fact its infectious swinging grooves are so incredibly dancefloor friendly.</p>\n<p>Continuing in this vein, ‘Mö2’ sees churning chords filter in and out of focus at a frantic pace above pummeling low-end, calling to mind Rene Pawolitz’s EQD project. A sidechained high-end synth is brought in around the midpoint, adding a sense of tension to Möd3rn’s twisting hook and breakneck drum patterns.</p>\n<p>The EP’s final offering ‘Mö3’ is perhaps the most experimental of the three, centring around a gently mutating analogue riff ebbing and flowing between vapourous percussion and a cavernous, swampy low-end. Whilst the previous two offerings are geared towards peak-time functionality, ‘Mö3’ feels more tailored towards swaying crowds in the early-hours, with its vaguely unsettling static textures and discordant synth line.</p>\n<p>Without losing anything in terms of functionality, Möd3rn have managed to craft an incredibly richly textured release through the 10/13 EP, putting themselves forwards as an act well worth keeping tabs on into 2014.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/14770712\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

With releases on many labels like Coincidence Records, Tic Tac Toe, and Random Island, she has deservedly gained the support of many of the leading figures in the techno scene, one of these being Decoy founder DJ Rebekah, with whom Miss Sunshine has come to release with most recently.</p>\n<p>There is a classic, retro-tinged feel to her productions, a factor greatly evident through the title track to her Decoy release ‘Third Act’. Echoing rave stabs pulse above a distorted four to the floor kick pattern and shuffling percussion, creating a piece of groove-laced techno more than fit for club use.</p>\n<p>Following this is ‘Intimidate’, a track which despite its title and hard hitting percussion, possesses an air of euphoria following the introduction of Miss Sunshines bright swathes of synthesiser.</p>\n<p>Retaining the same 90s indebted warehouse vibes, ‘Ground Loop’ heaves its way into darker territory. Its haunting grooves develop patiently alongside a thudding march of kick drums, leaving a good three minutes before the driving cymbals signal the track has reached its pinnacle. Generally in fact, the track is incredibly understated, making it a perfect offering for early-hours basement sessions.</p>\n<p>'Ground Loop' is also subjected to the remix treatment, Figure SPC affiliate Markus Suckut contributing a rather drastic recast. In classic Suckut style any excess weight is shed from the track, leaving a slab of stripped-back, raw mechanical techno. Suckut's interpretation calls to mind the productions of Adam X with its minimalist, alien approach to techno, eschewing any traditional take on structure opting for a more loop-driven approach with little concession for long buildups or drops.</p>\n<p>Suckut’s remix adds a healthy dose of variation to an EP with a very well refined if rather specific perspective on techno. The EP in general makes a nice addition to the style of melodic, slow-building warehouse techno Decoy has been pushing since its inception, and as ever, we will await its next move with much anticipation.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/12960095\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Comprising the fourteenth impression made to the label, the record comes backed with a pair of remixes, from former LFO member Gez Varley aka G-Man, &amp; Raum Musik affiliate D.Diggler.</p>\n<p>Spieth’s original is one of contrast; regimented claps and sturdy four to the floor rhythms are usually the province of much straighter forms of techno, here however these are juxtaposed with echoing freeform chords and driving surges of low-end. The end result is deeply atmospheric, yet due to the track’s firmly cemented rhythms it still manages to maintain a strong presence on the dancefloor.</p>\n<p>Gez Varley’s billowing take on ‘Dark Matter’ occupies the a-side of the release, sampling a small portion of the original’s chords, stuttering them above a propulsive low-end, slowly building across the track’s near eight minute duration. Varley’s remix is rather unrelenting, in stark contrast to D.Diggler’s structurally diverse take on the track.</p>\n<p>Opening with rugged, industrial tinged drums, Diggler’s remix patiently develops from claustrophobic warehouse jam to simmering dub-techno as a reconfiguration of Spieth’s original chords are gradually introduced, slowly opening the track up. Its this sort of contrast that makes tracks like this perfect for bridging different sections of mixes, Diggler’s remix in general feeling designed around its effectiveness and functionality.</p>\n<p>Having had a substantial career spanning back to the late 1990s, its perhaps little surprise Spieth manages to provide such consistently high quality releases, however the fact that this standard threshold is maintained even as the German born producer broaches new genres is really something to be admired.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/10578072\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>&quot;I had gotten to the stage of my career where I wasn’t happy and felt like wanted to shake things up a bit&quot; the artist behind the He/aT moniker offers up when asked about the relatively new project. &quot;Something that makes me cringe is when you get techno producers who change their name, make a big thing of it and tell everyone they are doing it to put out different music and its exactly the same stuff as they were making before. I decided to do it as an experiment to see if my music would hold up on its own without any social media campaigns or heavy PR or anything; organically rather than play the game which i’d been used to and is “the norm” these days. This interview is the first thing I have done actually.&quot;</p>\n<p>As an artist whose resumé includes running multiple labels, and releasing via an assortment of well reputed imprints, the decision to work facelessly for this latest project was certainly a bold one, preventing him from relying on previously established connections.</p>\n<p>&quot;I had absolutely no idea how [the releases] would go down until the (limited) DJ mailout for the first EP.&quot; he states. &quot;The best bit was seeing people who had never been into my previous stuff love it and when it dropped in the shops it sold out in a couple of days which was amazing. Hardwax called it “killer techno” on their writeup which was nice as they are obviously really picky and it gave me a lot of confidence going into the second one. The He/aT music is a lot more experimental than my previous stuff and it’s fun working outside of my comfort zone, but at the same time, It feels like a totally natural process.&quot;</p>\n<p>Whilst the establishment of the project has undoubtedly been a risky one, it appears so far to have paid off; the five-hundred copies of He/aT 001 selling out in quick succession of their release mid-way through this year.</p>\n<p>&quot;The techniques I use when making the music are different and although it’s a new approach, i’m finding it comes really easily.&quot; He/aT says of the new approach to production the project has prompted. &quot;The four tracks for the first EP were made over a solid five day period from start to finish. The second EP was a bit more drawn out. I just wanted to go all out and not fall into the usual comfortable studio ways and traps with this thing and keep it fresh and fun for me.&quot;</p>\n<p>Monday sees the release of the aforementioned second EP, blending four tracks of rough-edged, yet incredibly melodic techno. Despite the fact this is being made publicly available next week, from the sounds of things it shouldn’t be too long before we can expect to see more He/aT material dropping.</p>\n<p>&quot;I’ve got one track left to do on the third EP, and i’ve been working on an album for the fifth or sixth release.&quot; he expands on the future of the project. &quot;The plan is to stay anonymous until then if I can. It’s not easy! As for other stuff, after the first EP, I got quite a few requests from various labels about doing remixes and EP’s and I just wanted to hold off from getting back into that cycle. I had got into loop of saying yes to a lot of stuff which I wouldn’t necessarily be 100% into before and, again with this project, just wanted to go against everything I had done before. I’m not going to be as strict after this second EP and but I’ll see what happens, there are some really interesting things on the horizon. I’ve also just joined Elite for my DJ bookings / Live shows. They work with people I respect and have always been very professional and have a good team there. So i’m really excited about what’s next, but one thing I am applying to this project above anything else is patience; I don’t want to do anything unless its 100% right.&quot;</p>\n<p>You can keep up to date with the latest He/aT developments through <a href=\"https://twitter.com/heeaatt\">Twitter</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/heattrax\">Facebook</a>, or via his <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/he_at\">Soundcloud</a>.</p>\n<p>Bookings &amp; Management: chris@elitemm.co.uk</p>\n",

The consistency at which the label manages to deliver in quality whilst simultaneously bringing to light new producers however, shouldn’t be under appreciated.</p>\n<p>With the first of their various artist EPs occupying the sort of tearing industrial territory promoted by the likes of Surgeon or Karenn, you might expect its successive component to follow suit, however 006 is a significantly dubbier, more pensive offering than its counterpart.</p>\n<p>Japanese born Yuji Kondo opens the release with the stumbling ‘Tilt’, organic percussion swimming over vapourous atmospheres and a lagging, tripped out melody.</p>\n<p>Dicicco takes a deeper, dub-tinged perspective with ‘Roksan’, harking back to his early productions such as ‘Night Erosion’ or ‘Material Things’, here adding a gorgeously finessed layered sound-design. Ringing beeps maintain a steady rhythm between Dicicco’s warbling melodies and clattering percussion, glitchy, broken rhythms adding mesmeric sway.</p>\n<p>As expected, D Carbone’s ‘Asynthetic’ manoeuvres into harder warehouse territory. His discordant riff and wailing atmospherics wouldn’t be out of place soundtracking a b-movie Horror film, underpinned by crumbling percussion and thundering four to the floor kicks.</p>\n<p>The EP’s closing offering comes from Barcelona based duo NX1. The track entitled ‘IS1’, providing a more tempered alternative approach to warehouse techno than D Carbone’s tear-out prior offering. A mist of dense static textures build gradually, interplaying between shuddering blasts of low-end and apocalyptic drones.</p>\n<p>Whilst delving equally deep into the realms of experimentalism as the EP prior, the 006 manages to offer up a restrained, introspective alternative, crafting narrative across the works of four artists that typically might not be bracketed together.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/114570566\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

In Piotr’s own words, this new project is a “low key experiment between friends”. This EP has left me scratching my head in bewilderment trying to work out exactly what to make of it, and yet I remain completely captivated by every bizarre move they make.</p>\n<p>Shifting between dub rhythms, vocals snippets, piercing glitch noises and organic percussion, this EP is something of a sonic rollercoaster. From the moody subs of ‘Edgeridge’, to the jittery and uncomfortable angular beats of ‘Shorting’, the duo has a truly explorative vision in mind. There’s even some incredibly intimate and personal post-rock style singing on ‘Widower’, possibly the bravest on the EP. A personal highlight is ‘Choila’, which twists and contorts around steady percussive samples, and wouldn’t sound out of place on the latest album from The Knife.  With such a myriad of influences, it’s hard to keep track of all that is going on; just as soon as you feel you’ve got it down, Piotr &amp; Heslin make damn well sure that you don’t, pulling the rug from under your feet and leaving you as mystified as when you started.</p>\n<p>However, that’s not to say this EP sounds disjointed or unfocused, to the contrary, there are strong themes that run throughout. In particular, there is an emphasis on creating vivid dream-like scenes that appear only momentarily before receding away. Within seconds, the listener is dropped in the middle of a new unique world, and before you have time to make sense of it, you’re already through to the next one.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in hearing some music infused with the true spirit of experimentation, there’s no excuse not to check out the work of each of these artists. If you would like to check out more, you can hear a mix (<a href=\"http://www.straylandings.co.uk/post/66715091109/0023-derek-piotr\">here</a>) that Derek Piotr graced us with earlier in the year, littered with oddball trinkets from all over the world.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/120980515\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

As things develop, a warbling riff eases its way into the mix, adding an eerie, unsettling quality to the track.</p>\n<p>It’s no secret that in recent years the pair have been pursuing darker more abrasive sounds, however ‘Bow#2’ borders on the antisocial; the EP’s opener sounding light in comparison. Haggard, broken rhythms work into a stoney-faced march, piercing modular synth work creeping through the grating layers of noise as the track builds into its second half.</p>\n<p>Russell Haswell’s decomposition of ‘Bow#1’ occupies the second half of the record’s b-side, calling to mind Mathew Herbert’s work as Radio Boy through its rasping hardware style aesthetics, and wild improvisational quality. Haswell strips the track of it’s flailing melody, warping the percussive elements out of recognition. Steam engine like noise blasts through alien bleeps and burbles, building to near unbearable intensity in the track’s closing minutes.</p>\n<p>Modal Analysis’ two original tracks to one remix formula has always been carried off a damn sight more successfully than the same recipe is with other labels, largely for the fact their choice of remixers always seem beautifully appropriate. Here the pairing effectively puts AnD in the context of noise music in its wider sphere, of which they fit into extremely well in my opinion.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/117597959\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

The label was established not so long ago by Sleaze co-founder Lex Gorrie, occupying itself with deeply textured styles of big room techno.</p>\n<p>Here East London favourite Dax J joins the likes of Submerge, Ricardo Garduno, Mattias Friedel and The Plant Worker on the label by providing three potently fast tempo original tracks, in addition to a remix by the incredibly creative Jeff Derringer, the man behind Chicago’s underground ‘Oktave’ parties.</p>\n<p>Opening with warehouse-orientated title track ‘Delusions of Morality’, the EP kicks off at full-throttle, a panic-inducing riff predatorily circling thudding kicks and churning percussion. Dax manages to maintain plenty of variation through the track, peripheral atmospheres and percussive variations creeping in and out of the mix.</p>\n<p>Second track ‘Scowl’ offers a welcome break in pace, swaying towards a deeper, multi-layered approach. The track is undeniably progressive, chiming stabs ring out between efficient, almost footwork style percussion and rumbling low-end.</p>\n<p>The claustrophobic ‘Spotlights’ comprises Dax J’s final original track on the EP, and is also the subject of Jeff Derringer’s remix. Whilst the original brings hissing, paranoid textures to the fore above a pounding for to the floor march, Derringer alleviates the track’s tension, crafting something considerable as dub-techno. Swathes of melancholic ambience build across its near eight minute duration, shuffling percussion gently underpinning gradually developing atmospherics and ethereal synth-work.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/116782327&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Growing up on a diet of early Jungle &amp; Drum &amp; Bass, East London residing producer and DJ Dax J has been making a serious impression on the UK techno scene over the last few years, having released with labels such as Sleaze, Deeply Rooted &amp; Affin, not to mention his own label, EarToGround. Co-founded in 2010, the multi-faceted project has released works from the likes of Secluded, Markus Suckut &amp; Truncate, alongside providing interviews, events and podcasts.</p>\n<p>Following our review of his Unknown Territory release earlier in the week, we decided to catch up with Dax to discuss the record, his formative years listening to Kool FM, and the future plans for EarToGround, as well as his recently founded solo-run imprint Monnom Black.</p>\n<p><strong>This has been a massive year for you, with big releases on Weekend Circuit, EarToGround, Deeply Rooted, Monnom Black, and now Unknown Territory. Could you tell us a little about how a typical day in the studio goes for you and how you approach the music making process?</strong></p>\n<p>Well I generally try to gauge some kind of idea of what I want to do first off. This is important for me so that I can have some direction and efficiency in where I want to go with the track I’m making. I find that when I don’t have a specific aim for a track I tend to use up a lot of time creating random sounds for inspiration to get things going and this sometimes slows me down.</p>\n<p>So I’ll usually start by switching on the Hardware Machines and just jamming with sounds on my synths, drum machines and outboard effects. I’ll create a few sounds and bounce them out to use as samples too as well as running some machines in direct through MIDI into Logic. Once I’ve got a good palette of sounds to work from I’ll start building the main body of the track and once that is done I’ll make an arrangement out of it.  Once the main work is done I’ll leave it for a week or two and go back in with fresh ears and finish it off. I always like to have a few unfinished projects on the go, for me it keeps things interesting, if I start getting bored or stuck on a particular track, I’ll just switch things over, I find it helps with productivity levels and I’m more creative this way.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little about your past and present influences, and how you got into techno?</strong></p>\n<p>I get a lot of influences from my past, I come from a Jungle, Drum &amp; Bass background so sometimes you may hear some of that influence come through in my productions. I love all the old breaks and the classic amen sound, that will never leave me, it’s engrained. When I was at school there was a little crew of us, we’d always be listening to old Jungle tapes on our Walkmans at break times, Hype ‘95 at Helter Skelter or it would be Kool FM tapes recorded off the radio.</p>\n<p>I was about fifteen when I started DJing, buying records from Blackmarket Records in Soho every week and playing on pirate radio. I had a radio show on Origin FM for four years and started releasing music on Mickey Finns’ label, Urban Takeover as well as my own imprint I started back then. Going forward a few years later I went on to study Music Technology at Uni, I was still into the Drum &amp; Bass and It was all good for a while but slowly I started to fall out of love with the scene, the wrong people were going to the raves and the music started to get very jump up too, it was loosing its darker raw edge.</p>\n<p>The year that I finished my degree at Uni, I decided I would celebrate by spending the whole summer in Ibiza. I had never been there before or knew anything about it or the music. It seemed like a good idea, I had heard alot about the place, I didn’t know what to expect but I wanted to experience it and see what all the fuss was about. As soon as I made it over there I was instantly blown away by the music and the spectacle of the clubs. I was drawn towards the techno I was hearing, and more so than the other music styles that were out there, I kept thinking, this music is like Drum &amp; Bass but slower, I love it! I felt reborn again into this new music I had discovered and I was hooked. At the end of the summer I got home and immediately got back in the studio and started making this new sound, techno!</p>\n<p><strong>How did the EarToGround label get started?</strong></p>\n<p>So I had been chatting to Chris about making some music together a few years ago. We lived quite close to each other and were both into our techno so it just seemed natural to get together. My studio was at home at the time and he came round one night and brought some sounds over for us to get started with. By the end of that night we had the skeleton of the track down for “Programm”, which went on to be the first release on ETG.</p>\n<p>After a few more sessions spent on it we had the track finished and wanted to test it out. Gareth had an EarToGround party on that weekend at a little venue in East London called East Village. I went down there with Chris before the party started to give the track we made a test play on the sound system. It sounded great. Gareth was there listening and he liked it too. It was there on the spot that he said why don’t we start an EarToGround label and release it. We all agreed it sounded like a cool project and that we would try it out, and from there the label was born.</p>\n<p><strong>You’ve also started your own label Monnom Black not long ago - how is that fitting in to your already busy schedule? Have you got any hints for us as to what’s going to be coming next on MB in 2014?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes Monnom Black is going well, I’m happy with how it’s all panned out so far, we just released the second vinyl which is an EP by Kaelan, a great producer from Italy, I really love his sound. I’m also a big fan of NX1 and they provided the remix. Next year there will be more material from myself and the artists who have already been involved on the label as well as some new music from a couple of great producers. Also we started the label podcast that will see mixes from artists associated with the label come out throughout the rest of next year.</p>\n<p><strong>Would you say that your productions reflect the styles that you like to play out? Or do you think of them as separate things?</strong></p>\n<p>Most of the tracks I make are directed mainly for the dancefloor so I do tend to play out a lot of my productions in my DJ sets. I do make soundscapes and experimental stuff but I’ve never commercially released any of them. I don’t get a chance to play those ones out as generally I feel you need to be playing a specific time, venue and crowd for those ones to really work on the floor, but I’m sure the right time will come for me to play that other sound, and maybe I will get to release a few on the future album when that time happens.</p>\n<p><strong>What city are you really itching to play?</strong></p>\n<p>I’ve loved playing in all the cities that I have in the past as each have had their own unique identity and vibe whether it has been one of the major capitals or a smaller city, so to pick out one particular place is hard to do, but if I had to choose one I’d like to play in, I would probably choose Tokyo, I am yet to play in Asia and would love to experience Japan, I’ve heard that the clubs are amazing and I love the culture and the food. So Tokyo is definitely a place that is up there high on my list.</p>\n<p><strong>Have you got any words to say about your release on Unknown Territory?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m very happy to have made the EP and be apart of Unknown Territory. When Lex and Hans spoke to me about the project I was excited to do be involved and it tied in together nicely with the Sleaze release I made at the start of the year. I really like the deeper remix from Jeff Derringer too, it gave the original track a whole new dimension. So overall I’m very pleased with it all, expect a lot more to come from the label.</p>\n<p><strong>We would also really like if you could provide us with a top 10 chart for December (just tracks that really spoke to you). Do you think you could do that for us?</strong></p>\n<ol><li>Rod // Hux [Klockworks]</li>\n<li>Outline // Encounter [Blueprint]</li>\n<li>Dax J // The Grind [EarToGround]</li>\n<li>Roberto // Rings Of Smoke (Mike Dehnert Remix) [Fachwerk]</li>\n<li>JC // Endurance [Deeply Rooted]</li>\n<li>Dax J // Scowl [Unknown Territory]</li>\n<li>Phillipe Petite // Venus [EarToGround]</li>\n<li>Sleep Archive // A Man Dies in the Street Pt.2 [Tresor]</li>\n<li>Jonas Kopp // You Are Mine [ARTS]</li>\n<li>AnD // Ard Core Krew [Ann Almee]</li>\n</ol>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/119126765&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Whilst the LP is largely dancefloor-functional, this is in the most dynamic possible sense, bringing abrasive drones and apocalyptic textures further into the foreground than ever.</p>\n<p>It is easy to see why Shifted is often mentioned in the same breath as Downwards affiliates such as Samuel Kerridge; this record sharing more than a few crossovers with Kerridge’s own album release for this year, <em>A Fallen Empire</em>. Most notably perhaps are the similarities in grinding, bass drones and deadpan, hollow atmospherics. Opening track ‘Core In Stone’ makes a fine example of this - metallic textures swirling in the periphery whilst menacing low-end slowly gathers intensity.</p>\n<p>Unexpectedly, the style of production Shifted has brought to labels like Mote-Evolver also find their place on the LP. The disorientating ‘Suspended Inside’ for example fitting in neatly alongside the other abstract, early-hour offerings with its heavily filtered chimes and vapourous percussion.</p>\n<p>Of these, radioactive bubble-bath ‘Pulse Incomplete’ is especially unconventional, bounding kick drums rollicking along beneath pulses of static and piercingly sharp hi-end percussion. Subsequent track ‘Contract O’ follows a similar trajectory, swollen low-end rumbling beneath alien bleeps and squelches, all the while driven forward by the insistent slicing of hi-hats, carried off with military precision.</p>\n<p>In the past it has often been said that techno is a genre plagued by inadequacy and shortcomings when it comes to producing in the album format. However, with the release of <em>Under A Single</em> <em>Banner</em>, alongside Samuel Kerridge’s aforementioned LP and standouts from Exium, Reeko &amp; Zeitgeiber this year just to name a few, I can’t help feeling this perception being in need of serious challenge. For Shifted’s part, <em>Under A Single Banner</em> gives us an insight into an aspect of the Berlin based producer’s sound strongly hinted at in the past, but up until now, never revealed quite as extensively as this record so successfully does.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/121134630&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

With fellow Londoner Bob Bhamra aka West Norwood Cassette Library delivering on this front himself for a number of years, it seemed only a matter of time before the two forces joined together as they do here, with the release of the double-vinyl pack, ‘8-Track Cartridge’.</p>\n<p>Whilst the release might be considered House within general parameters, the genre’s lineage of Funk, Soul &amp; Disco has a definite stamp on the record, combined with Bhamra’s nifty use of drum breaks. This ranges from the downtempo funk of ‘Bodyrock’, to the electro-tinged ‘Roots’ - a track calling to mind Manix’s offerings to the early UK Hardcore scene, with its use of thunderous double-speed drum loops.</p>\n<p>There is a raw quality to the double EP, but in a way that feels natural, and as a bi-product of the Bhamra’s sound, rather than created in the faux-hardware style currently popular. Take the frantic, squelching ‘Bubble’ for example, a buoyant acid riff fizzles between roughly chopped breaks and rolling toms, with the occasional James Brown vocal outcry interspersed.</p>\n<p>The aforementioned ‘rawness’ of the release may come from the fact it also has a live feel to it, opening track ‘Acid Jazz’ making a good example of this with its choppy drums and disjointed funk guitar. Following track ‘We Have To Live In The Future’ is equally dynamic, it’s nosediving bass-riff driving forward filtered vocals and shuffling drums.</p>\n<p>These days House music is rarely this energetic, diverse, or willing to inject a sense of humour into proceedings - Bhamra’s 8-Track Cartridge managing not to take itself too seriously, without doing so at the expense of the release’s quality. It also manages to meld an assortment of different influences in a seamlessly natural fashion, providing a welcome reminder of House’s many musical crossovers.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/121274920&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Here at SL it was the second of these releases that really caught our attention, not least because of its unexpected nature (which is paradoxically something we’ve come to expect from the producer).</p>\n<p>From early on in the South Londoner’s career, his intricate, delicate approach to percussion gave him an instantly recognisable sound, which hasn’t suffered from a shift to slower tempos. ‘Punters Step Out’ and ‘Club Scared’ adds to the canon of surprising releases, offering us two tracks that sound as if they’ve been pulled from completely different records.</p>\n<p>A-side ‘Punters Step Out’ launches in swinging drunken punches, at first sounding like the theme from <em>Chucky Returns</em> with it’s wavering, detuned Hammond chords. Behind it is a fairly inoffensive beat swaying in an out of the mix; at times drowned in layers of dense reverb, at others brought sharply into focus. As the track progresses, its wavering melody and erratic percussion seem to get a grip of themselves for a minute or two, only to descend once again into the disorientating mess the track opened with in its closing minutes.</p>\n<p>B-side ‘Club Scared’ offers no confusion as to its nature; an unrelentingly percussive onslaugh launches in right from the offset, calling to mind the sort of frenetic twisted drums used by Randomer. It can be considered perhaps the more “club friendly” side of the record, although admittedly hearing “this is a trick’ and “you have heard this before” might not be what you’d consider ‘friendly’ at four in the morning. Joe’s panic-inducing vocals are vaguely reminiscent of those used through Funkineven’s retro-styled “Roland’s Jam”, jumping out between jagged, tension-fraught rhythms.</p>\n<p>In a recent interview exchange with Call Super, Joe mentioned how he has recently committed to taking music seriously as a full-time pursuit. If I had been to second guess this I’d probably argue it’d be likely this would lead to a rationalisation, and watering down of his sound so as not to jeopardise any pre-established credibility. In fact what Joe has done with this record is quite the opposite, showing he is still just as happy to challenge perceptions as to what dancefloor music “should be” as ever.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/16369303&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

The label’s latest venture comes in the form of a mix series entitled ‘Unknown Landscapes’, the first of which covering over an hour of unreleased material from a range of Pole Group affiliates. With Mulero having offered up the first of these CDs himself recently, Pole Group have seen fit to issue a subsequent 12”, with four of the mix’s standout tracks from DVS1, Reeko, Kwartz &amp; Adam X selected to make the cut.</p>\n<p>In spite of his sporadic release history, an incredibly high standard has come to be expected from Minneapolis based DVS1 - the productions he does put out conforming to the stringent threshold he also applies to his DJing. ‘Strobe’, his offering to the debut Unknown Landscapes 12” is no different; pulsating low-end and unnerving, mechanical percussion are carried off with clinical precision between trickling hi-hats &amp; filtered atmospherics.</p>\n<p>Kwartz follows a similar tact through his offering ‘Hate’, the Madrid based producer venturing deeper still however. Hammering bass drums shudder beneath stuttering percussion, void of tonal elements for a good two minutes of the track. When melodic components eventually do enter, it happens subtly - faintly discordant atmospheres build before cutting to piercing beeps, returning the track to a deadpan, nightmare march.</p>\n<p>Manoeuvring proceedings slightly away from the highly functional approach employed by DVS1 &amp; Kwartz, Reeko places central focus on slowly migrating atmospheres through ‘Enlightenment Process’, conjuring up images of fog-covered alien landscapes.</p>\n<p>Closing the EP is Adam X’s ‘Meridien Arc’, a track which stands furthest apart from the records other offerings. The biggest difference comes from the fact the Berlin based producer eschews the usual four the floor stomp opting for a more dynamic kick pattern, causing a ripple effect upwards to the tracks other elements. Abrasive, heaving low-end is further distorted by warped industrial textures, working towards a shuddering close in the track’s final minutes.</p>\n<p>Previews of the record can be heard via Triple Vision, <a href=\"http://www.triplevision.nl/release/POLEGROUP021/\">here</a>.</p>\n",

Moniri, aka Kaeba. Whilst 2013 has been an undoubtably important year for Plaster with releases on Stroboscopic Artefacts, Kvitnu &amp; SonuoS, Moniri has also found the time to offer up a fresh Kaeba release in the form of ‘Mirrorless’, a self-released four track EP, including a remix from fellow Italians Retina.it.</p>\n<p>Opening the EP is the glitched out, cinematic, ‘Ektachrome’. The track develops painstakingly - taking a good two minutes to gear up to faltering melodies, processed in such a way as to make them sound like a card deck being hastily shuffled. Echoing bass tones give the track a dub-tinged feel, also adding additional rhythm to the track. With this and Moniri’s rapidly filtered chords, there is little need for complex drums - a skeletal kick snare pattern sufficing.</p>\n<p>Following this is title track ‘Mirrorless’, centering around barbed percussion and rushing, trance-like melodies. These are kept from falling into cliché by Moniri’s excellently crafted, raw textural elements and swirling atmospheres. The combination of emotive melodic elements and razor sharp sound-design is carried off with a precision and mathematical exactement reminiscent of Raster Noton artist’s like Kangding Ray or Byetone.</p>\n<p>'Stereopticon' follows a similar theme although the track feels less reverberating and more present - crisp clicks and snaps biting through Moniri's expressive synth-work. Retina.it's interpretation is pulverising and mechanical, steam pistons firing off in all directions between course glitches, and a rugged four to the floor pulse. The tonal elements of the Kaeba original are almost entirely suppressed, making a brief, dampened appearance in the track's closing minutes before cutting sharply back to Retina.it's churning, factory workout.</p>\n<p>Alongside the output of the Plaster project, ‘Mirrorless’ proves Moniri has a plenty to feel satisfied with this year, and with the ice well and truly broken, lets hope 2014 brings similarly well executed releases as this.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/120856347&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

The track is more driving than you would expect to hear from Tin Man alone - the influence of Cassegrain’s rhythmic energy is notably present, guiding the listener on a deep, spacey musical journey.</p>\n<p>Following this is ‘Sex Kit’ a track which snaps the listener out of the dreamlike world woven by ‘High &amp; Low’. The track is strongly reminiscent of the old school acid-techno sound that once dominated the UK rave scene in the 90’s albeit at a slightly slower tempo.</p>\n<p>Closing track ‘Sand Maze’ is perhaps where we notice the fusion of Tin Man’s analogue acid synths with Cassegrain’s raw industrial percussion most strongly. Halfway through the track it’s leading 303 riff subsides slightly, allowing for a more delicate musical motif to enter, slowly becoming drenched in reverb, before coming to a giddy, grinding halt.</p>\n<p>This isn’t the first time these two artists have collaborated together, and hopefully ‘High &amp; Low’ won’t be the last, given how well their blend of styles complement one another on this latest record.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/116990689&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>You’d be hard pressed to find a way of discussing the current techno scene in the UK without mentioning Manchester based Andrew Bowen &amp; Dimitri Poumplidis, known as simply AnD. With their formative releases having appeared on labels such as Mindset &amp; Idle Hands, the pair cemented themselves in the techno community with dub-tinged 12”s for Horizontal Ground, Krill Music, and perhaps most importantly Inner Surface Music - a label co-founded by the pair with close friend, Tom Dicicco.</p>\n<p>Since its inception in 2011, the vinyl-only imprint has manoeuvred from strength to strength, charting the journey into harder, more aggressive techno with which AnD themselves have taken in recent years.</p>\n<p>With the sixth offering to Inner Surface Music having been released recently, we caught up with the pair to discuss the label, their recent Modal Analysis 12” and the significance of Eastern Bloc Records.</p>\n<p><strong>So first off how how are things? We recently saw the release of your ‘Bow’ EP for Modal Analysis, how long had this been in the works for?</strong></p>\n<p>We are very good thankyou, it’s been an extremely busy year for us! We have had a release lined up with Modal Analysis since the label was forming as an idea. We originally played for them at their club night in Athens in 2011 and we were instantly made to feel at home with their family of friends. It was so nice to meet a bunch of like minded souls and we all really made a connection from the start. So it made total sense for us to get involved with the label.</p>\n<p><strong>Over the years your productions have changed a fair bit – the early releases have even been described with the context of Dubstep, whilst recently things have got harder and more distorted. How do you think you’ve informed each others listening tastes over the years?</strong></p>\n<p>Over the years we have definitely had a profound effect on each others listening tastes. We both listen to a lot of different music from one another, if we both have an ipod on us and you looked through them both, they will most likely be the bi-polar of each other. There will most likely not be one track on there that is the same. We think this works well for us though, we tend to be inspired by different sounds that end up coming back out in ideas as something completely different but still coherent.</p>\n<p><strong>Andro, I believe I am right in saying you used to work at Eastern Bloc Records which is how you both met Tom Dicicco. Can you tell us a little bit about your relationship with the store and its significance?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes you are right, I worked at Eastern Bloc Records in Manchester for the last six years. Eastern Bloc means alot to me! It is an Institution in Manchester, the shop is now nearly thirty years old and still going strong. The ethos of the shop has always been quality over quantity and thats why it still exists after twenty nine years. People know that when they go to buy records in the shop they will get an honest opinion and truly great selection to choose from. It was a great time in my life to work there and I feel truly honoured, especially when you look at the history of what the shop has done, and the amazing musicians and DJs that have worked there.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the music writing process like for you? Do you always write together or do you work on ideas separately and bring them to one another at a later stage?</strong></p>\n<p>We do a lot of writing together and also by ourselves, there is no real specific process to it. Inspiration comes and goes so when your in the mood it’s best to get the idea down. We both have very clear ideas of how we like our tracks to sound, so even if we do work separately it tends to end up in a similar place.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s your studio setup like as well? I heard you modify bits of hardware to use in your productions. A previous interview I read mentioned an ‘abandoned air raid shelter beneath the streets of Manchester’, although I assumed this was to be taken with a pinch of salt!</strong></p>\n<p>Haha no we definitely don’t have a studio in an air raid shelter, but if you know of one, let us know! Our studio setup is pretty small, we have recently been getting a bit more involved in buying some new hardware and outboard gear. I think we’ve been working on the computer for while, so we are both starting to feel the itch to get more hands on. We have modified a few bits and pieces of gear but it is something we rarely get the chance to do.</p>\n<p><strong>You’ve recently released the second various artist EP through ISM, can you tell us a little bit about how the release came together and your future plans for the label in general?</strong></p>\n<p>We had been speaking with Tom about the direction the label was going, and once we got to the the forth release we felt it best to make a few changes. We felt a change of aesthetic and sound was happening with where we wanted to go as a label. So we got in contact with a bunch of new artists we all loved and asked them for some music, this is how the two various artists EPs came about.</p>\n<p>To introduce that many artists to the label in the format that we had been working in would of taken six releases! We are really happy with how the last two releases have made a real statement of intent and it shows the direction we would like to go in the future. We have some very special releases planned for next year from some truly amazing artists, so watch this space!</p>\n<p><strong>You played Berghain on Friday night, how was it? I’ve read the club had quite a big affect on your sound after the first time you played there.</strong></p>\n<p>Berghain gig with Godflesh was amazing, there is just something truly inspiring about that space. Everyone on the lineup really went for it, it was a proper sound clash of different styles that worked very well together. After the first time that we played there, the club and sound system definitely had a big affect on how we wrote our tracks. The sound system is just out of this world, you can play tracks in there and it feels like your hearing them for the first time. It just brings out all these harmonics you have never heard before!</p>\n<p><strong>You DJ vinyl-only. Can you remember what the first record you each bought was and why?</strong></p>\n<p>Mmm, thats quite a hard one! We’ve been buying records for a long time now, two of the first real dance records that we bought were ‘Aphex Twin - Selected Ambient Works 85-92’ and ‘LFO - Frequencies’. These two records and a lot of the early Warp Records releases opened up our minds to something truly inspiring that we had never heard before. They were futuristic then and they are still futuristic now, true pioneers of electronic music.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally what can we expect to hear next from AnD? Any big plans for 2014?</strong></p>\n<p>Next up we have a release in January on Speedy J’s label, Electric Deluxe that we are very proud about. There is a really good selection of tracks on the EP that showcase our sound across a spectrum of tempos. We will be looking to drop AnD003, we have an EP forthcoming on an experimental label Horo and a lot more.</p>\n<p><strong>It would be great if you could give us a chart that sums up 2013 for you, Anywhere between 5 - 10 tracks would be excellent.</strong></p>\n<p>This is a hard one, way too many good releases this year! This is a very small portion of what we’ve been digging this year singles and album wise.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fret // Untitled [Downwards]</li>\n<li>Blacknecks // 001 [Blacknecks]</li>\n<li>Violetshaped // Violetshaped [Violet Poison]</li>\n<li>Metasplice // Infratracts [Morphine]</li>\n<li>Pete Swanson // Punk Authority [Software Records]</li>\n<li>Outline // Encounter [Blueprint]</li>\n<li>Various // The Black Ideal [Unknown Precept]</li>\n<li>Container // Treatment [Morphine]</li>\n<li>Sleeparchive // A Man Dies On The Streets [Tresor]</li>\n<li>Alexander Lewis // A Luminous Veil [Blackest Ever Black]</li>\n</ol>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/115292129&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

To the contrary however, the Italian born artist has managed to keep pace with the disorientating ‘201 Phasing’, released via Chris Liebing’s CLR imprint. Alongside the Lucy original, Leibing himself also delivers a claustrophobic ‘Triple Bell’ edit of the track, following a remix from Stroboscopic Artefacts mainstays, Dadub.</p>\n<p>Mortellaro’s original hangs in a constant state of flux, never quite feeling settled. Distant arpeggios orbit shuddering kick drums, layers of dampened static doused on top. Despite the use of grainy, distorted textures, ‘201 Phasing’ feels decidedly polished - abrasive, filtered drones are kept tastefully restrained. Mortellaro’s faintly disquieting riff holds an ominous, phantom like presence throughout the track’s ten minute duration, an element brought into sharper focus through Dadub’s successive interpretation.</p>\n<p>The Italian duo also capitalise on the original’s pounding drums - snarling mid-range textures are here unrestrained, creating frantic rhythms pulsing between a blur of tension fraught melodies and driving kicks.</p>\n<p>The final remix from label head Chris Liebing puts the track in the context of a more classic brand of warehouse techno, maintaining a feeling of heightened suspense across its length. Liebing steadies the ‘201 Phasing’s original rhythms, cutting the kick pattern back to a steady, hypnotic four to the floor pulse, as clamourous hats slowly shuffle away in the track’s periphery.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/125626931&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

This time round Perc Trax act as host, housing four twisting, warehouse indebted techno stompers. Here Pole Group label head Oscar Mulero acts as representative of the Spanish label alongside duo Exium, with Forward Strategy Group and Manni Dee occupying Perc Trax’s corner of the ring.</p>\n<p>'Blackstar' opens with Mulero's instantly recognisable signature. Driving loops and subtle, off-kilter melodies pulse beneath rising waves of static and stuttered hats. The track feels purpose built for extended sets - its gristled, slow-burning progression and minimalist aesthetic calling to mind early-hours basement sessions.</p>\n<p>Exium provide following track ‘Raw Visions’, living up to its name with similar mannerisms to Mulero’s opener. The Spanish outfit’s offering verges more towards the dub end of the techno spectrum however, claustrophobic atmospheres clouding over ominous, earthquaking low-end.</p>\n<p>Forward Strategy Group’s ‘Rundoled’ provides the most affront of the four offerings, grating blasts of mechanical noise acting as the track’s hook. This brazenly throbs through the track’s duration, pushing ticking high-end percussion and a plodding bass-riff into the sidelines.</p>\n<p>Closing the EP is Manni Dee’s ‘Serenity’, a track far from the state of calm its title implies. Muffled, horror-movie style outcries swell in the background, whilst militant percussion shudders relentlessly between vapourous drones and a warped bassline, reminiscent of a car’s engine revving in the distance.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/16887862&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>If you’ve taken an interest in electronic music over the past year, you probably don’t need telling that a lot of people liked Paul Woolford’s ‘Untitled’, or that Oneohtrix Point Never’s <em>R Plus Seven</em> was in fact incontestably and objectively the fourth best record released over the past twelve months. Rather than try and offer a comprehensive list of releases, artists, liveshows, labels, or whatever else; below you can find instead simply an anything goes collection of things that defined the year for each of us individually (and often collectively). There’s plenty of the same stuff you’ll find in other end-of-year features, but without the pretension of being able to produce an abstract ordered and classfied edition of the past year in electronic music (and yes, we do compile a monthly top-ten - let the hypocrisy flow).</p>\n<p>The urge to create a definitive list of the year’s ‘best’ music, even if explicitly not laying claim to objectivity, still exemplifies the hubristic urge to tame and classify the social phenomena around us, and to give it coherence by imposing a narrative on it. So instead we’re embracing the chaos and confusion that was our musical experiences last year.</p>\n<p>The following collection is not something we’ve spent too much time thinking about - just the things that immediately come to mind as what made 2013 so special and memorable. If we thought about it for much longer we’d doubtless include more of the things we ‘ought’ to include, but as it stands it’s incomplete, incoherent, open-ended; and hopefully by dint of all those things, quite interesting, just like 2013 was.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2890/11549252154_8dc3ac18ce_z.jpg\" alt=\"Atonal\"></p>\n<p>##Atonal Festival Regenerates##</p>\n<p>Hosted in the cavernous Kraftwerk Power Plant, July saw the rekindling of Atonal - a festival having run previously between 1982-1990, before its founder Dimitri Hegemann discontinued the event to found the now legendary Tresor nightclub. The re-instigation of the festival provides a welcome alternative to the usual, ‘shit-soundsystem-in-a-field’ style festival affair, providing a truly immersive experience through its carefully thought out setting.</p>\n<p>The aura of Mitte’s ‘Kraftwerk’ venue is potent enough regardless of its use as a music venue, so it isn’t hard to imagine the powerful atmosphere created with the addition of Vladislav Delay’s rhythm-imbued ambience, or Samuel Kerridge’s grinding, post-apocalyptic drones. An effort was also made to present Atonal as an arts festival at large, early afternoons hosting film screenings in the Power Plant’s now redundant control room, with various visual art installations displayed in Kraftwerk’s lower chambers.</p>\n<p>The rejuvenation of a bygone festival might suggest some attempt to relive or recreate the old days, yet Atonal 2013 felt perfectly adjusted to the current electronic, industrial and noise scenes, hosting a range of established artists alongside a healthy selection of up and comers.</p>\n<p>Theo Darton-Moore.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7418/11549251974_e6629b7dc8_z.jpg\" alt=\"Yu\"></p>\n<p>##Discovering Yu Miyashita / Yaporigami##</p>\n<p>2013 was a good year to discover the music of Yu Miyashita / Yaporigami. Having been sufficiently blown away by his Soundcloud submissions and his soundtrack to Lucio Arese’s short “Mimic” (which was screened at the Cannes Lions Festival earlier this year), we arranged to chat with him about his music and where he draws his inspiration. Along with the interview, we got an astonishing 10-track mix, masterfully constructed and enormous in its creative scope. Since then I’ve found myself returning to his music again and again.</p>\n<p>George McVicar.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2881/11551646755_4e79e630eb_z.jpg\" alt=\"SP\"></p>\n<p>##Standard Place at The Cock Tavern##</p>\n<p>This year I spent a night in a basement pub with a DIY DJ booth, Function One and a pint in a real pint glass. This was the second Standard Place night I had been to and after being treated to Ben UFO and Bok Bok last time, I trusted the crew when they said very special guests… they did not disappoint.</p>\n<p>As a warm up we were treated to Jon Rust and Reecha casually going back to back until the room was full enough to bring on the first guest. Ossie was first on and being aware of him yet not that familiar I was excited to see what he would bring. A strong house set followed with bouncy piano rifts, a storm of hi-hats and 4x4 kicks impossible not to move to.</p>\n<p>If this was to set the tone for the night we were mistaken, as Jam City stepped up and without pre-tense began an unremitting mix of garage, grime and dubstep mixed with such ferocity the crowd screamed for the drops and crowded the booth giving the whole room an atmosphere far removed from the segregation of crowd and talent most clubs endorse.</p>\n<p>To finish up my night I watched Brackles start the sing-alongs with disco classics turning the room into a strange imitation of a wedding reception (but in the best way possible). For me a one of the best nights out all year, the Standard Place guys know how to throw a party, I couldn’t stop smiling all night and it was one of those dance floors that truly unites people in sound… not to sound too cheesy.</p>\n<p>Owen Lewis.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5481/11549365823_de6889b6fe_z.jpg\" alt=\"WR2\"></p>\n<p>##Well Rounded Vinyl Vendors##</p>\n<p>Many of us were sad to hear that Well Rounded would be drawing a line under the label side of their project earlier this year, however, every cloud has a silver lining. Strictly speaking, Well Rounded Vinyl Vendors opened their doors at the tail-end of 2012, but it was 2013 that’s cemented their reputation in and around Brighton.</p>\n<p>The impact internet trading has had on record stores around the UK is common knowledge, yet with a stock tightly curated enough that frontman Ash Marlowe can assure a passion and insight into every single record in the place, it seems hard to fathom how anyone could think a digital medium could deliver anything like the same experience.</p>\n<p>I’ve often found myself lamenting the fact that Brighton doesn’t seem to have a such an identifiable, cohesive scene as a city like Bristol, Manchester or Sheffield, yet it is creative institutions like this one that help to move things in this right direction.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5517/11549357545_fd5c1d63cc_z.jpg\" alt=\"bandshell_590x353_tmpl\"></p>\n<p>##Bandshell - Caustic View##\nI feel almost embarrassed that I never got round to reviewing this when it came out. Bandshell’s second EP not only solidified his sound – one that is truly distinctive, (quite a feat after only two releases!), but also cemented his place among my favourite newcomers of the last few years. The opening track, ‘Winton’, is ridiculously infectious, inventively swerving around compressed noise and sub-pulses with unapologetic power. ‘Perc’ takes a more considered approach, delicately interweaving moody analogue lines on top of one another, akin to (dare I say it?) some of the best AFX releases.\nGeorge McVicar.\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/11549498396/\" title=\"st-john-at-hackney by straylandings, on Flickr\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"st-john-at-hackney\" src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7450/11549498396_9563489a72_z.jpg\" width=\"640\"/></a>\n##William Basinski live at St John’s Church##\nSt John’s have recently been hosting an incredible range of experimental music from Fushitsusha to Actress to Tim Hecker, and the bizarre acoustics of the church coupled with the sheer beauty of the place makes it a perfect environment for any kind of live music. For this reason, I knew before I even entered the building that it was going to be a special one. Performing ‘Nocturnes’, Basinski played nostalgic, sepia-toned loops of creaky pianos and haunting murmurs, creating an intoxicating headspace and otherworldly atmosphere within the building.\nThe contorted and decaying loops creeped around the fragile pews of the church, giving the piece an air of authenticity that felt unique to that particular performance in that particular space. As the piece slowly concluded, the loops gradually became fainter and fainter, until they were excruciatingly quiet. With the room almost entirely silent, Basinski slumped back into his chair, letting out a deafening sigh of relief and allowing his arms to fall by his side. At that point, I felt like I hadn’t moved a muscle since it began, so entranced was I by the whole thing. “That’s it”, he announced, before skulking back off stage and out of view.\nGeorge McVicar.\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/11551808366/\" title=\"peverelist_650 by straylandings, on Flickr\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"peverelist_650\" src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7312/11551808366_085c38b23b_z.jpg\" width=\"640\"/></a>\n##Livity Sound##\nI always find I finish a year feeling it has been somewhat defined by a particular label, this year I’m sure that it comes as no surprise that this year it is Bristol Based Livity Sound. Comprised of Peverelist, Asusu and Kowton, they have put out more records this year than any previous. Their releases build upon a strong and recognisable sound which is still pushing the boundaries of what we expect, and surprising us with things we wouldn’t. The three show runners are prolific in their own right yet it is the way they work together which makes each match up so interesting to listen to. Each member contributes a clear and unique presence within their creations and leads the listener to detect the hallmarks for the individuality of each producer.\nThe year culminated in a series of live shows with Livity Sound performing as a group rather than a collection of producers which I feel shows the ideology around the label. They function as a mix and match set of guys who always deliver the goods. Their four hour Rinse FM podcast, for me was one of the best of the year. The continuity of the mixes and the direction that all three share make it clear why they function so well, they all have the same aim and this year they came closest to achieving it.\nOwen Lewis.\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/11715588206/\" title=\"Nile_Rodgers_01 by straylandings, on Flickr\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Nile_Rodgers_01\" height=\"89\" src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2814/11715588206_5266615c25_z.jpg\" width=\"640\"/></a>\n##A Love Letter to Nile Rodgers##\n<span>The inclusion of Nile Rodgers in this list might seem a bit incongruous, given that 2013 was a year in which he won no shortage of plaudits, and also produced an Avicii record. But production credits such as that are testament to quite how difficult it is for him to shit upon his legacy. We (Owen &amp; Rob) both agreed that he’d been an indomitable presence throughout the year for us, so decided to share some sentiments about him.</span>\n<span>Owen writes: From his godlike status as member of Chic in the heydays of New York disco, to producing for the likes of Madonna and Britney Spears, there is probably no man who has got more people dancing than Nile Rodgers. This year culminated in him being in the public eye more than ever, due to his collaboration with Daft Punk, and a rising interest in disco over the past few years; and for me it was a pleasure to be able to watch a man I admire so much for his work in the studio, actually performing in front of those he is able to give so much pleasure to. Although I wasn’t able to be there, I watched the TV broadcast of his Glastonbury performance with Chic.</span>\n<span>The camera was mostly trained on him for the performance and more importantly his pearly, heartwarming smile which was infectious even through the television set. After an emotional finale to the performance not only did I feel like I wanted to cover myself in glitter and ‘get down’, but I also felt a strange sense of pride at seeing an icon of mine be adored on a scale I feel he deserves.</span>\n<span>Rob writes: I was actually fortunate enough to see Chic at Bestival in September. There’s not much I can say about it – it was an unfathomable pleasure to end up lost in music at the behest of the man himself, and a thoroughly moving experience. That personal experience aside, Rodgers announced in July that he had beaten cancer, and as aforementioned, he co-wrote and starred on the year’s second biggest –selling (and most omnipresent) single; two things certainly worthy of a mention.</span>\n<span>While it certainly says a lot about the state of popular music that a man in his sixties has been the saving grace for megastars such as Daft Punk and Disclosure by collaborating with them, if it helps keep disco alive and brings the sound he helped pioneer to a younger generation, then there is some hope left. Remember kids: it don’t mean a thing if it ain’t got that swing.</span>\n<span>Owen Lewis &amp; Rob Heath.</span>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/11549408235/\" title=\"live527_1 by straylandings, on Flickr\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"live527_1\" src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5491/11549408235_fc62aeb791_z.jpg\" width=\"640\"/></a>\n##Discovering Derek Piotr##\nHaving discovered Derek Piotr through his <em>Raj</em> album from earlier this year, I was instantly intrigued by the combination of his extreme use of vocals, combined with erratic, processed industrial rhythms. A mix we hosted from Piotr a couple of months ago proved just how varied his taste is, providing a turbulent collage of eastern chant, glitch, pop and noise music. Following this we were graced with a free collaborative EP from Piotr &amp; co-producer Paul Heslin, the impact of which was a far cry from the ‘low-key collaboration’ penned in the duo’s press release.\nElectronic music rarely manages to be this diverse whilst maintaining a coherent, instantly recognisable signature. There are no doubt countless others out there, but Derek Piotr is one such artist who has helped to remind us why we began writing in the first place.\nTheo Darton-Moore.\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/11551716486/\" title=\"Pearson170913 by straylandings, on Flickr\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Pearson170913\" src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3828/11551716486_beb9922f84_z.jpg\" width=\"640\"/></a>\n##Hessle Audio at Fabric - Pearson Sound Drops ‘TFB’##\nWhen I went to Fabric in January for my inaugural club visit of 2013 I was expecting big things seeing as I had spent the last few hours deciding on who I was going to see and who was going to regrettably be sidelined. It’s fair to say that the line up was absolutely huge, yet the artist I would come home thinking of wasn’t even playing. Fellow SL contributors and I put our faith in Pearson Sound to start off our night and somewhere in the middle of the unrelenting percussion and big bass breaks there was one song that left us all begging reloads and asking anyone if they knew who, what, why and how? After realizing that we were being treated to an exclusive it fell to the most fearless of us to go up and shout at Chunky. When he came back he shouted at us over the opening snares “Kowton” and I could hear the name being passed around. \nAs a song it secured it’s self as being one of my favorites of the year despite being slightly over played. As a first listening experience it was one of the few songs that I remember in every detail, and causes fevered whispers on the dance floor, making it truly an unforgettable experience.\nOwen Lewis.\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/11714817755/\" title=\"601668_623570897654355_270019089_n by straylandings, on Flickr\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"601668_623570897654355_270019089_n\" height=\"89\" src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3693/11714817755_76c03dbe67_z.jpg\" width=\"640\"/></a>\n##<span>Cable Nightclub Closes</span>##\n<span>This is something I’d definitely rather not have happened this year, yet it is an event that will undoubtably be remembered by many with reference to 2013. Cable was one of the few venues left in London to make excellent use of an unconventional space, whilst simultaneously becoming revered in multiple scenes for its diverse, expertly curated parties. </span>\n<span></span><span>Having been ousted by National Rail for ‘development’ despite being previously assured their plans would not infringe of the nightclub’s running, the closing of Cable has left a notable vacuum is London’s clubbing scene. This said, I have little doubt that 2014 won’t pass without the iconic brand setting up in another location – let’s hope it happens sooner rather than later.</span>\n<span></span><span>Theo Darton-Moore.</span>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/11715588176/\" title=\"a4e6148808b56c230fab6dfe005956_1380744_10151699183151629_1445479731_n by straylandings, on Flickr\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"a4e6148808b56c230fab6dfe005956_1380744_10151699183151629_1445479731_n\" height=\"89\" src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7385/11715588176_a7b82d146d_z.jpg\" width=\"640\"/></a>\n##Half Baked Workshop With Perc##\nA relatively late event in the year but no less noteworthy for it, December 10<sup>th</sup> saw the second of Half Baked’s interview/Q&amp;A sessions, hosted in Hackney Wick’s most recently established trendy place, Number 90. With Mike Huckaby invited to conduct the first, the second saw the man behind the Perc moniker and affiliated label Perc Trax, Ali Wells discuss techno, and his musical history.\nWells is someone who I would consider one of the most stable and sought after Techno DJs and producers of the past decade, so the opportunity to hear him talk about early rave culture, the influence of his brother, and his years working at a distribution company was naturally incredibly insightful.\nMichael Feghali.\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/11551722573/\" title=\"hecq by straylandings, on Flickr\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"hecq\" src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5502/11551722573_e71cc183c0_z.jpg\" width=\"640\"/></a>\n##Ben Lukas Boysen – ‘Eos’ ##\nFor an artist to shed a moniker, particularly one that has been going for over eleven years, is always a brave thing to do. You run the risk of alienating your audience, or receiving less coverage as a result of your new, unfamiliar name.\nThis year, Ben Lukas Boysen took the bold move, releasing a new album, <em>Gravity</em> under his real name rather than his renowned ‘Hecq’ alias. The decision was, I think, an appropriate one; this album was not like stuff Boysen had released before.\nInstead of focusing on technical intricacy and dynamic power, <em>Gravity</em> showcased a more feminine side to Boysen’s music, creating an album that sounded altogether more personal and heartfelt. However, one track, ‘Eos’, stands out for me above the others in this regard. The unbearably delicate and mournful pianos demand such attention that I find it difficult to concentrate on or think about anything else whilst it’s playing. For two minutes and thirty-nine seconds, that piece is the only thing that’s going on - it’s pretty much the Bernard’s Watch of music.\nGeorge McVicar.\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/11715078233/\" title=\"Ambika-2_f by straylandings, on Flickr\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Ambika-2_f\" height=\"89\" src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2858/11715078233_22b50e86a2_z.jpg\" width=\"640\"/></a>\n<span>##<span>Emptyset at Ambika P3</span>##</span>\n<span><span>Over the past few years there have been plenty of instances of producers establishing their musical practice away from clubs and in the contemporary gallery setting. From Lee Gamble, Alexander Nut, and Craig Richards mixing in front </span></span><span><span><span>of Turner, Constable, and Blake; to Oneohtrix Point Never turning whole rooms within Tate Britain into light and sound installations, there are as many spaces for producers to explore with their music as they could imagine.</span></span></span>\n<span><span><span>When techno duo Emptyset teamed up with the Architecture Foundation to hold free events at spaces across the UK, I saw that they would be performing at the Ambika P3 gallery just across from Baker Street station, and wandered down there with a group of friends - some of who were going because they liked Emptyset, and some because the gallery was one they visited often and were intrigued.</span></span></span>\n<span><span><span>I somewhat expected that it would be an atmospheric and challenging experience and it didn’t disappoint: on walking in I was hit with bone-shaking bass within the pitch black. Before my eyes were able to adjust, the sound ebbed away and a single light, hanging from the high, steel raftered ceiling, began to grow brighter until it seemed it was unable to hold its brightness anymore and slowly died as the droning note returned. For about an hour we wandered around the building experiencing the light and sound, which they reflected each other, both working on a series of ever-undulating peaks and troughs.</span></span></span>\n<span><span><span>Sometimes one lead on from the other and occasionally they performed in complete unison (which doesn’t sound amazing but was actually very exciting). It was a powerful installation and part of the enjoyment I got out of it was the conversations it prompted with others; it became an open discussion between people primarily interested in different mediums. Occasionally installations of this nature can seem indulgent, yet it was able to be more than just weird sounds and trippy lights (although it was totally that aswell). It was able to legitimize itself in the new context, and although it’s links with the music of Emptyset were apparent, it also succeeded in being a separate venture for the two.</span></span></span>\nOwen Lewis.\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/11551713836/\" title=\"THE-KNIFE by straylandings, on Flickr\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"THE-KNIFE\" src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2887/11551713836_6c0a6dce77_z.jpg\" width=\"640\"/></a>\n##The Knife – Shaking the Habitual (in particular, two minutes and nine seconds into ‘A Tooth for an Eye’)##\nAs happens with any semi-popular music that happens to not fit neatly into the well-established boxes of the album format, The Knife’s masterpiece <em>Shaking the Habitual</em> was widely labelled a concept album, whatever the fuck that means. As if music is by default lacking in content, and as if the Swedish duo’s feminist critiques of hyper-capitalism only make sense when understood within the context of a superimposed story the album is trying to tell. <br/>Moreover, in the case of a record as diverse and nuanced as <em>Shaking the Habitual</em>, such an approach does violence to it. Some of the music press’s worst offenders made claims such as “Shaking seems to have “inaccessible” etched into every fiber of its DNA”, apparently evidenced by how the record is “is 98 minutes long” (Lindsay Zoladz of Pitchfork taking a dim view of her readers’ attention spans).\nSimilarly, The Guardian’s cretin-in-chief and professional dilettante Alex Petridis bemoaned how “the impact of a track such as Full of Fire – distorted drums, horrifying shrieks – is dissipated by the fact that it rambles on for nine minutes”, in a staggering example of missing the point. Let’s keep all abrasive elements to a minimum, lest, god forbid, they actually become abrasive.\nFrom the Bubbling House influences of the aforementioned ‘Full of Fire’, the album takes in techno, ambient, industrial, drone, synth-pop, and a whole lot else in between; drawing heavily from a panoply of global grooves and urban dance musics. Succinctly and appropriately enough, the genre’s record shows up on my media player as simply ‘Styles’, which makes a lot more sense than trying pigeonhole it as anything more specific.\nI didn’t manage to properly catch the Shaking the Habitual live show, although I did have chances to. I saw about five minutes of it on a rainy late night at a festival, and I remember it being fairly extraordinary, all synchronised dancers and bright lights. Unfortunately I had other commitments and left to go elsewhere. Maybe it was better that way - for those few minutes it was utterly magical and perhaps staying there any longer would have shattered the illusion. The tour passed through the UK, but I balked at the £35 ticket price. Resolution for 2014: stop being so cheap.\nRob Heath.\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/11690678254/\" title=\"457000447_640 by straylandings, on Flickr\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"457000447_640\" src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7392/11690678254_5764aee3d9_z.jpg\" width=\"640\"/></a>\n##D’Marc Cantu – ‘Size &amp; Shape’ (Alternate Frequency EP)##\nNot necessarily my favourite track of the year, but it’s always in my head, and is a perfect example of the simple and delectable house and techno hybrids that have made DJ TLR’s Crème Organization such a revered imprint.\nRob Heath.\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/11551838294/\" title=\"Barbagianna-BorsettiVenier - Minarelli 1 by straylandings, on Flickr\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Barbagianna-BorsettiVenier - Minarelli 1\" src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7345/11551838294_33e7c93217_z.jpg\" width=\"640\"/></a>\n##Enzo Minarelli at Colour Out of Space Festival (6th edition)##\nAs tends to happen at Dylan Nyoukis and Karen Constance’s supremely curated Colour Out of Space festival in Brighton, I saw Italian sound-poet Enzo Minarelli perform knowing absolutely nothing about him. Some research since reveals him to be quite the polymath – a video-poet, visual-poet, and plain old manipulation-of-words-poet. He’s on YouTube, look him up.\nThe performance was brief, bizarre, hilarious, confusing; but engaging because of and not in spite of its frivolity. I don’t know whether everyone would call it music, but I don’t think that even matters. It was more interesting than anything I heard in a nightclub this year.\nRob Heath.\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/11549253754/\" title=\"ikeda by straylandings, on Flickr\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ikeda\" src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5475/11549253754_9b6709dc98_z.jpg\" width=\"640\"/></a>\n##Ryoji Ikeda’s ‘Datamatics’ at Brighton Dome##\nHaving witnessed various debauched audience members making a nuisance of themselves despite the early running time, I might be tempted to argue British crowds don’t do their reputations any favours when it comes to attending performances like these. This, alongside several needless interruptions however, was not enough to detract from the breathtaking experience of Ryoji Ikeda’s audiovisual realisation of software coding, through his ‘Datamatics’ show. The hour long show seemed to be the epitome of the Raster-Noton aesthetic, clearly defined segments of crisp, greyscale graphics interacting with static-laced glitch and penetrating blasts of low-end.\nIkeda has long been considered one of Japan’s finest exports when it comes to experimental electronic music, and it isn’t hard to see why given how unconventional, and highly inventive his methods of music making are.\nTheo Darton-Moore.\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/11549496056/\" title=\"timthumb by straylandings, on Flickr\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"timthumb\" height=\"89\" src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2830/11549496056_8771d6a710_z.jpg\" width=\"640\"/></a>\n##Monad Series XIV-XVI ##\nStroboscopic Artefacts really outdid themselves this year. With exceptional albums from both Zeitgeber and Dadub, as well as a wealth of remixes put out, it was genuinely hard to keep track of all the staggering music that was coming from the label. However, this year their renowned Monad Series reached a new high and it’s these that I think made Stroboscopic really stand out this year. \nLakker, Monad XIV – The first Monad instalment of 2013 was perhaps the most surprising, signalling the subtle shift in direction the label has taken over the last few months. Rather than providing jams for 24-hour warehouse parties, this EP felt more considered and contemplative than previous releases on the series. In particular, ‘Asvatta’ played around with enchanting (and chilling) sound design, creating some truly unique textures. \nPlaster, Monad XV – I think this EP must have the strongest staying power for me of any other this year. Despite being released in mid-August, its thick, synthetic textures and punchy kicks have seen me revisiting the EP time and time again. Take a listen to ‘Uret’ and you’ll see what I mean – completely unrelenting and ‘no nonsense’, Plaster did not fuck about on this EP one bit. \nRrose, Monad XVI – With each new release, Rrose seems to set the bar at an ever-dizzying height. Needless to say this EP was no exception, with some masterfully constructed drones and dreamlike soundscapes. My personal highlight, ‘Kneeling’ felt like the direction I’ve been waiting for Rrose to move into for a while – applying faultless technical expertise to map out a truly inventive and abstract piece of electronic music. \nWith such high quality music on this series, it’s a shame that none of it has yet been pressed to vinyl, but let’s not get greedy now; there’s still lots more to come.\nGeorge McVicar.\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/11690894376/\" title=\"tr034-2 by straylandings, on Flickr\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"tr034-2\" height=\"88\" src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7334/11690894376_e6295ff39d_z.jpg\" width=\"640\"/></a>\n##Trensmat##\nIrish label Trensmat, run by noisy duo Whirling Hall Of Knives, has been going since 2006, but given that I only became aware of the label in mid-2012, I can’t even say if 2013 was a vintage year by their standards (although a glance at their Discogs page suggests the standard is pretty high – plenty more to get my teeth into). Regardless, they put out two of my favourite LPs in 2013, from two of my favourite musicians.</p>\n<p>Gnod, my major musical revelation of the year, presented an eponymous release from two of their members, Dwellings and Druss, a collection of analogue electronic pieces with the miasma of a dungeon (or at least sweaty basement). The other LP was by an old favourite, Neil Campbell, under his Astral Social Club moniker, entitled <em>Electric Yep</em>. I also picked up T15DM’s <em>Scheming Things</em> 12”, four tracks of berserk electro; and Stave’s recent 12” <em>Trust</em>. The labels self-described sound is drone, noise, oscillations &amp; grooves, which is a pretty accurate description of the above four releases, and from what I’ve heard, the output of the label is a meeting point of most of the stuff I’m into, covering drone, noise, techno, shoegaze – all sorts of scuzzy electronics basically. Go and buy some of their records.</span></p>\n",

The release is perhaps the most diverse of the three, from the paranoid industrial textures of Comer’s ‘One Of The Strangest Things’ or Akzidenz’s ‘Lullaby For Scum V’, to Derek Piotr’s glitchy vocal experiment, ‘K4L1’, or the crawling gothic-techno of Harry Murdoch &amp; KSK’s ‘No Light’.</p>\n<p>Alongside the free digital release on the 17th January, we have also put together a limited run of the handcrafted CDs, which includes a second disc featuring a collaborative, fourty minute soundscape crafted by the selection of artists featured on the general compilation.</p>\n<p>The physical release is available currently via our bandcamp page <a href=\"http://straylandings.bandcamp.com/album/parallel-stress-2\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>You can download the digital version of the compilation for free, <a href=\"http://www.mediafire.com/download/mm1b0iaxgx6b646/Stray+Landings_Parallel+Stress.zip\">here</a>.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/133026262?color=ffffff&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"540\" height=\"303\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> ",

This said, from the sounds of his latest 12” for Divvorce &amp; Hound Scales’ Fifth Wall imprint, this time hasn’t been spent idly - the five track EP displays an impressively refined take on the Metrist sound, which has matured significantly since his debut on Nineteen89 Records early last year.</p>\n<p>The ‘Doorman In Formant’ EP see’s Metrist voyage into the deeper recesses of experimental Techno. Glitchy, mechanical sound-design takes centre stage, whilst still managing to prove effective in terms of functionality with a stripped back, spartan outlook on percussion.</p>\n<p>Opening track ‘Third Law’ sets the tone with hollow industrial textures which remain a dominating feature throughout the EP. A minute in and the track hints at developing into something more melodic with fuzzed out chords, before sharply cutting back to Metrist’s oddball mix of grating drums &amp; R2D2 beeps and bleeps.</p>\n<p>We are also offered a sullen remix from Lakker member Eomac which takes a deeper, more introspective approach, introducing muffled swathes of reverent organ. Eomac also deconstructed the track’s percussive elements, leaving a dampened, skeletal variant on the original’s muscular groove.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact  that ‘Doorman in Formant’ is undoubtedly a techno release, third track ‘Lofstrom’ is the only offering to  make use of traditional four to the floor rhythms; sharp bleeps and bursts of computer noise helping propel the track rhythmically.</p>\n<p>Heaving, oddball percussive workout ‘Leviathanks’ follows this; discordant stabs blasting through stuttered, brokenbeat drums and swelling drones. Percussion is layered up slowly rasping hi-hats clattering through the mix before fading away at equal pace.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/125368001&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Whatever their personal relationships may be, it’s clear that both artists have a strong sense of what the Greek producer is about, the two remixes featured here being wonderfully complementary to the release as a whole.</p>\n<p>Kondaktor’s noisey, brooding soundscapes make up the initial two tracks of the release, heavily processed field recordings calling to mind the work of an artist like Russell Haswell or the solo work of Deaf Centre’s Svarte Greiner. A droning wall of discordant fuzz occupies ‘Signal#1’, becoming increasingly abrasive as it progresses from its murky beginnings, as if some unknown horror, slowly surfacing from the depths.</p>\n<p>Paranoid radio tuning sounds make up the basis of ‘Signal#2’, cutting in sharply above low-end rumblings and sporadically placed, ominous drones.</p>\n<p>On the b-side, Athens based ANFS turns in an echoing, percussive recast of ‘Signal#1’ partially taming Kondaktor’s shuddering soundscapes with the introduction of sparsely placed industrial hits, calling to mind Samuel Kerridge’s recent album, <em>A Fallen Empire</em>.</p>\n<p>Following this, Perc Trax regular Sawf also opts to inject rhythm into his remix of ‘Signal#2’, be it in a rather abstract sense. Boiling the original down to a jittering, crumpled bass riff, the track churns restlessly across six and a half minutes, vapourous atmospherics and and piercing hi-end easing in and out of the mix.</p>\n<p>This latest release sees Modal Analysis explore more leftfield territory than they have perhaps done previously, the shift away dancefloor offerings making this a label I am very intrigued to watch the development of over 2014.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/129622090&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

With the the groove laden three tracker having sold out recently, the release of their successive 12”, the ‘02-14’ EP seems timed all the better.</p>\n<p>Whilst the first EP straddled the House &amp; Techno crossover to some extent, this following release shifts to a much darker perspective. Whilst occupying a more brooding, dub-inflected sonic territory, Möd3rn still manage to keep a firm grip on the propulsive dancefloor rhythms that made the first EP so infectious.</p>\n<p>Dubby, stuttering synths open first track ‘Mö4’. These echoing, atmospheric blasts are regimented by pounding industrial rhythms, creating a brooding march beneath the comparatively wild melodic components. This results in a rather interesting juxtaposition, sounding something like how a Planetary Assault Systems remix of someone like Vladislav Delay might sound.</p>\n<p>The mesmeric ‘Mö5’ follows a similar mediation between dub and industrial Techno, balancing propulsive stabs with muscular drums that fill even the slightest of spaces.</p>\n<p>'Mö6' takes a slightly more restrained approach, better suited to early-hour sets than it's peak-time counterparts. Claustrophobic low-end rumbles ominously beneath filtering hi-end percussion and evenly placed stabs, echoing out in the track's dynamic builds and breakdowns.</p>\n<p>The second release from Möd3rn may do little more to illuminate their personal history and back story (I still couldn’t tell you the names of those involved or how the project was formed), yet in terms of revealing more about their sound, the 02-14’ EP definitely fills a few blank pages.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/19221944&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.subskank.com/\">Sub Skank</a>\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 10/02/2014</p>\n<p>Upon receiving this EP I wasn’t that familiar with Akito, although he is a producer who has been on the peripherals of my listening habits for a while. I had been told the release was out via Sub Skank, giving me some idea of what would be about to scream out of the speakers, having me reloading iTunes for the rest of my Thursday afternoon.</p>\n<p>I click play excitedly on the first track ‘Metamessage (Original Mix)’, and at first I am surprised. The beat seems relatively slow compared to what I expected, but as the track progresses more intricate percussive elements are introduced, speeding up the track until a familiar tension gripped my anatomy, my body predicting the abominable drop. When it comes the sound is surprising, a harsh melody reminiscent of early noughties grime, yet because this melody isn’t force fed to you at 140 BPM the listening experience is able to be considered; the slower tempo meaning you can digest it more carefully. This bass centric melody modulates through abrasive snare rhythms which are unremitting throughout, processed to keep the track sounding fresh for its duration.</p>\n<p>The alternate mix of ‘Metamessage’ is not to be sniffed at as a rehashing; the percussion isn’t as powerful but allows the fullness of the bass motifs to drive the track. It’s also slightly faster, meaning it loses none of the heart-pounding excitement the percussion gives to the original.</p>\n<p>The third offering is a rolling bass medley mixed with industrial signals and chopped vocals producing something which might not be the most memorable from the EP, but should not to be looked over because of it.</p>\n<p>It is the finale track that really got my attention however. A dusty haze of percussion mudded in reverb slowly builds, until the tension breaks with a series of carefully placed sub-snare hits which form a rhythm difficult for your feet to ignore. After this main break the sustained reverb notes return but with elements of the break now intertwined, turning what was initially promised as a foot stompingly riotous beat pattern into something a little more reflective, before a fury of drums return once again.</p>\n<p>'Metamessage' is an EP made for those who wish for their beats to knock their pint from their hand, grab them by the nose and pull them into a group of sweaty clubbers who care little for how they are perceived by the chin strokers at the back. Its tracks demand to be listened to through the use of sounds which are difficult to master but once they are become all too contagious with their energy.</p>\n<p>Akito has employed a fusion of downtempo dubstep and grime made popular over the past few years by labels like Night Slugs, a movement which has my firm approval (not that it needs it). Akitos contribution to this scene is one which I’m thankful for, sounds which do what they say on the tin. And they do it well.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/19234980&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.clr.net/\">CLR</a>\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> 12”/Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 13/02/2014</p>\n<p>Moe Espinosa, who produces techno under the name Drumcell, has spoken previously about his involvement in punk bands growing up in Los Angeles, and an interest in ‘aggressive’ music; which has manifested itself in an engagement with industrial, noise, and more experimental strands of electronic music, rather than simply quotidian club music. This broader outlook finds expression in CLR’s first release of 2014, which sees three musicians from various backgrounds interpret ‘Speak Silence’, a cut from the Californian’s debut LP <em>Sleep Complex</em>, which was released at the end of last summer on the same label. <em>Sleep Complex</em> was a clear progression from Espinoza’s releases on his own Droid Recordings, marking another waypoint in the course of industrial-tinged techno that has its roots in the 1990s, such as in the so-called ‘Birmingham Sound’. Like Karl O’Connor and others associated with the Downwards label, a key node that Birmingham scene, Espinosa is not afraid to play with hardware, or with structure, often drifting from the confines of a steady 4/4.</p>\n<p>The original ‘Speak Silence’ is included here along with the remixes. Characterised by a half-tempo kick drum, the track lumbers along lugubriously, but never stumbling. Each kick punctures space like a piece of assembly line machinery unremittingly stamping down upon all that comes before it, before being fleshed out with a collection of whirring arpeggios and a humanoid voice talking almost at a drawl. Espinosa has also talked of a desire to stay true to techno’s historical character of being ‘raw, dirty, hypnotic, and repetitive’, which he achieves on ‘Speak Silence’ through the almost perpetual pulsing of the aforementioned kick, which draws in everything around it into orbit with gravitational force.</p>\n<p>Slumberman is a name I was unfamiliar with, and who I have struggled to track down almost any information at all about, save the hint in <em>Speak Silence</em>’s press release, which claims that ‘there are rumours that the creator of this remix is the member of a much respected Rock band, but nothing has been confirmed yet…’. Whoever the mystery rockstar is, they change the mood of ‘Speak Silence’ dramatically by layering new chords over a regular 4/4 pulse and embalming the whole thing in a layer of gentle, distorted, haze. Whilst the chords don’t really do it for me, the grainy textures, particularly towards the end, resonate with me, and it demands a different kind of emotional engagement to the original.</p>\n<p>Brian Sanhaji’s and Francesco Tristano’s remixes are where the release really shines however, each in virtue of quite different reasons. Sanhaji, who oversees mastering for CLR, is an unsurprising choice of remixer; but Tristano, a pianist and composer from Luxembourg, is a more surprising inclusion. Admittedly, Tristano has worked with Carl Craig, a name synonymous with techno; but Craig’s music has a warmth that Espinosa’s eshews and which makes the Detroit veteran a less unexpected collaborator.</p>\n<p>Sanhaji’s re-work is the most straightforward and jackin’ piece of techno across the release, and is slightly less abrasive and chaotic than 2012’s <em>Split Structure</em> EP, a collaboration between Sanhaji and Espinosa also on CLR. Sanhaji turns out the most DJ-friendly of the four tracks, but to classify it as a mere DJ tool would belie the narrative and contours the track traces. The final three minutes transform the hypnotic trance induced by the original, turning the anxiety into a beautiful tension.</p>\n<p>Much like Slumberman, Tristano effects a change in mood from anxiety and alienation to something more inviting, but harder to place, with a gentle piano melody and chords hinting at something just out of reach, beyond the horizon of meaning. Given it’s retention of the half-tempo kick and some of the rough timbres of the original, it’s surprising quite how pleasant and calming Tristano’s remix is. The meeting of styles here could create some sort of offensively inoffensive chillout music, but the result is actually quite extraordinary, a perfectly balanced eight minutes.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/81133499?portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff\" width=\"640\"></iframe>",

However, given the little media attention received for this EP, and the meager 150 Soundcloud followers Boks has, we feel an obligation (nay, a duty) to promote this fantastic EP – quite possibly one of the best from last year and criminally overlooked.</p>\n<p>The EP opens with the unapologetically heavy title track, ‘12113’. The track thunders along for over seven unrelenting minutes, powered by its propulsive, oscillating, low end, from which there is no respite.</p>\n<p>'Ovissheten' stands in stark contrast to the opener, bravely adopting a beatless soundscape reminiscent of Tim Hecker’s ‘Harmony In Ultraviolet’. This provides a perfect calm between the intensity of '12113' and the final track, 'Yma'.</p>\n<p>’Yma’ brings back the propulsive low-end that Joy Boks began with, but this time arpeggiated and percussive, giving a more dynamic feel altogether. The ominous arpeggio continues throughout, while other elements creep in and out of the mix as they please. This for me, is the standout track of the EP, and while I’m yet to hear it played out, it’s not hard to imagine the extent to which it could tear up the dancefloor when played at the right time. For these techno offerings on the EP, it’s the heavy thundering bass, changing fragmentarily as it progresses, that makes them stand out. ‘Yma’ does this best; it’s a true adventure.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/115004647&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>The career of Minneapolis raised Bryan Black has been a rather interesting one. Originally training in graphic design, Black’s career took a surprising turn after he was recruited by Prince to work as a sound designer after the pop veteran saw him performing as part of industrial-rock band, Haloblack.</p>\n<p>From here Black went on to form Motor, a project born out of a desire to combat the staling of the techno scene, which was becoming all too formulaic at the time. This desire to innovate and challenge also lay at the centre of Black’s subsequent solo project, Black Asteroid, which is where he seems to have found his creative home.</p>\n<p>With the video for his recent CLR release ‘Grind’ premiered today, and a performance at Fabric scheduled for the 22nd, we caught up with Black to discuss his live setup, recent relocation to NYC, and breaking into the world of fashion.</p>\n<p><strong>So first off how are things? You put out the Grind EP towards the end of last year - how has the reception been?</strong></p>\n<p>Great thanks, I recorded Grind with Chris Liebing in Frankfurt after a Depeche Mode concert. After two days we had an EP. Grind is always a highlight in my sets, I was surprised that guys like Tommy Sunshine are playing it. Its great when techno can reach outside of its comfort zone.</p>\n<p><strong>You’re playing live at Fabric on the 22nd February, can you tell us a little bit about your setup for live performances?</strong></p>\n<p>I usually break apart my tracks into samples which I trigger live with an assortment of controllers. This way I can go as hard or deep as I want, building a track from nothing into a big climax and then breaking it down or going straight into a new beat. I’m interested in the performance aspect in techno. The music is so bonkers, so it seems fitting to have such a physically exhausting show and have fun with the audience.</p>\n<p><strong>You lived in London for a while after moving in 2002, am I right in saying you are currently based in New York however? What was it that prompted the second move?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes I grew up in Minneapolis, and moved to London to finish my graphic design/multimedia degree, and I accidentally stumbled into techno. I ended up staying in London for about 8-9 years. We had an amazing studio in Old Street and there was so much going on, I didn’t want to go home. At one point, everyone was moving to Berlin, and I didn’t want to be another hipster DJ moving to Berlin. My girlfriend landed a great job in NYC, so we got up and left. I do cherish my trips back to London. I had an apartment just down the street from Fabric when I was living there, so I still get flashbacks of walking home from Fabric in the early morning completely shattered, ear ringing, but inspired.</p>\n<p><strong>It sounds like the original intention with your Motor project was to challenge and push boundaries in the Techno scene, do you think the same impulse is behind the Black Asteroid project?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. Motor was an experiment because at the time techno was so boring, so we added a little punk/ rock element and it went nuts. After everyone was doing it - it wasn’t fun anymore, so we kept experimenting with different sounds.</p>\n<p>Just after we finished the last Motor album, we took a break. During this time I was clubbing with my techno DJ friends, and again I found myself inspired to try a new take on techno, it felt like there was a gaping hole for something with more bollocks and soul/ character. And so in one hour I wrote the first Black Asteroid single ‘Engine 1’ which became this big thing so quickly.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of the Motor project, how did you first meet Olivier Grasset and at what point did you decide to work together?</strong></p>\n<p>We met in London through friends. I was looking for a drummer for my industrial band ‘Haloblack’. We realised we both had a similar record collection and a love of DAF. So we immediately ditched the guitars and drums and went head first into making pure electronic music, which soon became Motor.</p>\n<p><strong>You posted a couple of pictures taken from Rick Owens’ fashion shows on your Facebook recently - can we expect to see a Black Asteroid clothing line in the near future?</strong></p>\n<p>I am flirting with these ideas more and more. Rick Owens is contributing to the art for my debut album. Im working with a label called Obscur on a Black Asteroid limited edition piece of clothing. Im always looking for interesting ways to deliver music, and the physical product is very important to me.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3834/12501564525_a32cf9f57f_n.jpg\" alt=\"Rick Owens\"></p>\n<p><strong>The video for Black Acid also featured the model Nadia Shapoval, would you say the fashion scene is a big inspiration on your music?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes by accident I was thrown into this world. First Raf Simons and then Rick Owens started using my music for runway shows. I only discovered this on Youtube by chance.</p>\n<p>In general I’m not into what is mainstream fashion. Its all too preppy for me. I don’t understand why everyone wants to look like a banker/ accountant. So I discovered a few designers producing clothes which are complimentary to the music I was making.</p>\n<p>I’ve always been obsessed with packaging and design for all my releases, and this is just the next step.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally, I believe I am right in saying the debut Black Asteroid LP is in the final stages at the moment. Can you tell us a little bit about the record and when it will be released?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, I am right now in Frankfurt mixing it down. I have another mixing session in New York soon after that, and then it will be complete. Besides the Rick Owens cover art collaboration, I have Cold Cave contributing vocals which I’m really excited about. We’re aiming for a release just after the Summer. In the meantime I have a new EP coming out on Electric Deluxe on April 7th.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/57160804&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> <a href=\"http://illegalalienrecords.bandcamp.com/\">Illegal Alien Records</a>\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 10/02/2014</p>\n<p>Irish sister duo Lisa &amp; Alice Wallace aka L.A.W are becoming something of a favourite here at Stray Landings. With previous releases on Rebekah’s Decoy Records and Slap Jaxx Music, their latest ‘Critter’ EP via Illegal Alien Records is perhaps our favourite to date, featuring two L.A.W originals backed by remixes from Chris Colburn &amp; Mexican producer Fixeer.</p>\n<p>L.A.W’s thickly textured ‘Repulse’ opens the EP, a track with a surprising amount of groove given how powerful it is. The track’s slowly developing atmospheres and earth-shaking warehouse aesthetic wouldn’t sound out of place in a mix by Oscar Mulero or Collabs 3000.</p>\n<p>Chris Colburn follows up with a stripped-back remix of the original, booming 4/4 kick drums taking focus in this offering to small hours techno. Along with Colburn’s general economising of the track, he strips back the track’s synth line to a sparsely placed, molten clang, pulsing beneath a dense low-end rumble.</p>\n<p>Rugged, machine-like sounds dominate no-holds-barred title track ‘Critter’. In essence, the track’s formula is a rather simple one, yet the interaction between the Wallace’s hammering kicks and rushing clap phrases makes for some pretty euphoric moments, and will be an undoubtable favourite on the dancefloor.</p>\n<p>Closing the release is a reinterpretation of the track by Fixeer. Having not heard of the DJ/producer previously, I was curious to see what the result would be. Fixeer brings an edge to the track reminiscent of Brian Sanhaji, with his frequent use of slow, reverberant buildups. Similarly to Colburn’s remix Fixeer takes a much more minimalist approach to the track, the contrasting approaches making for a well balanced release.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/22741027&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

The tenth EP in the series, ‘Acouasm’ crafted by label-owner Algo, occupies itself with a range of freeform experiments in synthesis, resulting in four dark, techno leaning cuts sounding something like the internet did when we still used dialup.</p>\n<p>Piercing feedback loops and clattering industrial percussion make up opening track ‘CNX’. Algo’s complex mesh of raw industrial noises are reminiscent of Russell Haswell’s productions, oddball filtered beeps occasionally stabbing through the mix.</p>\n<p>The buzzing ‘Thermionic Trigger’ follows, grating throbs of distortion adding a more easily identifiable pulse to Algo’s stumbling drum patterns. Bursts of what sounds like a detuned accordion occasionally enter the jumbled sway, adding a sense of unease, despite the fact this is the only timbre which doesn’t feel completely mechanical.</p>\n<p>Third track ‘Isoechoic’ is a notable highlight on the EP, calling to mind Ryoji Ikeda’s methodical, patch based approach to production. Churning industrial textures and printer-processing sounds slowly build up tension across the track’s two and a half minute duration before dissipating suddenly in its closing segment.</p>\n<p>Closing the release is ‘Static Propagation’, a crawling, apocalyptic offering brimming with discordant textures and grating, glitch-laced percussion. A booming metallic hit breaks through the swamp of distorted sounds at a steady interval, closing the EP with a sense of impending destruction.</p>\n<p>Whilst Algorhythms obviously isn’t aiming itself at any sort of mainstream recognition, it’s still a shame to see the label receiving such little attention given the high calibre of its releases, which to my match the standards of Modal Analysis or PAN.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/19035179&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Label: <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/sylphemusic\">Sylphe Records</a>\nFormat: Limited 12”\nRelease Date: 13/02/14</p>\n<p>By this stage I think it’s fair to say Sylphe Records have hit their stride somewhat; the London based label’s regularly paced string of releases maintaining a consistently high-standard. With its fifth edition, the imprint’s two person roster Holdie Gawn &amp; Micawber break in the first release of 2014, continuing their experiments in leftfield analogue house.</p>\n<p>'Thron' opens proceedings with aquatic filter sweeps barbed percussion riding a familiar 4/4 pulse, before the introduction of a squelching riff several minutes in. This is joined periodically by what sounds like distant whale song, adding direction to Holdie Gawn's otherwise atonal synth-play.</p>\n<p>Charting similarly abstract territory, Micawber’s ‘F7’ occupies the b-side of the release. There is something remiscent of Lowtec or Jan Jelinek in the track’s subtle glitches and delicate micro-house sway, booming low-end lending a sturdy groove easy for Micawber to build around. As the track progresses it begins to take a more improvisational tone, distorted breaks cutting sharply through ‘F7’s alien arpeggios and buzzing atmospheres.</p>\n<p>The avoidance of usual riffs or basslines in this latest release means the duo’s more experimental tendencies can take full-focus. For me, this has always been the most interesting aspect of the label’s releases, making Sylphe 05 a strong contender for my favourite in the series.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/124256650&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>These days known better by the L.A.W acronym which they produce rugged warehouse techno under, the background of Irish sisters Lisa &amp; Alice Wallace is perhaps not what you’d expect. “Our parents are both from farming backgrounds and live active lifestyles so we were always kept busy growing up. If we ever wanted to watch TV, we had to knit. Not cool.” they begin when we asked the duo about their musical history earlier this month. “One of our weekly ‘distractions’ was attending piano lessons from a very young age, sometimes dragged to lessons being typical nightmare kids; we were reluctant to practice, but we are now thankful for our mother’s persistence. Our family were also members of the local flute band – there are seven in our family, so we pretty much made up half the band! Lisa also studied music in school and university. Our first family holiday to Ibiza back in 1999 led us to dance music; we visited a record shop in San Antonio and heard this music over the soundsystem that pretty much blew our minds. The obsession went from there, to aspiring to be DJs ‘when we grew up!’”</p>\n<p>After realising this aspiration, the progression from DJing into production seemed only natural for the pair. “When we first heard dance music we wanted to become DJs to make people dance and that has naturally led into producing as we want to make music to let people feel how we do when music gives us the butterflies.”</p>\n<p>Having had their first release with Slap Jaxx Records, the pair have gone on to release with Rebekah’s tightly curated Decoy imprint, gaining support for their full-throttle approach to industrial techno. “We were really happy with the feedback the ‘Condemner EP’ received and it’s cool to have a release alongside some amazing producers on Rebekah’s label. We have always been inspired by Rebekah; her productions, sets and work-ethos are on another level and she is fresh proof that females can be taken seriously and be successful within such a male-dominated genre.”</p>\n<p>Alongside continued support from Rebekah, Dave Clarke has also been a keen supporter of the L.A.W. Project, picking them as winners of the Demo Demolition Competition at ADE 2012. “Dave is one of those people that we get completely star-struck with; talented, knowledgeable, hilarious and never predictable.” they explain of their relationship with Dave. “We have followed his Whitenoise show for years and would encourage anyone to do so; there is something for everyone in there. He educates, crosses many genres sophistically, is truly passionate about every aspect of music and makes time for listening to unknown producers. We sent Dave a promo of our debut ‘AWOL EP’ in 2012 which he supported on his radio show and in his sets, which was a real personal achievement for us.”</p>\n<p>With the recent release of their Illegal Alien EP, ‘Critter’, L.A.W. have graced us with an exclusive mix, road testing the recent release alongside some older favourites. “We are strong believers that good music does not have a shelf-life. We included tracks from our favourite labels and producers and some very talented up-coming artists. We didn’t hold back with this mix – it’s a hardy one… and we hope you enjoy it!”</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Mael // Ozon [Unknown]</li>\n<li>Shards // Illape [Mord]</li>\n<li>Ricardo Garduno // Hologram [Brood Audio]</li>\n<li>L.A.W. // Critter (Fixeer remix) [Illegal Alien Records]</li>\n<li>Future 16 // Vertigo [Amazone Records]</li>\n<li>John Mitchell // Sequenced Events [Unknown]</li>\n<li>Ricardo Garduno // Lie After Lie [Brood Audio]</li>\n<li>Forward Strategy Group // Code 3 [Perc Trax]</li>\n<li>L.A.W. // Critter [Illegal Alien Records]</li>\n<li>Rocco Caine // Code Sui [Driving Forces]</li>\n<li>L.A.W. // Repulse [Illegal Alien Records]</li>\n<li>Tomohiko Sagae // DSPS 1 [HueHelix]</li>\n<li>Perc // Take Your Body Off [Perc Trax]</li>\n<li>D.

Recently the techno oriented sub-label of Safari Electronique has added one more to their books - Finnish producer Samuli Kemppi, delivering a four-track rhythmic exploration, entitled ‘Binary System’. Having been a strong supporter of Kemppi’s music for a while now, it seemed about time to put some words on one of his releases.</p>\n<p>Churning, mechanical synths open ‘Resonant Object’, a track aptly titled with its ringing, metallic riff - a component which feels as if it could be part of a larger melodic line sharply regimented by Kemppi’s dizzying, loop-based rhythms. ’Almost Certain’ maintains this inhuman machine-driven feel - propelled by a sharp, discordant hook calling to mind the productions of Rod or Terence Fixmer.</p>\n<p>'Absolute Value' moves into faster, more dancefloor friendly territory, led by pounding kicks and disorientating melodies apt for early-hours sessions.</p>\n<p>The final offering comes in the form of ‘Libration’, a cut released exclusively for the vinyl version of the EP, providing a solid reason for purchasing physically. Dark, foreboding atmospheres prevail throughout, stunted high-end battling against Kemppi’s formidable wall of rumbling low-end.</p>\n<p>Children of Tomorrow’s releases have consistently managed to meet the blueprint for quality, after-hours techno, Kemppi’s release more than meeting the label’s high standards.

The third offering in the digital run comes from Taiwanese sound artist Lucia H Chung. Having released largely via the collaborative Mimosa Moize project, Chung here operates solo under a new production alias, en creux, which in French translates as 'in the gap', or 'negative space'.</p>\n<p>Both ‘Default 0003’s tracks posses a cold, automated feel - as if soundtracking the methodical calculations of an alien spacecraft. ‘Before’ in particular is reminiscent of Alva Noto’s _Module _release with its bitingly clean percussion and silken low-end drones, creeping in and out of focus like some unknown creature gliding across the dark ocean floor.</p>\n<p>The repetitious nature of the release makes it easy to slip into a meditative state; both tracks occupy around ten minutes and feature only subtle changes, their foundational elements remaining constant throughout. The restless ‘Between’ for example is built around buzzing phone lines ringing across the stereo-field, whilst faintly percussive atmospherics patiently build in pace and intensity.</p>\n<p>With rhythm and repetition being at the centre of Chung’s en creux project, it’s little wonder Default 0003 has found such a fitting home at SM-LL - a project surely set to see some exciting developments over 2014.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/135929583&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

The debut LP from founders Shapednoise &amp; Violet Poison (Violetshaped) presented a dark foreboding listening experience, as did the equally chilling selection of remixes released subsequently. Their latest offering, the intriguingly titled ‘Sulla Giostra Nell’Ombra’ EP, it appears should be approached no differently; a fact evident even simply following a cursory glance at the various artists named on its tracklist.</p>\n<p>The first offering comes from a new collaborative project, ‘Ontario Hospital’. Made up of Canadian producer’s Richard Oddie (Orphx) &amp; Dave Foster (Teste), their track entitled ‘Delirium Tremens’ shudders into life with quaking low-end, heavy blasts of concrete noise smashing through the mix. Following its first minute or so there is little change to the tracks foundations; its elements are instead processed, warped and mangled with various effects, individually bringing different elements in and out of focus.</p>\n<p>Irish producer &amp; She Works affiliate Sunil Sharpe follows with ‘Ground Skull Dust’ the track’s almost absurdly gothic title is infact rather fitting description for the crushing, gravelly percussion and clanging, discordant melody with which it is comprised.</p>\n<p>To call third track, ‘Function’ unconventional would be something of an understatement. Produced by Stray Landings’ favourite Serbian techno duo Ontal, the track was one I had picked to watch out for on the tracklist, and it certainly doesn’t disappoint. The pair’s tasteful pulses of vapourous sound-design are quickly shunted to the background by eardrum shattering thrusts of dense noise, maintained with fierce consistency - as if Ontal were maniacally attempting to drill to the earth’s core. As the track progresses it slowly builds to a climax, thundering noise eventually seeming to break through, only for the cycle to begin once again.</p>\n<p>The final track also see’s the introduction of a new project; Berlin’s Ascion here operating as CSA to provide an ambient closer. Despite the track’s beatlessness it still maintains the unsettling industrial tone of the rest of the release. Wailing harmonics and glide alongside CSA’s melancholy drones, like the distant echoes of a shuttle long lost in the vastness of space.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/128330458&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

With his Uranus label project having been a remarkable success given its low-key publicity campaign over 2013, Wadsworth has returned to previous home Hypercolour for this release, yet the hallmarks of his solo project have definitely left their mark. _S_panning ten tracks of sleazy mediations between house &amp; techno, the record is instantly recognisable as Wadsworth by the squelching acid basslines, and raw, muscular rhythms which provided the blueprint for the three Uranus releases so far.</p>\n<p>The crossover is perhaps most evident on ‘Hot Karl’, its languid, slurring bassline supported by booming 4/4 drums and dust-laden high-end percussion. Following track ‘Cock Soup’ follows a similar format, sauntering rhythms interlocked in a hazy sway with Wadsworth’s throbbing buzz of low-end.</p>\n<p>Whilst these and tracks such as ‘Evolove’ or the croaking, dub-tinged ’Verhexen’ feel dream-like with their lethargic pace and dense misty textures, Wadsworth manages to explore a range of themes without deviating from the format of groove-laden house drums and warped 303 synth-work. ‘Neo Nasty’ for example puts an electro edge on the sound; a kaleidoscope of twisting melodies and buoyant stuttered percussion call to mind some of Murk’s early productions.</p>\n<p>Where ‘Neo Nasty’ propels itself into space with its psychedelic hook, ‘Public Relations’ brings you back to earth with a resounding thump. Booming kicks plod forward whilst a gravelly vocal drawls ‘he’s so kind, he’s so gentle’ above a contorted bass which is neither of those things. It’s tracks like this where Wadsworth is arguably most in his element; the combination of his partly rugged, partly playful idiosyncrasies is nothing short of infectious.</p>\n<p>_Popularity _manages to mark a pivotal point in Wadsworth’s career rather succinctly whilst managing to have plenty of fun along the way; as mentioned previously the traits of his Uranus project have left a defining stamp on the album, yet with the slightly freer format of a full length release, Wadsworth is here able to indulge a side of his productions rarely showcased.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/19329719&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.fabriclondon.com/\">Fabric</a>\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> CD/Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 20/01/14</p>\n<p>Unlike many mixes there is no preamble to Pangaea’s Fabriclive.73; the moment I press play I’m thrust into the theme which overrides its entirety; interesting and considered techno. Things are softened up a bit, yet only partially with tracks by Lee Gamble and Shifted, until Manni Dee’s ‘Romantic Self’ propels forward with a buoyancy that anyone who has ever attempted to submerge a football in a swimming pool will be familiar with.</p>\n<p>Following this, Pangaea embarks on a persistently heart-racing series of mixes which are both inventive and impeccably paced. This section culminates with Mumdance &amp; MAO’s, ‘Truth’, an attention grabbing track which leaves you trying to guess what will come next. Here the mixes seem to slacken off a little, the selection doesn’t seem as considered as the previous ones. The good news is that this interval doesn’t last for long and I’m forced to retrieve my iPod (other mp3 players are available) from my pocket in order to check what track has led out of Peverelist &amp; Kowton’s ‘End Point’. Looking down at the screen, I read the words Forward Strategy Group, ‘Clean Neckline.’</p>\n<p>The selection from here on is pretty faultless - the Exposure remix of Speedy J’s ‘Something For Your Mind’ being a personal highlight for me. The following final mixes represent a breadth of techno, blended with unusual ease which leaves the listener feeling as if they have experienced far more than the tracklist can reveal.</p>\n<p>The series of Hessle Audio Fabric mixes seems complete with Pangaea’s contribution, being the final founder to do so. This is the least diverse of them all, yet should not be over looked for that. It maintains a focus throughout and presents us with an exploration of where Pangaea’s style and tastes lie at the moment, which seems a long way from the early Hemlock releases which first grabbed my attention some years ago.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/84056290?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=772c8b\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.randsrecords.com/releases/containing-a-thousand\">R&amp;S</a>\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> 12”/Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 03/03/14</p>\n<p>Having been sufficiently blown away by their release on Stroboscopic Artefact’s Monad series last year, Lakker have returned with what could be their strongest EP to date. The Dublin-based duo - consisting of Dara Smith and Ian McDonnell (Eomac)- focus their sound on rich dubstep-inspired atmospheres with a keen ear for delicate melodies and intricate motifs that go a long way.</p>\n<p>This EP is no exception, ‘Containing A Thousand’ features some familiar Pangaea-style clicks and shuffles, carrying the dense cloud of vocal textures and ambience. Behind this, a carefully executed backdrop of noise, which propels the whole thing forward and provides a nostalgic mid-00s London sound.</p>\n<p>‘Mausoleum’ is somewhat more of a trip; gravely samples are placed in abstract formation amidst spin-chilling crows and monstrously dark thuds. The track sounds like walking through a metallic jungle, forms of teeming wildlife are all around, yet they possess a morbid sense of lifelessness.</p>\n<p>However, it’s ‘K’antu’ that really steals the show for me, with its spiralling labyrinth of arpeggios and complex rhythmic network. The tension builds ceaselessly, clearing room only momentarily before clicking back again into action. It’s masterfully put together, and marries the quintessentially 90’s sound of artists like Aphex Twin, with an unmistakably modern production.</p>\n<p>The EP closes with ‘Thermohaline’, a no-nonsense 6am thumper that almost verges on grime, with its stark simplicity and bold dynamic structure. Again, Lakker show us how easy it is for them to employ their signature interplay of unapologetic subs and frail yet beautiful harmonies. There’s no doubt that this EP is going to sound especially good on vinyl, and stay with me throughout 2014.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/132203712&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.dement3d.fr/\">Dement3d Records</a>\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> Limited 12”\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 17/03/14</p>\n<p>You’d be forgiven for not knowing elusive outfit Dscrd (pronounced ‘discordance’). The group is formed of five producers from Paris who keep their media presence to a minimum, despite having featured on Stroboscopic Artefact’s legenday Monad Series. Nevertheless, their latest EP is nothing short of brilliant, littered with a myriad of intriguing moods and ideas, executed with phenomenal production.</p>\n<p>The EP opens in a brash and audacious manner – fusing the inventive use of fuzzed-out NIN guitars with the pounding sub-noise that dscrd are best known for. ‘Watch and Punish’ has a distinctly live sound that a lot of music of this kind lacks – it’s easy to hear each respective musician’s part develop, giving the sound a much needed animated feel.</p>\n<p>‘Second Zone’ pushes the sound even further, shuffling sporadically between twitchy spasms of percussion and mind-bending digital feedback. Fresh rhythmic patterns continually reappear from nowhere, but vanish again into the bustling noisy backdrop. The hectic convulsions and tremors are reminiscent of some abstract forms of neurofunk and techstep; textures shape-shift at such a breakneck speed that you wonder if you heard them at all.</p>\n<p>However, ‘L’Etale’ stands out as a clear favorite; the arrangement is so restrained and sparse that it almost sounds like a stock recording of a computer idly humming to itself. But listen a little a closer and you hear elements of dub, industrial, glitch, techno and drone all showing their bones as the track unfolds. The artificial purr that underpins the piece eventually reaches a level of complete articulation, filling every iota of possible headspace before sneaking back off into the cold shadows.</p>\n<p>‘Austeria’ closes the EP with a twisted, earthy dub, which occasionally skulks out of view until almost completely hidden. But ultimately, no one can hide for long in the panopticon, and any semblance of optimism has all the life squeezed out of it by one final surge of static.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/137679169&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Their YouTube channel is a treasure trove of smushed together 90’s signifiers – all dance workout videos, N64 graphics and spliff-rolling mickey-mouse hands. DJ Haus’ label gobbles up everything it can find and spits it out an alarming rate; alarming, not because of the speed of the turnover, but because DJ Haus clearly has such a keen knack for unearthing artists sharing his own irreverent attitude. Talented revivalists with fresh perspective, unafraid to dust off and reassemble genres long thought stale – DJ Q’s brightly coloured speed garage; Murlo’s Nickelodeon-via-Mozart dancehall &amp; grime; spaced out intergalactic house wayfarer Legowelt and UR’s own Detroit-electro assassin DJ Stingray to name a few. The resulting music is often as disorienting as the labels media approach – and equally as often it hits that sweet spot between body moving and brain melting.</p>\n<p>Irish producer Eomac - one half of excellent cerebral Techno duo Lakker, and here working as EeOo, announces his induction to UTTU’s ranks in fine style. Taking all the ingredients of your standard 90’s breakbeat rave cookbook – but crucially misremembering the actual cooking instructions, the Workout EP serves up a dish that’s as messy as it is delicious. The tracks bulge under the weight of recycled Beltram hoovers &amp; yo-yoing Sawtooth glissando, with any remaining frequency gaps shored up by white noise percussion. The approach is maximalist in the extreme: every musical layer appears to be locked in a death-struggle with its immediate neighbour. It takes a lot of chops to be able to pull off this approach and not have the whole thing crumbling under its own weight – perhaps it is the subtle detail that is also present – for instance the morphing nature of the parts or the tiny individual sounds which add character and depth.</p>\n<p>There are touchstones; but they are exactly that – jumping off points to propel the tracks into ever-greater rhythmic contortions and darker moods. For instance the middle section of ‘Calc’ references that moody, super-swung fast-garage/dubstep aesthetic of the early Hessle releases; the Zomby-esque drunk synth-blip arpeggios on ‘We Are All The Same’s; ‘Battery Baby’ with its demented growling electro bassline and relatively straightforward house beat completely at odds with the madness swirling all around it. Perhaps the freshest track on the EP is ‘Workout’ – mashing up a slow jersey club beat with oddly funky splashes of white noise, moody chromatic bleeps, a tunnelling, oscillating bassline, and (of course) plastic cowbell: it really feels like nothing else. At times the intensity of the noise makes the track hard to listen to – I’ve no idea how well something so boldly noisy might go down in a club – but maybe that’s missing the point. Taken as a whole, the Workout EP sees Eomac cutting loose and engaging his creative process with a delightfully flippant brashness – exorcising the ‘serious’ Techno and exploring new combinations of dance signifiers in a stylistically exciting way.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/23035754&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Whilst he has become best known for a thunderous brand of industrial techno evident on numerous of his records, a look at Wells’ varied release history reveals contrasts; the fogged-out piano musings of a track like ‘Before I Go’ is a fair distance from the pounding, no frills warehouse techno of his EP for Hans Bouffmyhre’s Sleaze Records.</p>\n<p>Another manifestation of this tension can be found in the two labels Wells has set up alongside his main imprint Perc Trax. Where the Submit imprint, opened with four uncompromising Einsturzende Neubauten reinterpretations, followed by Feral Grind, a compilation mediating between techno and noise; the aim of his second sub-label Perc Trax LTD, is unapologetically dancefloor centric. His recent second album, <em>The Power &amp; The Glory</em> is arguably further proof of this conflict, and in my opinion, all the more interesting for it.</p>\n<p>Wells’ debut album <em>Wicker &amp; Steel</em> was a whirring cacophony of mechanical techno; but vivid melodic themes and a mangled use of vocals make <em>The Power &amp; The Glory</em> feel significantly more dynamic than you would usually expect from a full-length produced by an artist known for techno, putting the LP more in line with the work of Throbbing Gristle or Neubauten than anything else.</p>\n<p>Opening track ‘Rotting Sound’ makes a fitting example of this; macabre, Clockwork Orange style synths are interspersed with dalek outcries courtesy of Dethscalator’s Dan Chandler, intermittently breaking through the bed of distorted radio static at the track’s foundations. More interesting perhaps is the spoken-word which begins the track. Taken from a Mike Patton interview the quote introduces the album discussing the idea of using sounds which transpire accidentally or unexpectedly leaving you with ‘this rotten sound that doesn’t belong there’. The soundbite sets a fitting tone for a record which seems in the process of malfunctioning even whilst you listen.</p>\n<p>Even those tracks aimed towards club play feature sounds distorted to the point where they feel verging on destruction - straining themselves to the limit. As the leading single, ‘Take Your Body Off’ is strong testimony to this, screeching kicks and clattering percussion are broken once again by the nauseating screams of Dan Chandler, in what feels like an exercise in seeing what Wells can get away with whilst still sneaking the record into DJ’s gigging bags.</p>\n<p><em>The Power &amp; The Glory</em> helps present a well-rounded image of Wells’ past influences; amidst the obvious techno and industrial sounds aforementioned, the aptly titled ‘Galloper’ recalls the sound of early D&amp;B scenes with its jolting breakbeats and discordant rave synths. There is a similar rave heritage to ‘Dumpster’, here the chiming stabs instead call to mind the breakneck warehouse sounds of early UK techno, promoted by James Ruskin and the like.</p>\n<p>There have been several full-lengths released by techno affiliated artists in the last few months in what is an undoubtedly fruitful period. The success and uniqueness of <em>The Power &amp; The Glory</em> however, comes from the fact that Wells manages to take a step back from one defining sound (at least as far as genres go) instead presenting an album touched by various strands of electronic music offering an album rich in ideas, making a longer sustained experience than your usual techno-with-a-few-ambient-interludes LP.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/129717803&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Perhaps better known as Audio Injection or Truncate, the output of David Flores has been nothing short of staggering in recent years. Despite three years since its release, his ‘Concentrate/Focus’ EP can still be heard quaking dance floors at 6am, but tracks like ‘Dial’ and the more recent ‘Breakdown’ on 50weapons have showcased his ability to sonically experiment outside the bracket of what he describes as ‘just DJ tools’.</p>\n<p>Ahead of his show at Fabric on the 22nd alongside Ben Sims and Steffi, we caught up with Flores to talk about London, independent labels, and Flying Lotus.</p>\n<p><strong>So you’ve just released your brilliant EP, ‘Pressurize’ on 50Weapons. How did your involvement with the label come about?</strong></p>\n<p>You know, Modeselektor hit me up on Twitter and was like “hey man, I love your tracks, I wanna talk to you” and we had a little back and forth and eventually he said “hey you wanna do an EP on 50Weapons?” and I was blown away.</p>\n<p><strong>It sounds a lot more boundary pushing than the usual Truncate releases. Was this intentional?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah. I wanted to try something different, and Modeselektor wanted me to try something different. He was like “I want you to kind of step out of your comfort zone and do some broken stuff”. He was like “I know you got it in you, I know you can do it” so that was pretty cool.</p>\n<p><strong>So have you been listening to a lot of music outside the realms of techno recently?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah I’ve been listening to a lot of Flying Lotus and that kind of stuff, where the tempos are a lot slower, and you have all this off beat percussion and heavy kicks drums – that’s been a real influence on these tracks.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think this is the start of a new direction for your Truncate releases?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m still doing the DJ tools, because that’s what I like to do. I have a lot of tracks that I’m experimenting with that are broken beat and are a similar vibe to the 50Weapons release, but I want to perfect it and get some really good stuff together before I start putting more tracks out that are like that. It’s definitely not going to be like the last EP.</p>\n<p><strong>So what spurred the creation of the Truncate moniker in the first place?</strong></p>\n<p>I wanted to go back to my roots with techno and house sounds with influence from Chicago and Detroit. I just wanted to keep tracks simple and not too complicated, and I DJ on Traktor so I like playing loops and parts, so that was another thing; it was a DJ mentality versus… writing ‘tracks’, you know?</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think you’re going more in that direction now? More club-oriented?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah I think so. Besides trying the new broken beat stuff, the 4/4 stuff is taking over, even my Audio Injection stuff is starting to sound more like Truncate now. That’s just the vibe that I feel right now.</p>\n<p><strong>You’ve done some pretty amazing remixes as well, a favourite of mine being that of Roman Poncet</strong>**<em>.</em>**** How did that come about?**</p>\n<p>Len Faki just contacted me and said ‘hey man I’ve got these tracks from this new guy and I’d really like some remixes from you’. It was supposed to be one remix but I kept going with the sounds and a whole EP came out which is pretty cool.</p>\n<p><strong>Have you got any remixes lined up for the future?</strong></p>\n<p>When I’m not traveling I’m always in the studio doing remixes. I have some stuff coming on Sinewave for Damon Wad’s label, I even have a remix coming out on my own label, Truncate, which is a remix of my old ‘Concentrate’ track with remixes from Mark Broom and Ben Sims so I’m still pretty active with the whole remix thing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3721/13133350184_fc44678d65_n.jpg\" alt=\"Truncate II\"></p>\n<p><strong>Do you have something of an ethos for your own label? Is there an intentional ‘sound’ to your label that you keep separate from other releases?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah it’s basically just a medium for my own tracks, which are just like DJ Tools. That’s the whole reason I started the label – to have these tools on wax basically. I’m kind of keeping it the same all the way through – even with the remixes, I don’t want any crazy complicated tracks, I just want some good club tracks. For now. (laughs).</p>\n<p><strong>These days it seems like every producer wants to start up their own label to release their own music if they have enough money to do so. Why do you think that this is? What is the appeal for you of owning your own label?</strong></p>\n<p>I guess because you don’t have to deal with sending tracks to this A&amp;R guy saying “no we don’t like this, we don’t like that, we’ll take one track out these ten you sent me”. When you have your own label, you have control of whatever comes out – if you feel comfortable with these four tracks that you wrote, then bam you can put them out - and hopefully you’ll get a good response.</p>\n<p><strong>So you’d definitely say you prefer self-releasing than releasing with an external label?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah. I mean I can write five tracks and send them to a label and the label will be like “we’ll take these two” and I’ll be like “well all these tracks kind of go together” but “no – we’re not feeling those”. Where as if it’s my own label if I want to put all these tracks out at the same time I can do it. It’s just more control – I think that’s what it is.</p>\n<p><strong>What can you tell us about the scene in California? Obviously you have Developer and Drumcell but are there any other people around at the moment you could tell us about?</strong></p>\n<p>Well alongside Drumcell &amp; Developer, Silent Servant is out here in L.A who pretty much everybody knows. The duo Raíz who are also part of the Droid guys as well. You have these kids that are throwing parties in L.A here now called ‘Involve’ – yeah there’s a bit of a scene here in L.A. It’s not as crazy as Europe obviously but we have shows pretty consistently and we get as many big artists as we can out here (when we can). Drumcell &amp; Raíz are always on tour but whenever we can put a show together it happens.</p>\n<p><strong>Does it seem to be growing?</strong></p>\n<p>T: Definitely, I’d say within the last two years it’s been growing. I mean these kids from Involve they’re starting to do shows now where basically before it was the Droid Behaviour crew throwing all the techno shows and now these kids are coming up and they’re starting to bring artists out as well. So it’s pretty cool to see someone else taking the initiative.</p>\n<p><strong>And cool to have you guys coming over to London as well! Obviously you’re playing Fabric on the 22</strong><span class=\"s1\"><strong><sup>nd</sup></strong></span><strong>, have you played there before?</strong>\nT: Yeah this will be my second time.</p>\n<p><strong>Would you say you have a history with London itself? What was it like last time you played?</strong></p>\n<p>Last time I played it was for Ben Klock’s Fabric mix release party - I loved it man. The soundsystem was amazing, and the crowd were pretty crazy. I find the London crowd really cool, I like them. That gig was actually my second gig in London so it was pretty good for my second gig there to be at Fabric.</p>\n<p><strong>In what way would you say the crowd here differs from other European or American cities?</strong></p>\n<p>T: I guess in London they like the harder music, so you can kind of go as hard as you want – they just want you to bring it.</p>\n<p><strong>Lastly is there anything you can tell us about your future projects for this year, and what you’re up to more generally?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m definitely doing a lot more Truncate stuff this year. I got remix EPs coming out, the next one like I say is coming out with Mark Broom &amp; Ben Sims. Hopefully I’ll be working on another EP for 50Weapons although it probably won’t come out his year, but maybe early next year. I’m doing some little side things as well - I don’t really want to mention them yet but yeah, busy in the studio and touring a lot!<br/><br/>Interview by George McVicar</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/139106533&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

His productions seem to straddle two modes of thought; in part they are clean, mechanical and ruthlessly precise, yet on the other hand they are often noisey, industrial tinged affairs with little concern for how friendly a sound is on the ear. His latest release for Sverca’s Semantica Records continues to balance these two approaches, providing four freeform experiments in rhythmic noise.</p>\n<p>The way this is carried off here calls to mind Autechre records such as <em>Oversteps</em> or <em>LP5</em>, as Mey keeps his track’s from stalling with a constant stream of variations in rhythm and timbre. Opener ’Disperse’ makes a good example of this; fractured bursts of humming static are placed astride an unremitting pulse of filtered snares and jolting low-end.</p>\n<p>Despite their abstract qualities Mey’s offerings often possess an underlying groove that feels more akin to traditional techno. The swaying ‘Slew Modified’ demonstrates this well; for all its frosty Alva Noto style alienness it’s the track’s gently bubbling riff which ultimately sets the track’s tone. The same can be said of third track ’Double Slit’. Modulating white noise scuttles around a swarming electrical buzz yet these elements feel peripheral to the robust dub-techno march at the track’s core.</p>\n<p>Blackened, swamp-like textures are also constant throughout the release, yet perhaps most evident on closing track ‘Excursions To Intersections’. A slurry of fizzing chemical noise clouds the listeners headspace, warbling synthesisers snaking in and out. The track also makes a good example of Mey’s ability to slowly build tension in his tracks - over its eight minute duration the layers slowly interlink and blur with one another building to a steady crescendo.</p>\n<p>Semantica has provided a fitting home for artists working at the more experimental end of the techno spectrum to indulge their more abstract tendencies since its founding in 2006 - Mey’s brooding, sound-design heavy signature making a well-placed addition.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/18846269&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>“Honestly I’m not so much into this Berlin thing even though I definitely understand how nice it is to live in a city that’s a big meeting point for Techno producers” Sylvain Le Goff, better known as Octave divulges when asked about the pull of the city, which appears to draw in techno producers from around the world with gravitational force. “You can see techno ‘colleagues’ all the time, have good fun making music, try new gear or just hang out with guys that have the same passion and meet a lot of people. I don’t know - I’m just not interested I guess. It feels like too much hype, and the city is overpopulated with DJs which is not something I’m looking for.”</p>\n<p>Having been born and raised a Parisian, it’s refreshing to hear the producer talk about his home city with such enthusiasm. “I love the city, I have my family and friends here and have never thought about leaving. Even more since it’s very easy to travel from Paris, by train or plane which is cool for touring.”</p>\n<p>First entering the world of production in 2007, it wasn’t long before the Octave project began to gather momentum - Richie Hawtin featuring ‘Past Flash’ on his 2008 released ‘Sounds From Can Elles’ CD for DJ Magazine. However arguably the most pivotal point in Le Goff’s career came with the establishment of his own label, Silent Steps. “I love techno and I love working with other people from the scene, but something I really need to work with people is the feeling” Le Goff says of the family oriented vibe to the label. “All my collaborations are based on the music of course, but the feeling you have with the person is something really important to me as well. I need both and I think that rules the way I work with the agency/label.”</p>\n<p>Whatever the reasons behind Le Goff’s approach to running the label, its release history is testament to its success, having put out music from the likes of Audio Injection, Yan Cook and Impact Unit. The label has also seen several high profile artists take up remixes for the label, including London based Ali Wells aka Perc. “He did a remix for Silent Steps two years ago which was actually the first reason why we were in touch. It was a true honour for me and the label, this remix is still one of the tracks I like most on Silent Steps” Le Goff explains of his relationship with the Perc Trax founder. “After that I booked him three times at label nights in Germany so those were good opportunities to meet and get to know each other. He’s a true guy; easy and very nice. We have a nice, friendly relationship but I think I’m still, foremost, a big fan.”</p>\n<p>With 2014 christened by the release of an EP Analogue Series remixes from the likes of Milton Bradley, Bas Mooy, Giorgio Gigli and Yan Cook, the rest of the year is set to be a busy one for the label. “I have a busy schedule of releases, all on vinyl, featuring amazing tracks and remixes from Impact Unit (Material Object + Luis Flores), The Noisemaker, Paul Birken, Subjected, DJ Hyperactive, Yan Cook, Mike Parker and many others, so you can expect a lot of music to come out in the next months. The agency ‘Silent Steps Booking’ will take up a lot of time this year as I really want to grow it and promote all six artists with me on the roster. It’s very important to me and I will dedicate time to it.”</p>\n<p>Le Goff’s offering to our podcast series consists of a live mix recorded at Crucifix Lane towards the end of last year. “My live sets are always thought out and worked on a lot at the studio, but I also always leave room to jam and go on unplanned paths to keep it live and have more fun.”</p>\n<p>No tracklist available.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/stray-landings-mix-series/id556425050?mt=2\">Subscribe in iTunes</a></p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"60\" src=\"//www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?feed=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0027-octave-live-at-crucifix-lane%2F&amp;mini=1&amp;embed_uuid=8a1f4acb-3c02-4ea4-ba82-2eecdcf8d0ee&amp;replace=0&amp;hide_cover=1&amp;hide_artwork=1&amp;embed_type=widget_standard&amp;hide_tracklist=1\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/0027-octave-live-at-crucifix-lane/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=resource_link\">0027 // Octave [Live at Crucifix Lane]</a> by <a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=profile_link\">Stray Landings</a> on <a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=homepage_link\"> Mixcloud</a></p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Trigger Warning: Sexual Harassment</p>\n<p>Safe spaces are not new for club culture. Historically, they have often developed not only as a way to protect musical cultures, but also as a way to protect individuals who may face harassment on the basis of their gender, sexuality or ethnicity. This developed throughout the LGBTQ scene from the disco and house days – with clubs such as Paradise Garage and The Loft – through to the present day. LGBTQ people recognized as a necessity the need to create a ‘safe space’ to express themselves beyond the restraints of wider society - be that in clubs or beyond. This is an essential practice, with Berghain’s previous incarnation as ‘Snax’ and later ‘Osgut’ being a notable example of tolerant intra-club politics. This is important because the intersectional nature of those clubs was a key function of the music, perpetuating a dynamic and inclusive dance floor that enabled a fluid dialogue between people, rather than relegating the clubs to a heteronormative sphere. However, with the growing presence of ‘lad culture’ in modern clubs, many venues often fall short of these ideals while professing to be part of a similar process. This has had dramatic social, sexual and economic implications for clubs, as Julia Gray (co-director of Hollaback London) writes, “so many women and LGBTQ people submit stories of harassment and even assault in clubs and pubs to our website; and these experiences are now so commonplace that they’re actually putting people off going out altogether.” Thankfully, ‘Good Night Out’, the first ever London-wide campaign to end sexual harassment in clubs, has been working to return the idea of ‘safe spaces’ to the public lexicon, and has been instrumental in reintroducing this crucial concept. We spoke to Julia Gray earlier this week to talk about the project and its relation to the clubs that we love so dearly.</p>\n<p><strong>So for those who don’t know, what is ‘Good Night Out’ and how did it start?</strong></p>\n<p>Good Night Out is a campaign set up to work with clubs, bars and pubs to tackle harassment on nights out. We decided to run this campaign as we’ve been running an anti-street harassment campaign called Hollaback London for four years. We provide a website for people who have experienced harassment, be that sexual or otherwise, in public spaces across London, to share their stories and find some support and solidarity, and we wanted to extend this to an establishment-specific campaign. We want people to know they can report harassment that happens to them, and we want to make sure venues are doing the best they can for their customers. So a couple of key points about the campaign; first of all, we want it to be really positive. It’s not about scaring people or saying bad things happen in certain venues, it’s about making sure everyone has a good time, hence the name Good Night Out!  The other key aspect is working really closely with the venues. It’s not just about paying lip-service to the campaign by putting up posters etc, it’s about working with us directly to make sure their policy is right-on, and sharing best practices.</p>\n<p><strong>So how do the mechanics of it work? How do you work to promote safe spaces?</strong></p>\n<p>We came up with a pledge for the campaign which reads: ‘If something or someone makes you feel uncomfortable, no matter how small it seems, you can report it to any member of our staff and they will work with you to make sure it doesn’t have to ruin your night.’  So first we have a bit of a dialogue with the venues, and talk about the policies they already have in place, and we build in our campaign pledge into their harassment policy. For us, it’s about what the person who has been harassed wants to happen. It’s not about chucking everybody out, or getting the two people in the same room and hashing it out, it’s about finding out what that person wants, making sure they feel safe, and working with them to make sure they don’t have their night ruined. So we work on policy with the venue, and then they officially endorse it by letting us publish their name on our website. We offer briefings to staff if they want it, and then we supply them with a training info pack and the campaign posters for display in the venue, which states the pledge and gives information about the campaign.</p>\n<p><strong>Which clubs are you currently working with?</strong></p>\n<p>So far, we’ve got Fabric, Ministry of Sound, Village Underground, Dalston bars Dance Tunnel, Dalston Superstore, Voodoo Rays, The Alibi, Shacklewell Arms, Birthdays, The Old Blue Last and we’ve got a few more Hackney places getting on board; The Oval Space, and a brand new venue called Shapes. We’re planning to continue reaching out to more and more venues and ask them to come on board, and we’re hoping to get it rolled out across London and eventually across the UK. We’ve had similar campaign groups from other cities get in touch and ask advice, which is great.</p>\n<p><strong>Seems pretty amazing how quickly it’s grown, have you been surprised by the response?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah we were surprised. We were apprehensive about how the venues would respond, we didn’t want them to think we were suggesting anything negative about their space, but because we work a lot with Kirsti [Fabric], she advised us on how to and frame it as something really positive, and that’s worked really well, we’re just promoting the idea of everyone having a good time, and it remains about the music and having fun. It’s been amazing how supportive everyone has been, because it’s not just a case of saying ‘OK we’ll put the posters up’, most of the clubs have been really proactive and they’ve wanted us to talk to come in and talk to their staff, and have been really helpful with promoting the campaign.</p>\n<p>** I understand there is a similar project in Washington D.C, ‘Safe Bars’ - are the projects related?**</p>\n<p>The one in Washington is not related but we had heard about that and taken a bit of influence from similar projects; there’s another one is Baltimore and a few others. It was good to hear that other services like this were happening, and we took inspiration from that, and adapted it to the London scene.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think this is a problem in all clubs, or is the problem evident in some clubs more than others?</strong></p>\n<p>For the bigger clubs, it’s probably a bit more of a problem because it’s easier to be ‘anonymous’, but to be honest, it’s pretty widespread, and harassment occurs in almost all clubs across the board.</p>\n<p><strong>Where are you hoping to take this campaign in the future?</strong></p>\n<p>Hollaback is an umbrella project, we run the London chapter but there are others in the UK and so we are hoping to work with those sites to role Good Night Out across the UK.</p>\n<p>**Lastly, how can people get in touch if they want to get involved or if they have experienced harassment in a club themselves? **</p>\n<p>As part of Good Night Out we’re running a Twitter campaign with the hashtag #goodnightout and we’re really encouraging people to tweet @HollabackLDN about their experiences whether good or bad. If we hear about experiences in a club that haven’t been dealt with properly, we’ll be able to contact them and try to get them on board. If there’s a club, bar, pub or any venue that want to be part of the campaign, they can tweet us or email us at London@ihollaback.org and we’re welcoming suggestions for any potential signatories to the campaign pledge.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/13287350705/\" title=\"748bf157-e047-4298-b458-3c7628bca400_zpsc0d8676e by straylandings, on Flickr\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"748bf157-e047-4298-b458-3c7628bca400_zpsc0d8676e\" height=\"906\" src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7099/13287350705_8effbc4180_b.jpg\" width=\"1005\"/></a></p>\n",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.vladislavdelay.com/site/projects/label/\">Ripatti</a>\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> Limited 12”\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 17/03/14</p>\n<p>The number of artists setting up labels dedicated to servicing their own material seems to have risen significantly in recent years. For Finnish producer Sasu Ripatti aka Vladislav Delay (and countless other alias’) this may have come at a certain price, namely the added stress of having to deal with the often unreliable manufacturing process. For the most part though, the establishment of his ‘Ripatti’ imprint has been an excellent move, affording him the creative freedom to explore some of his most experimental ideas to date, and this is saying something given how abstract some of his previous releases have been.</p>\n<p>The latest 12” in the vinyl-only series, ‘Ripatti03’, comprises the first offering on the label under Ripatti’s possibly best known alias, Vladislav Delay. The style of both tracks included is reminiscent of his <em>Vantaa</em> and _Kuopio _albums, yet it seems defined in more forceful terms here, wild, off-grid polyrhythms in central focus.</p>\n<p>A-side ‘#5’ sees muffled vocals fighting against Ripatti’s mess of fractured ambience, sounding like a Tim Hecker track processed through a series of severe noise gates, tremolos and delays. As the track transitions between sections around the midway mark, this harsh processing subsides temporarily, revealing shivering swathes of synthesiser, before abruptly launching back into a stuttered frenzy of footwork drums and jolting, fuzz-laden samples.</p>\n<p>On the flip, ‘#22’ takes a sharper, less dense approach without loosing any of the a-side’s maniacal, off-kilter appeal. Vocals steadily rise in the track’s backdrop before being suppressed by anarchic drums, which seem to fill every available space. Ripatti once again leaves space to hint at a subdued foundation to ‘#22’. Shimmering samples chime above sparse, reverberating toms, before we are mercilessly flung back into the chaos once again.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"320\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/16983111&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> <a href=\"http://inarboretum.com/\">Aboretum</a>\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> 12”/Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 23/03/14</p>\n<p>Sound-designer is perhaps a more apt title than producer for Berlin based Giuseppe Bifulco, aka Drøp. His productions are constructed with a stunning level of attention to detail, keeping a constant stream of subtle variations throughout his tracks, giving them a depth and staying power often lacking amongst his contemporaries. His latest EP, ‘Vasundhara’, marks the first release on Aboretum; a 2012 founded project also based in Berlin, whose principle focus has been event hosting until now.</p>\n<p>The release is densely layered; thick, grinding bass, surges of sawmill noise and booming, apocalyptic hits common throughout. Given how compact and invasive the tracks can feel, Bifulco’s use of silence becomes all the more effective. ‘Epileptic Heritage’ works patiently into a solid march across three minutes, building up pulses of static and unsettling drones. A sudden, sharp cut to silence leaves the listener suspended in space for a moment, before ominous blasts of low-end aggressively thrust you back into consciousness.</p>\n<p>In other instances restraint is exercised differently. Shamanic drums build steadily across ‘Erratic Ritual’, filtered static contrasting with the track’s comparatively organic foundations. The same interplay between natural and synthesised, mechanical sounds runs through ‘Vasundhara’. Sharp glitches twitch around chilling atmospheres, like the dull humming of a decrepit freezer. Cutting through these is the regimented thud of skin-drums we have become accustomed to throughout the release.</p>\n<p>Closing the EP is a driving recast of ’Epileptic Heritage’ by Italian duo Dadub. The remix follows a more conventional path to the original, adhering to the signature sound Dadub have carefully refined for themselves. There are numerous traits shared between the two acts which is perhaps what makes the remix so well fitted; Dadub turning Bifulco’s oddball percussion into a faltering assembly of tribal polyryhthms beneath brooding, vapourous drones.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/72345338?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=772c8b\" width=\"640\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Whilst releases on Opal Tapes, Modal Analysis and the legendary Sandwell District, have undoubtedly expanded Yves De Mey’s radius of influence in the last few years, the Belgium producer has in fact had a rather substantial career prior to this. Having produced Drum &amp; Bass under the name Eavesdropper through the early 2000s, De Mey also has a long history working on sound for film and theatre projects.</p>\n<p>These days however, his solo works are increasingly avante-garde, rich, evolving soundscapes, and sparse, gritty percussion a common feature. Alongside this, De Mey also produces as Sendai with long-term friend Peter Van Hoesen. The project see’s the pair take a no compromise approach to production, scrapping any ideas which both producers aren’t fully sure of.</p>\n<p>With their latest LP, <em>A Smaller Divide</em>, released recently on the duo’s own ‘Archives Intérieures’ label, as well as a new solo EP entitled ‘Double Slit’ out via Semantica, we caught up with De Mey to talk discuss the recent projects, buying his first synthesiser, and the benefits of creative freedom.</p>\n<p><strong>Hi Yves, how are things?</strong></p>\n<p>Pretty good, a bit stressful this afternoon - I was making my schedule for the next coming months with all the studio work I have to do and things like that. There is way too much, at a certain point in my Google calendar there are three jobs at the same time which is impossible! We’ll be moving house in that same period so it’s going to be hectic for the next three to four months.</p>\n<p><strong>Better to be busy I guess! Are you touring much with the Sendai stuff?</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately not. It’s kind of weird because the Sendai album is out, but I have no idea about general reception to it. I hear from some people they really like it, other people say ‘wow this is heavy’, my girlfriend hates it - which is not too bad of course! So it’s weird and not many gigs announced – there’s one at the end of May at Nuits Sonores, which is a big festival and that’s basically it. Then for my solo stuff there is one in Paris in early May – that’s also about it! It’s alright though, it’s fun to play out but it also takes a lot of organization.</p>\n<p><strong>You play live with no laptop - just hardware right? I’m guessing that takes more organizing than just turning up with a bag of records.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, it’s pretty straight forward actually. When I started preparing my set I bought the gear to do the set. So everything grew together which means its not really stressful to do it now. It’s a bit more technical, but I feel much cooler doing it like this. The nicest thing about it is that I’m not watching a timeline anymore, I’m just listening to the sounds. Its pretty much laid out how I’m going to do my set, but I can play parts when I see there’s a good crowd reaction for instance, and I can stretch those parts and manipulate quite seriously. It’s nice, it allows me a lot of freedom and it’s really crash proof. The liberation from the screen is amazing.</p>\n<p><strong>When you’re producing is it a similar situation or is that more laptop based?</strong></p>\n<p>Actually, up until now it’s been more laptop based, but I always record long stretches of sound, like when I make a sound with my modular I do takes between fifteen and thirty minutes, then start editing afterwards. With the gear I’m using live I’m also thinking about a concept where I can go straight to hardware - maybe even making records without the computer. I’m not there yet because there’s a lot of stuff I love doing on the computer like pre-mastering. I’m a studio engineer anyway so for me, I’m trying to find the right balance between the two.</p>\n<p><strong>I put in my review that the ‘Double Slit’ EP reminded me of Autechre a bit – they’re really well known for having loads of variation, it’s kind of what defined them. I think it’s this method of working you mention that gives a similar, improvised quality.</strong></p>\n<p>That’s probably because I am recording these long stretches of sound with no loops. I’m just manipulating all the time, that’s the fun thing, I like the organic quality of it all. When I’m composing I find it really boring if I hear like eight or sixteen bars of the same thing. I also really like going into detail, for example making sure that each kick drum has a little variation in the EQ or whatever.</p>\n<p>I must admit it is something I started doing after an Autechre concert I went to. It was around the <em>Confield</em> time so it must have been 2001. During that live concert not a single drum sound was ever the same - I was so impressed by that.</p>\n<p><strong>Was that when you were making more of the D&amp;B style stuff?</strong></p>\n<p>That was probably around the end of my D&amp;B frenzy! The last D&amp;B thing I released was in 2000 or 2001. By then I was already getting more into the experimental stuff.</p>\n<p>Initially what attracted me to that was the same thing that attracts me to music nowadays – full on energy and bass, that’s it, not even necessarily rhythm. I love rhythm obviously but I prefer more like, the sound quality of the bass and sheer energy in a track. In the good days of D&amp;B it was  <em>there</em>, the first releases on Ram Records for instance were amazing.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s interesting you say that, a lot of reviews of your work talk about it in the context of dance music, querying whether it’s danceable, but as you say it’s more about the energy to it.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, you go through a mindset that you try to impose on other people - they can still do what they want with it but I’m not a dance floor type anyway. I hardly ever go out, I quickly get bored in a club… It’s not that I don’t like the music but I don’t care about hearing a four to the floor beat for five or six hours. I’m more of a stay at home producer, my take on electronic music is how I probably would love it to be in a club - then I’d probably go out again!</p>\n<p><strong>Did you go to Atonal last year? A lot of the people playing there sounded amazing in that space on such a good system, but most of it you wouldn’t class as straight dance floor - People like Russell Haswell and Vladislav Delay were playing.</strong></p>\n<p>A very good example of that as well are Emptyset. I mean that’s my kind of dance. I might start tapping my toe to it, but usually it just puts a big smile on my face. That’s what I want, I don’t have to dance, I can just be there in the sweet spot of the sound and let it come over me, that’s enough.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/91704666&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<p>I think the quality of all the producers we just mentioned is that they become the room, and the room becomes their sound and that’s what I really like about it. That’s also why I like playing live, you can go loud or whatever you want, there’s a few expectations but there’s no limits. You can go wild, not necessarily to torture people but it should be very physical I think – on the limit of torture maybe. On the other hand it’s a good way of showing your production skills, going loud but without doing any harm, its not <em>just</em> noise, it’s a way of delivering impact.</p>\n<p>It’s also why I always loved My Bloody Valentine, they’re probably one of the only guitar bands I really love, I’ve seen them quite a few times as well. The first time I saw them was in 1992 maybe. It was amazing this wall of sound, especially during the finale of their concert. Everybody would be smiling but also with their hands over their ears! You get the feeling like you are standing next to a jet fighter as it goes off.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of guitar bands… I’m not sure if I should ask you this as the chances are its a Discogs error, but you’re credited on an album by a group called Dildo Warheads?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh yeah I played the organ! Dildo Warheads was a bunch of old friends of mine, my contribution goes back to when we were sixteen or seventeen years old. We had different bands, at a certain point all these fell apart and Dildo Warheads rose up from the ashes. (Laughs) But we stayed in touch and they were like ‘yeah we need an organ come play with us’. Then just for the recordings I played like stupid sixties organ kind of thing – that was it.</p>\n<p><strong>Would you say playing in bands was your first step into music?</strong></p>\n<p>No, my first step into music was much earlier, I bought my first synthesizer at the age of twelve. I started experimenting, then when I was fourteen or fifteen I met a guy who was very much into experimental music, very Cold Wave-esque kind of stuff and that was the kind of music I was listening to as well at that time. We started playing together each school holiday - we started recording together on a four-track cassette. It was pretty rough, very dark, wild things with a synthesizer and an old drum-computer but without any ambition - just enjoying ourselves and having a good time in the studio. That was probably my first real experience doing music.</p>\n<p><strong>And what about the film and theatre stuff you’ve done? How did that come about?</strong></p>\n<p>Actually I studied film - well I tried to study film! I went to three different schools in Brussels and with each I did the first year. Pretty soon it was clear to me that I was paying more attention to the sound for the movie projects we had to do than the actual movie itself. After the third year of trial and error at school I decided to go to work, and found my way into the studio. I started off as a camera assistant, photographer and video editor.</p>\n<p>At a certain point someone was like ‘hey, you should do sound production as well’. The cool thing was that my boss in that studio said here’s a bunch of money, figure out a system that works for you and learn the trade’. So that was wicked, and so I started doing it.</p>\n<p>Then after five years working there I get an offer from a theatre company to make music for them. I told my boss I was quitting and going freelance, and that’s what I did because I knew I had six months of work at that theatre company. It’s really a very romantic story in a way because it’s how it’s supposed to go I think. I couldn’t study for it so I learned myself which is nice, you make a lot of mistakes, interesting mistakes very often, and you just go.</p>\n<p><strong>One of the things I really liked with the Sendai project was that if you or Peter didn’t like something you were working on you’d scrap it straight away – it’s a total no compromise attitude to composing.</strong></p>\n<p>It’s like Peter said in that interview life is too short for stuff like that. If he came up with a track that he really likes and I don’t care about - he’s free to use it for his own stuff, but we actually have a tendency to just throw it away.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/13362007154\" title=\"Sendai by straylandings, on Flickr\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Sendai\" height=\"222\" src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7129/13362007154_5f02014ea4_z.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/></a></p>\n<p>That’s also how I work with my own stuff, when I make a track and it doesn’t feel right I trash everything, sounds included. It’s probably why I like working with my modular, it has no memory - you can’t save any patches, it’s a very destructive way of making music.</p>\n<p><strong>Remixing do you find you have to change how you work much?</strong></p>\n<p>It depends on the original. I’m not snobbish about the modular, so if I do a remix and there’s nothing I hear in there that I need my modular for I’m not going to force it. I’m very picky about it when I do my own stuff but for remixes I don’t care, the only question for me is ‘in what way do you think you can make this track more your own?’</p>\n<p><strong>I wanted to ask about the SonuoS remix in particular, I really liked that one. How did that come about?</strong></p>\n<p>I’ve known Finn (Albertsson) via Facebook for a couple of years, because he’s pretty active – I think he’s the boss of Facebook in Scandinavia or something! (Laughs) It’s clear that he’s into music and we get along very well. I’ve never met him in person but it’s fun to talk and share ideas. At some point he was like ‘I have the opportunity to start my own label, would you mind doing a remix for me?’ and I thought ‘sure, sounds fun’.</p>\n<p>Also I knew that Andreas Tilliander would do the mastering, and I’ve known Andreas for years already – it sounded like a nice setup, a bunch of people who know and respect each other and want to work together.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/66886455&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>All the people on that label are new to me but all amazing. I saw you post about Martin Thompson’s SM-LL label as well who has also released on SonuoS.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah Pokk - it’s amazing. I’ve been in touch a lot with Martin. I met him through his blog he’s doing, the sound per day thing with his Nord Modular G1. It’s because of him that I also bought a Nord Modular.</p>\n<p>The cool thing about Martin is that he takes his time and he considers things a lot, and then suddenly he gets a bunch of tracks together and the results are amazing. I’m sure if he keeps doing this Pokk thing it’s going to work.</p>\n<p><strong>With your own label, the Archives Intérieures what are your plans there?</strong></p>\n<p>The first Sendai was released on Time To Express and it must have been quite a shock for people who buy Time To Express stuff because it’s straight forward techno, then all of a sudden there’s this Sendai <em>Geotope</em> album and it’s not dance floor. We thought since Time To Express has this history as a techno label it makes more sense to do something else to release experimental stuff. It took us a while to get to the idea of this Archives Intérieures thing - it was ideal for us to release our own stuff, but we’re also going to release other artists now. The next artist is going to be John Elliot from Outer Space, we’re doing a CD reissue of a vinyl album he did a few years ago - that should be out in June. Then there is another artist whose name I can’t mention yet – that’s will be for September.</p>\n<p>There’s no pressure we just want to keep a steady pace and release every three or four months.  The whole thing is this idea of building an Archive, that’s why the artwork is always kind of similar - it’s this feeling of a series. It’s not just a CD-only label - a lot of people think its just CDs, but there’s going to be vinyl for sure.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the plan for your own productions this year?</strong></p>\n<p>There’s going to be a remix out soon, then at the end of June / early July there’s going to be a four track EP which is a bit more dance floor, it’s pretty heavy.  It’s pretty intense and the guys from the label were like ‘make us something techno’. I was supposed to make four tracks but ended up doing seven and then throwing away the first three – they were too techno for me, by the time I was transferring the files I was already bored of them.They were very supportive, but also very honest, and I appreciate honesty.</p>\n<p>We’re also working on a new Sendai as well, that should be finished very soon, it should be ready in six or seven weeks - A four track EP as well. Then there’s two other labels who’ve asked me to do stuff for them, getting me out of my comfort zone again. There’s no date set for that as it still has to be made but when I think of it, I’m pretty busy until the end of the year.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/133552653&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>With the volume of labels seeming to snowball in recent years, a solid, unique identity has become all the more important for those thinking of establishing their own imprint. One such label which doesn’t seem to have struggled in finding artistic direction is London based SM-LL, the character of which is strongly linked to that of its founder, Martin J Thompson, aka Pokk.</p>\n<p>“The main reason I ended up starting the label, was to be able to experiment and present the music and ideas that I am simply not experiencing with other labels and artists.” Thompson says of the label’s origins. “Don’t get me wrong, there is some incredible music out there; there is also plenty of stuff I am not so interested in, but ultimately there is more access to choice than there has ever been. Still, the actual output I am hearing seems overpowered by this access to choice, this ‘click click’ era we are in, and I felt the balance of quantity and quality was questionable, at least to my taste.”</p>\n<p>So far the label’s output has been digital, categorised by Thompson’s ‘Default’ sub-header; a tag which he describes as “a starting point or a baseline to something more to come.”</p>\n<p>“I still feel in many ways the label is very much in a pre-label stage at present, and I think it won’t be until the first physical record is released with the SM-LL0000 code on it, that I can really feel things are getting to a place I envisioned” Thompson hints at the future plans of the label.</p>\n<p>&quot;Default will continue on past the first vinyl release, so in that sense it’s not so much a thing that only exists before. Nor is it something that is only to be used a test bed, although that is certainly part of it. With Default it’s more a case of allowing something to occur between the two outputs of Default and SM-LL, a constant comparison and assessment of where we are and where we might go with it all.</p>\n<p>Releasing digitally is something I am still adjusting to, it certainly has its good and bad qualities, but I am very much a person of my time, preferring physical objects.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2803/13155335455_f3f98e60a3_z.jpg\" alt=\"old-and-new\"></p>\n<p>With the first of the Default series authored by Thompson himself in September of last year, subsequent releases have come from Japanese producer Durusin, and most recently ‘en creux’ a new rhythmic project of sound artist Lucia H Chung, with whom Thompson has worked frequently in the past, perhaps most notably together as Mimosa Moize. “In all honesty I didn’t think it was going to happen for a long time to come until one day I got to hear the two tracks that I ended up releasing for Default” he states of the release.</p>\n<p>“As soon as I heard them there was no question in my mind, they were a perfect fit and as a result it all happened very quickly. I really like her approach to sound, she listens and is able to take things much further than I would ever be able to. I really admire what she does, it’s this sort of micro distortion, really subtle in its details - not over-worked. It fits the label perfectly right now and hopefully reveals to the listeners what they might expect in the future.”</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/135929583&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<p>The three releases so far have all been characterised by their repetitious, minimalist nature; subtle variations and delicate production a defining feature. Perhaps predictably, many of these sonic qualities have parallels with the label’s visual identity, a feature which gives it a strong presence. “The visual side of SM-LL is very important to me” Thompson begins when asked about the label’s aesthetic.</p>\n<p>“For a long time I understood these two worlds of sound and design with two very different mindsets. I struggled a great deal working in two areas and I found it hard to find anyone who found this a struggle like I did. I think it largely had something to do with identity, that we are defined largely, if not solely, by what we do. What we do is often confused with how we earn a living, and this often takes up most of our time doing something, so questions of priority occur. Quite often these two worlds don’t understand each other and I think it’s a long process of finding ways to demonstrate their compatibility, finding a personal voice for it.</p>\n<p>When I work in design, and enjoy it, I basically imagine the sorts of processes I would use when creating music. I often talk about design in the same way to making a track, this really works for me.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7081/13155343615_8a1ca18492_z.jpg\" alt=\"diagonal-lines\"></p>\n<p>In both graphic work and production, Thompson has developed a rather interesting method of working; looking through the photos on SM-LL’s Facebook you can chart different formulations of the logo and artistic direction as it was refined. Similarly, Thompson’s online journal ‘Mono-log’ see’s him revealing productions at different stages of development, posting different audio sketches and experiments. “For a long time I would make work, and I might share it with a few people but that was it. I never felt it was good enough, or finished.” he says of this method of working in the open.</p>\n<p>“It’s something I found really, really hard, but through taking my time and slowly forcing myself to do it everyday, it ended up showing me things that I could never have experienced any other way. I learned that I have no idea what I am doing…(laughs). I mean, I have a rough idea of how to make something as I want, but really, the goal is always over there somewhere and I know I need to go that way, but worrying about how, or if I screw up along the way, is not the right way to look at it. Ultimately working in this way has allowed me to let go a little, and work on creating new habits, let stuff happen, and basically just get on with it.”</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/117679296&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<p>The Mono-log experiments in fact gave Thompson a solid platform to get his sounds heard, leading to his debut release as Pokk on Swedish experimental label SonuoS. “Finn [Albertsson] and I started speaking online through a mutual interest in music as I really enjoyed one of his epic five hours mixes. I have to say I am not generally someone who listens to DJ mixes all that much, with the exception of a few, but Finn had something that I really appreciated. From this he started supporting my mono-log blog and basically really enjoyed the sketches that would eventually become the release. He picked out a few of the uploads that he wanted to hear combined and I worked from that. I finally presented him the result which he liked and that was it. It was a really quick process and for me this was massively important - It was done before I even had time to over think stuff.”</p>\n<img src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2417/13155336965_18b2fb99ea_z.jpg\">\n<p>Whilst the SonuoS release may have been the first release from the Pokk moniker, Thompson’s production history is extends back quite some distance. “I got into working with sound when I was ten years old, through a temptation to experiment with a big Kentucky Organ that was going to be thrown out.” Thompson states of his introductory experiences to music.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/104161558&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<p>“It had been sat in the living room barely touched for a long while and then was moved to the garage ready to be tipped. I think being out in the garage, away from everyone, it created an isolation that really appealed to me. I guess it could be thought of as my first studio experience in a way.” Given these beginnings, how Thompson’s studio has developed is rather impressive to say the least. His passion for hardware easy to spot; during a recent interview with us Yves De Mey mentioned how Thompson had helped recommend him the Nord Modular which he now composes with.</p>\n<p>“I made a decision a while back, to only buy and use equipment that I really enjoy using. So if I sit down and do nothing great in the studio, I can still come out pleased that I got the chance to explore these machines.” Thompson begins when asked about his setup.</p>\n<img src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2800/13155339475_26cc285cd6_z.jpg\">\n<p>“I have been more conscious of what the machines I buy look like; how I use them, how it is set-up in the studio, what era it is from, who used them and for what, all of this. Even before I sit down to work on something I have these machines just sitting there, staring at me and wanting to be turned on. Music was something I didn’t get at first, I think I was hesitant to venture into something I knew I was fascinated by, until I understood why, and once I finally started creating my own, I was simply amazed by the whole thing, it was incredible, still is.”</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/131504503&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Having incorporated a diverse array of influences in prior releases from Breakbeat to shoegaze rock, dub-techno seems to be where this latest LP finds its closest signifier. This is perhaps down to the pulsating, vapourous chords which feature frequently through the release. The hypnotic, off-beat sway of ‘Eiger Dreams’ or the featherlight ‘Junior High’ for example wouldn’t sound out of place amongst the Chain Reaction back-catalogue.</p>\n<p>This said, the album feels significantly more supple and unconstrained than much dub-techno. Sauntering, off-kilter rhythms are a constant through out LP, a mixture of ‘found sounds’ and live drumming complementing the pair’s warm, inviting atmospheres beautifully. ‘This American Life’ makes an excellent example, easing between opulent swathes of synthesiser, and stuttering, garage inflected drums.</p>\n<p>Structurally as well the record has a flexibility often not so characteristic with electronic genres. Ambient soundscapes make their developments subtly, between distant vocal samples - all the more effective for their sparse use. Both ‘Etern’ and following track ‘Balt Shakt II’ feature prominent use of these elements, at times downtrodden and introspective, at others soaringly intense, alternating between faltering half-step and cluttered, double-speed climaxes.</p>\n<p>_Silent Ascent _feels like potentially the most mature of Downliners Sekt’s full-length releases, capitalising on the delicate rhythms and evocative melodies which made some of their early EPs so special, whilst keeping a consistent theme throughout.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/134017234&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Hamburg’s Helena Hauff, resident DJ at the city’s legendary Golden Pudel club, has made her first forays as a musician over the past couple of years, releasing on acclaimed labels such as Werk Discs &amp; PAN, transferring the raw, hypnotic power of her DJ sets into primal analogue workouts that fall anywhere on a spectrum from acid house to electro and from techno to industrial.</p>\n<p>After beginning DJing in Hamburg a few years ago, Hauff has built an international reputation for herself, known for playing an extensive variety of music that goes beyond the polished sound of most house and techno and which draws upon a whole history of electronic dance music, with her sets often tracing a path between the fringes of that history.  As well as working as a solo musician, Hauff has released music as one half of Black Sites, a collaboration with fellow Golden Pudel resident F#x; and performs live as one half of Hypnobeat, a group that dates back to the early eighties and which was rebooted in recent years by founding member James Dean Brown who was so taken by Hauff’s Werk Discs release that he asked her to join the project. Hauff has both a solo release and a Black Sites release coming up on Panzerkreuz, an offshoot of longstanding Dutch label Bunker Records, and there are plans afoot for the release of new Hypnobeat live recordings.</p>\n<p>Hauff has been touring Europe in over the past few months and we caught up with her over the phone following her gig at the Audacious Art Experiment in Sheffield in late March to talk about all the above and more.</p>\n<p><strong>I saw you play in Sheffield recently, and I’m interested to know how similar that set and your sets generally as a touring DJ are to those as a resident at Golden Pudel?</strong></p>\n<p>Well the place (The Audacious Art Experiment) was quite similar – small and smoky and a good atmosphere, and I really enjoyed DJing there actually. I don’t think it was much different to what I’d usually play at the Golden Pudel, it was great! It’s quite rare that you have a place like that in England.</p>\n<p><strong>Presumably your sets whilst touring are less varied than those in Hamburg? There are only so many records you can carry…</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah exactly; the sets are quite similar maybe but I don’t play the same sets over and over again. When I play at the Pudel I like to take two record bags with me, which is pretty cool to have hundreds of records to choose from; but I can’t really do that touring as I have to get them onto an airplane with me.</p>\n<p><strong>Would you say you play weirder things in your sets at the Golden Pudel? And do you tend to play more direct, dancefloor-ready things when touring?</strong></p>\n<p>It depends, at times I play quite weird stuff at the Pudel but often I play straight techno. It really depends on how I feel, and when I go to a place it depends on what time I’m DJing. When people invite me I tend to play at peak time and I like to play banging techno, but elsewhere I might play a bit weirder – although not necessarily more experimental. I don’t think there’s a massive difference between what I do at the Pudel and what I do at other places, it’s just I know exactly what the feeling at the Pudel is like. At other places it might be the same and basically you can do whatever you want to do, but sometimes you realise you can’t.</p>\n<p><strong>What would you say is the background your DJing comes from? To me, the stuff you play and produce seems more aligned with say, industrial and experimental music, than with most techno. Does what you play come mainly from nightclub experiences of techno and electro or from other musical interests, such as an interest in punk?</strong></p>\n<p>Both I think. It’s techno music obviously, but I just don’t like normal techno, I like to listen to all sorts of different music. A big inspiration always was Bunker Records, and I just released on Panzerkreuz (an offshoot of Bunker). I just fucking love that label!</p>\n<p><strong>How did that Panzerkreuz release come about?</strong></p>\n<p>Bunker was basically the first label I got in touch with, like three, four years ago, and I invited the label boss Guy Tavares to play at the Pudel and he deejayed a few times at my night there. I just love the label and so got in touch with them, and I played a track of my own at one of my nights and he just said ‘that’s great, do you want to release on Bunker?’, and I just said ‘yeah, I wanna’!</p>\n<p><strong>Before we discuss you own music, just one more question about DJing. You’ve been playing a lot around Europe in recent weeks; are there any other cities or venues that have stood out for you as capturing the same sort of vibe as at the Pudel?</strong></p>\n<p>As I said, the gig in Sheffield was great, and that was quite close to the Pudel and the sort of thing I want from clubs in general. I really liked my gig at Dance Tunnel in London (for new night Darkroom), that was really cool as well. And in Leipzig at Conne Island, that was pretty cool. There are a lot of really really nice places, but it’s quite rare that everything comes together – with the right soundsystem, the right venue, the right people, and the right time.</p>\n<p><strong>You’re also playing at Corsica Studios in London, is that somewhere you’ve been before? Also, you’re playing alongside Veronica Vasicka (owner of Minimal Wave records) who I know you’re a fan of, have you played with her before?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah I played there once before, and I’ve seen her DJing twice, once at the Pudel and once at CTM festival in Berlin. And obviously I’m into that stuff, I love it and really like what she does; and so I’m really looking forward to it as I played there before and really enjoyed it – I think it’s a really good place.</p>\n<p><strong>Someone else who is on the bill at that night is Regis; and as I was listening to the upcoming Black Sites release on PAN I was really reminded of Regis. Is he someone you’re into and take inspiration from?</strong></p>\n<p>I really like what he does, although I didn’t know it sounded like Regis, so that’s cool. That’s not too bad really if it sounds like Regis…</p>\n<p><strong>The Black Sites release on Panzerkreuz is a split release with someone called Ghetto Gem, and I couldn’t find anything out about them at all other than that they’re from The Hague. Could you shed some light on that?</strong></p>\n<p>I don’t really know anything about them either to be honest! You should ask Guy Tavares from Bunker as he put us together on the record. I didn’t really know about it until it came out, but I love the Ghetto Gem track.</p>\n<p><strong>I also wanted to ask about the Hypnobeat project with James Dean Brown. I read that he got in contact with you about playing live with him after hearing the Werk Discs release. Would you say that playing with him has changed the way you approach making your own music?</strong></p>\n<p>The only thing that’s really changed is my attitude to playing live, I never thought that I’d play live before. It’s quite a good way of playing live – we play with three 808s and one 707; and it’s a very conceptual project I think. I never thought I’d play live because I enjoy DJing so much, but it’s so limited playing with that live set up that it’s easier to be focused as you can’t get lost in anything because you can’t do anything else other than play with a drum machine. What I hate about most live sets is that they aren’t very focused and you can’t really see where they’re going.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think you would ever play your own solo music live?</strong></p>\n<p>No I think that actually I would never do that.</p>\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/136904508&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I’ve heard that there are going to Hynobeat recordings this too – is that close to happening? And what can we expect – will it be recordings of live shows or studio recordings?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s definitely going to be takes from live shows. All the original Hypnobeat material from the 80s was recorded live, and we want to keep it that way. It’s probably going to be a recording from Berghain, as what we recorded there was quite nice. It was a fun set – very loud!</p>\n<p><strong>In terms of your own studio set up have you made any new additions recently?</strong></p>\n<p>I’d love to add to my collection but I’ve got no more room in my room. I need to move to a bigger space, it’s ridiculous! It’s so difficult to find flats in Hamburg too, it’s terrible. I’d love to buy some new gear if I could- I’d like to have more of the classics, like a 909 or something like that, or some modular synths.</p>\n<p><strong>You’re not going to start making music on a computer anytime soon then I take it…</strong></p>\n<p>I don’t think so, we’re talking on the phone right now as there’s no internet here and the laptop broke down, it’s terrible! My laptop isn’t working and any other computer that I ever touched broke down like the next day, so I think there’s something wrong with me or something… laptops and me don’t go together. Probably a sign that I should stay clear of them.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally, the obligatory question about what you have planned for the year apart from the releases we’ve already discussed?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m going to be DJing a lot, but hopefully I’ll have time to produce some new bits as well – I’m working on something for Werk Discs again. There are a few other things to come, but I’m not sure if they’ll happen this year or next year. There’s another 12” planned on Solar One Music from Jena, but I don’t know if it’ll be out before the end of the year. I might set up my own label actually, and I think I’ll release all sorts of different music – some rock, krautrock, stuff like that. I don’t want to do a techno label, I’d rather do a punk label. There’s so many techno labels that are doing a great job that I don’t feel there’s any need to do the same.</p>\n<p>Helena Hauff’s <em>Return to Disorder</em> is available now on Panzerkreuz Records, as is Black Sites vs. Ghetto Gem’s <em>Panzerkreuz 1029</em>.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.monotyperecords.com/\">Monotype</a>\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> CD / Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 05/05/2014</p>\n<p>New England based sound artist Derek Piotr has set Indonesian music at the heart of his latest album, <em>Tempatempat</em>. The title, ‘an Indonesian word chosen for its repetition and meaning’ can either mean ‘forging place’ or ‘fourth place’, depending on how you break the word, which is a good preview of the sonic vision that lies ahead. In his fourth album, Piotr fuses Indonesian music with his electronic and vocal background, honing the elements into a beautiful, exciting set of tracks.</p>\n<p>_Tempatempat _falls perfectly into place as soon as the opener, “Bhadrakali”, starts: at the drop of a low drum, catchy rhythms spring forward. Static surrounds this steady pulse like river water; think a field recording filled with glitches, only the glitches and buzzes all happen in time. It’s entrancing— gamelan sounds mix in and Piotr sings Indonesian melodies through a slightly warped, gently distorted filter. The track grows more melodic as Gendèr (Indonesian metallophone) sounds out descending scales, which make for a comforting comeback throughout the album.</p>\n<p>Piotr’s work has always been focused on vocals; this can be seen in “Rift”, a track produced entirely using his voice. In this track, Piotr seems to almost ignore Western music theory; his multi-layered vocals collide with each other, over and over in a series of dissonance. It’s unsettling, but never unbearable – the relentless development of the track holds your attention, background static in restlessly puncturing the cascading vocal lines.</p>\n<p>The glitch aesthetic manifests best in “Terminal”, which begins with deep bass hits, a glitchy, sparse background offsetting another set of dissonant vocals. Rapid percussion skips like a broken record, creating a dizzying ferocity that showcases the album’s two best qualities: Piotr’s innovative vocal manipulation and obsession with electronic noise.</p>\n<p>Piotr is unafraid to use whatever sounds he finds intriguing; this leads to his work being labelled as experimental. But _Tempatempat _is unexpectedly accessible— the fearless exploration of timbre and harmony never leaves you bored, and the meticulous production and structure always leaves something for you to hold onto without being overwhelmed. The album’s quiet moments are just as entrancing: “Stay” slowly pulls flat vocal lines into the track until they’re stretched for minutes at a time, the landscape ever expanding. In _Tempatempat, _a voice will drone on for two minutes, or a phrase will be cut into tiny fragments and scattered all over the track. This is a versatile and gripping album.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/123693647&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Having released his early work through the 1990s via the legendary Chain Reaction imprint, over the last few years Danish label Echocord has hosted the bulk of Soublis’ output, which seems fitting as one of the leading dub-techno imprints currently in operation. The latest offering <em>Broadwalk Tales</em> is no different, and comes at an interesting time, following last year’s reissue of Soublis’ compiled formative works, <em>Vibrant Forms</em>.</p>\n<p>The fact <em>Broadwalk Tales</em> was intended as a long-player from its inception is clear. The addition of Teddy Selassie’s sultry vocals make the record a more expansive yet equally more cohesive listening experience, without losing any of the ethereal, leftfield appeal which made <em>Vibrant Forms</em> so special. This said, the effectiveness of Selassie’s inclusion on the LP comes from the fact vocals are used sparingly, easing in and out of Soublis’ haze of dub, reggae and techno influences.</p>\n<p>‘Everyday’ for example glides across booming percussion, Selassie periodically adding to Soublis’ spellbinding melodies, with echoing, faintly melancholic outcries. ‘Change’ is another track to feature fairly prominent use of vocals, yet here they are warped and stuttered by Soublis, off-beat chimes and jaunty percussion snowballing into a stumbling reggae groove.</p>\n<p>In between these moments however the LP remains fairly instrumental. The drowsy, introspective pulse of ‘Ascent’ or the misty chords buffeting against one another through ‘The Steps’ make good examples of the power Soublis holds through his solo ventures on the album. The shimmering ‘Celestia’ is another illustration of this, and arguably one of <em>Broadwalk Tales</em> finest moments; subtle developments, warm, immersive synthwork and thickset, shuffled rhythms make for a hypnotic, inviting listen.</p>\n<p>Compared with his prior output, <em>Broadwalk Tales</em> feels broader and more inclusive in its use of dub &amp; reggae elements, absorbing these in a way which manages to keep a common thread with Soublis’ sound. The LP also does a fine job of exploring the link techno specifically has with dub &amp; reggae music, whilst still being as captivating a listen as any of Soublis’ back-catalogue.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/29644492&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

The extent to which the London based producer has followed through with this however is rather admirable.</p>\n<p>The fourth release on Thompson’s SM-LL imprint ingratiates the project with two tracks entitled ‘Kerning A’ &amp; ‘Kerning B’. A typographical term itself, Kerning is used to describe the process of adjusting the space between letters, an abstraction which it is easy to hear in application across the release.</p>\n<p>Diving into points in each track it is easy to hear their how the arrangements shift, broken analogue pulses buffeting against one another. Listening through start to finish however, the subtlety with which Thompson has applied his aforementioned concept begins to shine through; the experience is engrossing and hypnotic.</p>\n<p>If you were to half the speed of Vladislav Delay’s_ Kuopio_ the resultant sound might be similar. The stumbled rhythms and fractured ambience of ’Kerning A’ in particular has crossovers with Ripatti’s work, yet Thompson’s characteristically hyper-minimal production prevents it from feeling derivative.</p>\n<p>The release’s muted counterpart ‘Kerning B’ staggers forward, led by piercingly sharp hits, like a nail being consistently battered against without ever making even a millimetre of progress. As the loop continues, the track’s components begin faltering between one another, different elements manipulated by claustrophobic reverbs, before the cycle begins afresh.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/146270088&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p>“My interest of electronic music goes way back.” Kenneth Christiansen responds when asked about his formative years, working in various record stores around Copenhagen. “It started around 1990, with the first R&amp;S and Warp releases, all of what came out of Detroit and the dubby Berlin sound, but yes of course working in record shops over so many years, and listening to so much music definitely did something.” Having moved from his hometown in the south of Denmark to Copenhagen in 1996, Christiansen’s name is familiar to many in the City, if not for his work running one of its leading nightclubs, Culture Box alongside Loke Busch, then undoubtedly for the achievements of his stellar Dub-Techno imprint, Echocord.</p>\n<p>“I started the label in 2002, but I had already been thinking about setting it up for some time.” he states of Echocord’s origins. “In the record shops I have worked in I met many people, talented producers, and with good contacts at Kompakt in Cologne, it was the right thing to do. It all finally happened when I met Mikkel Metal aka Mikkel Meldgaard - he gave me a demo with some tracks that I really liked. I sent it to Michael and Wolfgang at Kompakt and they loved it as well, and so it all started.”</p>\n<p>Twelve years on and it looks like the label’s establishment certainly was ‘the right thing to do’, being arguably the most celebrated dub-techno imprint currently in operation. This doesn’t look set to change anytime soon either, the label having recently played host to Fluxion’s latest LP, <em>Broadwalk Tales,</em> pushing the association Techno has with Dub &amp; Reggae to the limit. “I have known Fluxion for many years now, and released a lot by him, so making another album was a natural thing to do, especially since I’m a very big fan of his music” Christiansen responds when asked about the formation of the release. “I have been following him since the beginning, with his Chain Reaction releases and the Vibrant Music imprint. This album has been in the works for some time. When Fluxion and I played in New York a couple of years ago, he met up with Teddy Selassie, who did the vocals on this album, and that’s where it started.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2928/13893063407_d9b6f2d283_z.jpg\" alt=\"ec28\"></p>\n<p>If the main label’s output wasn’t impressive enough on its own, in 2008 Christiansen also set up sub-label Echocord Colour, to broaden the spectrum of releases even further. “Echocord is more focussed on deeper dubbier stuff” he says of the differences between the two imprints. “ Echocord Colour is typically much harder music, more Techno or even Dubstep orientated, but of course still with dub elements.”</p>\n<p>A mediation between dub, and more functional techno also seems to lie at the heart of ‘Pattern Repeat’ a production project run between Christiansen and Baum Records founder Dennis Bøg, which goes a long way in showing the influences between their other respective ventures. “Dennis Bøg aka Resoe is a very good friend of mine for many years, and we worked together in a record shop called ‘Loud’ for several years” he explains of their relationship. “At that time I had been running Echocord for a few years already, and Dennis started up his own label Baum. We had the same passion for Dub Techno, that we both already released on our labels. We also like the more rough metallic Techno sound, so we decided to try working in Dennis’ studio together, and suddenly we had some tracks done, and kind of found our own sound.”</p>\n<p>With the most recent EP released in mid 2012, it’s been a little while since material has surface from Pattern Repeat, yet the project certainly hasn’t been concluded. “We had a longer break, not because we don’t want to continue, but we both had too much work to do, plus kids and family” Christiansen reveals on the topic of the project’s hiatus. “But now we have just been back in the studio, so for sure there will be another Pattern Repeat release, also some PR gigs again soon.”</p>\n<p>With the pressures of family life combined with running Echocord it’s understandable that there has been little time free for Pattern Repeat releases as of late. This is without considering his work running Culture Box with Loke Busch as well, a nightclub which has hosted everyone from Jamie XX and James Blake to Len Faki and Luke Slater.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7425/14076461842_04261134e7_z.jpg\" alt=\"kennethbillederbma3\"></p>\n<p>“In the 90’s there were more big raves happening, but not so often like regular clubs, only popup events and a few festivals. I started to do events in Copenhagen at the end of the 90s mostly in warehouses and clubs” referring to his formative experiences running events. “In 2005 we started up Culture Box, because at that time not much was really going on here, so we needed a place for electronic music every weekend. Over the last few years many smaller venues, clubs and festivals now focus on underground electronic music here in Copenhagen.”</p>\n<p>With the aforementioned surge of interest in electronic music in Copenhagen, Culture Box seems like the place many people will find it, with the likes of Function, Efdemin and Nina Kraviz all set for visits over the next month. 2014 looks to be as productive a year as ever for Echocord as well. “After the Fluxion album, I will release a new EP by XDB, and after that a Fluxion Remix EP” we are informed of the label’s future release plans. “On Echocord Colour there will be two EPs by Roberto Clementi with remixes by Marcel Dettmann and Norman Nodge.”</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/143495223&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Whilst he doesn’t pinpoint exactly when he began toying with production software, his compositions are more telling; carefully constructed webs of noise and found sounds come together in a way which suggest he has been working on the project for some time. &quot;I used to DJ under a different name but I’ve never put any tracks out before&quot; he expands. &quot;The Airsilk project has only come about in the past few months - I figured it was about time I started getting myself out there and see what people thought.&quot;</p>\n<p>The timing of the project is likely not incidental either, having moved down to the capital from his hometown of Leicester in the last few years, his studies have drawn him further into the world of sound-design.</p>\n<p>&quot;I’m really keen on using elements from sound design and noise music because I think using those kind of techniques create a unique, organic quality that’s difficult to replicate&quot; he speaks of the writing processes used on the project. &quot;I’m always looking to record or find interesting field recordings, especially as you can discover weird artefacts in the recordings to use too.

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> Combat Recordings\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 12/05/14</p>\n<p>'All tracks are aggressive DJ weapons' reads London based Combat Recordings' Discogs profile. Indeed, if I were forced to condense this review of their latest offering to one line it might read something similar. Comprised of four original tracks from Edinburgh based producer Ingen &amp; Ontal's Boris Noiz, the EP is also backed by an earthquaking remix from Monster X &amp; Stormfield's Fausten project.</p>\n<p>The release is constructed with stark brutalism; the muscular jolting percussion of a track such as ‘Rituals’ is designed with raw functionality at its core, yet its affront no-nonsense assembly is also where its appeal lies. ’Root &amp; Stem’ is similarly heavyweight. Here the track’s distorted drums are offset by a snaking 303 riff, incessantly dragging the track forward.</p>\n<p>This aside however, the release remains largely free of tonal elements, leaving the harmonics with which Ingen &amp; Noiz ease from their percussive elements room to be heard with clarity. ‘Symbols’ is an excellent example of this - a contrast of reverberant hits and dryer foundational elements leaves more than enough for the listen to become immersed in. The later half of the track works into a distorted frenzy of broken rhythms, like a rock drummer pumped full of amphetamines and let loose on a kit processed through a chain of fuzz pedals and filters.</p>\n<p>Boris Noiz’s presence is made known through ‘Spikes’, calling to mind Ontal’s Violet Poison released ‘Function’ with its jackhammer drums and severe, grating textures. Processed glitches and vapourous hits are reinforced by the duo’s harshly overdriven kick pattern.</p>\n<p>Heading up the release is Fausten’s jumbled recast of  ’Root &amp; Stem’. The original’s acid-hook reinforced by menacing blasts of sub-bass and clattering mechanical percussion.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/139621073&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>&quot;When I was around thirteen, I got hold of a Microkorg Synth&quot; Romek Boyer, better known as simply Rommek states when asked about how he first got into producing. &quot;I jammed a lot but never recorded any of the ideas. I think this gave me the drive to want to make my own tracks, later combined with a computer.&quot; Given the fluidity of Boyer’s rugged, off-kilter productions it’s perhaps little surprise he began by improvising and experimenting rather than structuring elements on a computer. &quot;From a young age my dad introduced me to new sounds and artists like Aphex Twin or Rhythm &amp; Sound&quot; he explains further, &quot;who influenced my ideas for production. Similarly the atmospheres created by these artists and others alike inspire me.&quot;</p>\n<p>Techno has become the genre of choice for many producers in recent years, yet Boyer’s productions retain a distinct sound, a factor which has not gone unnoticed, having recently put out an EP with Weekend Circuit. “I wanted to get involved with a London Label, with an underground but powerful output and Weekend Circuit was ideal” he expands of the release. “The EP features two original tracks which develop in their own ways and I thought they would suit the WCR sound.There has been consistently good remixers involved with the label, so I was more interested in knowing, than surprised by who the artists were.”</p>\n<p>Further to this Boyer has also recently released the dub-tinged ‘Puffin’ via Southampton’s No Logo imprint, and also has plans for further EP releases later in the year.</p>\n<p>His mix for us covers a range of personal influences, and was constructed not without some serious thought. “I spent some time making a few different versions of the mix until I was happy with the way it fitted together” he says of the recording. “I wanted to put a good amount of my own material in it, plus a mix of old and new favourites which suit the mood I was in when I recorded it.”</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Rommek // Skeleton [Unreleased]</li>\n<li>Rrose // Wedge [Eaux]</li>\n<li>SHXCXCHCXSH // WHTLGHT [Avian]</li>\n<li>Cassegrain // Painter Of Modern Life [M_Rec]</li>\n<li>Developer // Tiburon [Gynoid Audio]</li>\n<li>Rommek // Thought Patterns (Adriana Lopez Remix) [Weekend Circuit]</li>\n<li>Divided // Eigen [Unreleased]</li>\n<li>MD2 // MD2 4.1 [MD2]</li>\n<li>Rommek // Puffin [No Logo]</li>\n<li>Mike Parker // Pulse Trader [Prologue]</li>\n<li>Markus Suckut // Mirage [Figure]</li>\n<li>J.Tijn // Nuke [Pennyroyal]</li>\n<li>Rommek // Rust [Unreleased]</li>\n<li>Ø [Phase] -Binary Opposition (CTRLS Process) [Unknown]</li>\n<li>Rommek // Forest Depths [Weekend Circuit]</li>\n<li>Alex Falk // BPR [Proper Trax]</li>\n<li>Little Nobody // Metropolis How (James Ruskin Remix) [Gynoid Audio]</li>\n<li>Rommek // The Hole In My Pocket [Unreleased]</li>\n<li>Rommek // De Ja Vu [Unreleased]</li>\n<li>Rommek // Root Canal [Unreleased]</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/stray-landings-mix-series/id556425050?mt=2\">Subscribe in iTunes</a></p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"60\" src=\"//www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?feed=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0029-rommek%2F&amp;mini=1&amp;embed_uuid=92106154-a03f-4146-b693-cda43259acad&amp;replace=0&amp;hide_cover=1&amp;hide_artwork=1&amp;embed_type=widget_standard&amp;hide_tracklist=1\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/0029-rommek/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=resource_link\">0029 // Rommek</a> by <a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=profile_link\">Stray Landings</a> on <a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=homepage_link\"> Mixcloud</a></p>\n",

With a career spanning back to the early 2000s as a D&amp;B producer, Kaye’s Trevino project provided something of a reinvigoration for the Manchester based artist, as he was able to approach new genres without worrying about expectations.</p>\n<p>The enthusiasm for new sounds is easy to hear in his productions as well, covering everything from dark, foreboding techno to anthemic, rave-influenced House music.</p>\n<p>With a gig at Fabric scheduled in for the 31st May, we decided to catch up with Kaye to discuss the show, plans for a Trevino album, and searching for DJs in the Hacienda.</p>\n<p><strong>So I’ve been listening to your remix for Last Magpie this morning which is released soon I believe – how did that come about? Is remixing something you find easy or are you quite selective about what you will work on?</strong></p>\n<p>Its something I enjoy, I don’t necessarily find it easy but you just get given pieces of a jigsaw. What I usually do is before I agree to do the remix I’ll listen to the tune to see if there’s anything in there that I think I could touch.</p>\n<p>I’ll go through the separate sounds that they send me and pick some out that I like, have one listen to the original and then forget it ever happened – forget the vibe of the tune, then I basically just start writing a track with the pieces they’ve given me. I’m just having fun with other people’s sounds more than anything, I’m not trying to make it a better version just put my stamp on it – if there’s sounds I’d like to play with I’ll just have a jam in the studio. It’s just nice to mess around with other people’s stuff - It gives it a bit of a different angle, a bit more fun almost.</p>\n<p><strong>With the Trevino project you’ve covered a pretty wide breadth of styles – releasing on everything from Klockworks, known for serious, long-playing techno to the more playful, ravey stuff released on [NakedLunch] &amp; 3024. How do you feel about the process of finding ones sound? Is this a process you think any producer ever really escapes?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s part of my thinking that maybe I have a sound, but it’s quite varied. I’m not exactly sure if that’s a good thing or a bad thing anymore - I can’t work it out. Especially with the gigs, you can turn up at some and its like a proper house gig and then the week after its a techno gig. Sometimes I don’t know before I go to these things what I’m getting booked for.</p>\n<p>Its something I’m thinking about a lot at the moment because I have so much music. I’m starting a new label and I’m thinking of starting it with an album just to get some of this music out the way… I’ve made a couple of tracks which I’m not even sure I’m going to put my name to them. They have a lot of potential but the sound is so far removed from say the  Klockworks things – it’s just going to confuse people even more. Maybe its time for another alias…</p>\n<p>I don’t mind people knowing behind the scenes its all Marcus Intalex to a certain extent, but maybe there needs to be a specific name for a specific sound. It’s something I’m going to speak to a lot of people about over the next few weeks and really get some opinions on.</p>\n<p><strong>I think very few artists are singular about the style they want to make but maybe it needs to be presented in that way sometimes, as people seem to get confused very easily.</strong></p>\n<p>Well yeah, there’s just so much good music coming from all angles in the House &amp; Techno world, I get excited by quite a lot of it so I don’t want to just make one kind of tune. The Trevino thing was freedom for me, I did’t have to worry about fitting in. With D&amp;B it always had to fit – there were all these stipulations about what it had to be and how it had to sound. I think Trevino gave me that lease of life where I didn’t have to think about it that much, but now I’m starting to have to a little bit.</p>\n<p><strong>Is the label the the same project that was mentioned in that Attack article a few years ago?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, I mean it’s been in the works for a long time and I’ve been trying to work out who the best distributor is, I want to keep it separate from the Soul:r stuff . I’ve also started to find it a bit difficult to A&amp;R my own music - there’s all these questions and rather than confront them, what I’ve done is just gone ‘yeah I’ll sort that out later’. I’ve gone in the studio instead and started making more music to confuse myself even more you know what I mean (laughs).</p>\n<p>It’s got to the point now where I’ve just made a decision and  something will happen in the next three months at the most, finally.</p>\n<p><strong>And Soul:r &amp; Revolve:r are continuing as well right?</strong></p>\n<p>Still continuing with Soul:r yeah, I’m not sure what I’ll do with Revolve:r. Maybe that could become something a bit more experimental, I’ve not really thought about it to be fair. Soul:r and the new label will be the priority that’s for sure. I’ve got probably half a dozen tracks signed for Soul:r, then the new DRS album so there’s things afoot that’s for sure. There’s just so much to do, at some point I just need to do it you know what I mean, maybe take some time out from writing music to make sure it all comes out.</p>\n<p>**The other thing in that Attack interview you mentioned how the Trevino project brought back the feeling of being excited, and even a little nervous at gigs rather than just ‘coasting’. After a few years of the project do you still feel the same energy you did then? **</p>\n<p>Yeah a little bit, there are gigs that are slightly more of a test. There’s <em>nowhere</em> were I play as Intalex that concerns me in the slightest. Just through doing it so many times it’s just a case of turning up and playing music. With the Trevino thing though I still get a little nervous pre-gig but tend to find as soon as I start I’m pretty much up for it… I have always played longer sets with D&amp;B ,or at least wanted to, so having to do longer as Trevino is something I’m well prepared for.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you still remember some of the first nights you went to? What was your first exposure to House &amp; Techno?</strong></p>\n<p>I think it was in ‘86 - ‘87, we started our own night. I’m from a small town called Burnley and we were influenced by what was going on in Manchester, just UK-wise with this explosion of House music. Stuff you’d hear and read about, but we weren’t really old enough to be doing it. So we started our own events and played back in 88. We’d been to the Hacienda once or twice, and played in a local club that had a little bit of House music and just jumped on the revolution as soon as it started almost! The Hacienda played a massive part in all of it, and subsequent things in Manchester afterwards. Manchester was at the forefront of that core beginning of House music, and the Hacienda rightfully gets name-checked for that. I guess without sounding overly cheesy, that’s kind of where I got my education from musically.</p>\n<p>I went to a New Order gig in ‘87 and New Order were great… In fact they weren’t that great they were pretty shit live, but it was the buzz of being there at the Hacienda and the DJ came on afterwards and played House music for about an hour. I couldn’t find him, I couldn’t see where he was. He was up on the balcony in some little room but you could only see him from on the stage. I spent about an hour trying to work out where this music was coming from! It was the first night I’d ever been to where the DJ wasn’t talking, back in the day they’d play a tune and grab the mic almost like a radio DJ. That was the first night I’d ever been to where they didn’t and it pretty much blew my mind.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/13949929848\" title=\"Marcus_Intalex by straylandings, on Flickr\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Marcus_Intalex\" height=\"399\" src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5038/13949929848_0a4c58001d_z.jpg\" width=\"640\"/></a></p>\n<p>I’ve followed House &amp; Techno since then to an extent - there was just a period in the early ’90s where it got overly cheesy, with this whole Italian House – big pianos everywhere and it just fucking drove me nuts. I backlashed against it and got into the breaks and the basslines that were coming out of Sheffield and London and stuff. It was a different kind of sound completely and that’s how I followed into D&amp;B almost. I think the breaks excited me more than the 4/4 stuff because it was a lot fresher and rougher, not overly well produced but full of futuristic ideas, where as House music had gone all hands in the air.</p>\n<p>I don’t like happy music that much, I like it a bit moodier, and a bit darker. I guess I always was more into Techno than House to an extent, especially the Detroit stuff. Something more thoughtful, more emotive that made you think a bit more than just fucking turning up at a club, take a pill and put your hands in the air for four hours. I moved away from House because of that and Manchester did get like that because of people like Sasha who was fucking massive, but it was just too euphoric for my liking.</p>\n<p>Problem was  between 91-96 there were very few clubs that supported the more london sound in Manchester. There was a lot of violence in the clubs, a lot of gang problems which spilled over into club politics and club owners were afraid of putting that kind of music on for fear of what kind of people it might bring. So it died in Manchester, it was criminal really. The Hardcore scene before it turned into Jungle was pretty much non-existent. I worked in a record shop during that period and we would sell fucking hundreds of these tunes, people loved it! It’s quite surprising how it didn’t die because there was really very few places if nowhere to go and listen to it, it’s pretty crazy.</p>\n<p>**I guess the House scene began to rationalise itself around then and become more formulaic, where as the break based stuff was just taking off and people approached it with a fresher perspective. **</p>\n<p>It had a bit more of that ‘this is the future’ sound to it and I’ve always been excited by futuristic sounding music. You look back at when that Chicago thing broke, and especially in Detroit – that was electronic music that was <em>so</em> futuristic. I’d never heard anything like it, but as time went on especially in the UK it did start to get more cheesy and based around people taking pills. I know these tunes are made for people taking pills – super emotive and super hands in the air, everyones rushing their tits off and I’m like this is shit! (laughs). It’s just not for me. People used to come up to me and be like ‘you got any E tunes Marcus’ and like I know what they are but I’m not fucking playing them, I’m not here for that it’s not my thing.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/103720385&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<p>I’d go to London once every couple of months, I was only 20 or 21 - the scene down there was completely different. I’d go to hear what they’re doing and check the record shops down there because there was all these white label tunes coming from London, and they’d very rarely make it up north, they’d all sell out before they got there. The north south divide was almost like a split in the music as well. Two completely different scenes, Sasha and Graeme Park and all these Hacienda DJs were massive up north but rarely got any gigs down south, and you’d never see the likes of Grooverider and Fabio in Manchester. It was just a mad musical split, and typically I’m the person that lives up north and likes the sound from down south!</p>\n<p>**Have you ever been tempted to leave the area? **</p>\n<p>I like London to visit, it just fucking wears me out! I’m as happy leaving London as I am arriving there - it was never in the equation I don’t think. It never really appealed to me that much. I like Manchester, it’s a good size and there’s a lot going on here. I’ve always felt an affinity to it and I’m pretty sure I always will.</p>\n<p><strong>I think being in a place where you can have space away from music is just as important as being around it otherwise it just tires you out.</strong></p>\n<p>It completely does. I mean for years it’s just music coming from all angles and you end up stopping loving the music you’re supposed to love.</p>\n<p>During some of the period of doing D&amp;B it was a full-on 24/7 job and it was driving me nuts to be fair. If the music gets to a point where it’s disappointing you and that’s your career, that’s your love - it affects your mindset, it affects your moods, it affects everything. I guess a wiser Marcus now plays a different game almost.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/38123910&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Talking about London and stuff, you’re playing at Fabric on May 31st, I imagine you must have played the club quite a few times now over your career. Can you remember the first gig you had there?</strong></p>\n<p>That’s for sure! I played before Andy C it was probably about 2000ish? I enjoyed it, I thought it was a good place to play music. The hospitality there and the way they look after you was pretty special and it always has been. That was the first thing I noticed – dead welcoming. They had people there just to work with the DJs which was pretty much before anyone had every done that and it really struck a chord with me. Even though I was nervous as a motherfucker, i was comfortable , thinking this is fucking cool, these guys are nice.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about whats next in terms of your release plans?</strong></p>\n<p>I’ve got an idea where I’m going to do two Trevino albums, and split them down the middle so one comes out as the first release on the new label – nine tracks. And then another nine tracks either late in the year or early next year. I’ve decided which are the nine, I’ve got the name for the label, I’ve got the design, I’ve pretty much got the distribution in place. Just a couple of touches to the music over the next couple of weeks and then I think I’m just going to go with it. Apart from a few remixes I’ve done there hasn’t really been a 12” for six or twelve months.</p>\n<p>There’s plenty of music, that’s not the issue, I’m trying to slow down but I really enjoy the writing process, there something quite therapeutic about it. In terms of organising myself…  I don’t know what I’ve been doing to be fucking fair! (laughs) I’m just gonna try and  get more music out there.</p>\n<p>**Is the label something you’re going to use for your own productions mainly or do you have other artists in mind as well? **</p>\n<p>Yeah, there’ll be myself and I’m starting to write a bit of music with Endian. He’s really good man, he’s good fun to work with. Then I don’t know, it’s not a global domination project to take over the world, it’s more a vehicle to put more of my own stuff out when I feel like. There’s no real set in stone plan, we’ll just see where it goes.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/67583863&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>The Techno world can seem isolating at times. Where collaborations by producers with individual projects do happen, few work both so successfully and so frequently as German duo, Sawlin &amp; Subjected. Releasing primarily on Subjected’s own imprint, Vault Series, the pair have become well known for their rugged, long-playing brand of Techno, a style which draws on each of their individual styles in equal measure.</p>\n<p>Having recently provided the second of their ‘Foreign Awake’ EP series for Speedy J’s Electric Deluxe, we decided to catch up with the pair to discuss the mechanics of their collaboration in more depth.</p>\n<p><strong>So to begin with, what have you two been up to over the last few months?</strong></p>\n<p>Sa: I continued working on my EPs and my album an das usual, mastering.</p>\n<p>Sub: I quit my full-time job in January and remodelled my studio. Now I can make music properly again, I’ve made several remixes recently and am also working on some further EPs.</p>\n<p>**Can you tell us a little bit about your recent collaboration, ‘Foreign Awake Pt.2’? **</p>\n<p>Sa: As the name says, it’s a continuation of Part.1 and is also similar sound-wise. We already have new material that’s different from these two EPs. I always find it interesting how two different developments come together.</p>\n<p>**You’ve released together a number of times on the Vault Series, how did you first meet each other and start working together? **</p>\n<p>Sub: We met through Mørbeck. Back then Ron had advised me when I was buying my Computer and Equipment. He also taught me the basics of how to make music on the computer. Since then we make music together on a regular basis, we often share ideas and have become good friends.</p>\n<p>**This is your second release together on a label other than Vault Series – what was the thinking behind that and why the departure to Electric Deluxe? **</p>\n<p>Sub: I spontaneously played at a Electric Deluxe label night in Berghain because Polar Intertia could no longer play. Speedy J’s reponse to this was great and since then we were often in contact. Speedy J knows our productions and has played several tracks from my album. When Ron and I produced together again, and when we had a couple of tracks ready, I said ‘let’s send those tracks to Electric Deluxe’ and Jochem signed them.</p>\n<p>**How does the writing process work between you two? Are you both there in the studio at the same time or do you produce parts separately and bring them together at a later stage? **</p>\n<p>Sa: I actually prefer to work in the independent way, but I am surprised how constructive sitting together can be. We don’t have a set method or procedure though. We often experiment in Martin’s studio before we have any basis, around which we then build the rest. Time always flies so fast during this. And after almost every session we have a finished track. We don’t use templated or finished samples or loops, but build everything from scratch, although it is common that it’s Martin’s arrangement. He’s just better at that.</p>\n<p><strong>Does the writing process, and how you think about making a record, differ depending on the label it’s coming out on? Or do you let it come out more naturally?</strong></p>\n<p>Sub: It’s difficult to say. Sometimes we have a fixed idea on which direction or for which label the track shall be, and something we just jam and try new or experimental iPad apps or other studio gear. When the track is finished, we then see for which label it would be suitable.</p>\n<p>**In more general terms, how do you think the process of collaborating affects how your music sounds? **</p>\n<p>Sub: When we work together, we both contribute our parts and then we sometimes try out new techniques, so that we both participate and benefit. I then usually do the arrangement. When I work alone, I obviously work differently and have different production procedures.</p>\n<p>Sa: It’s difficult to put this in words. Of course, when you’re working with someone, you notice the way techniques gets used and how the creative process develops, and you almost automatically synchronise. What I realised the most, is that when we are in his studio our music takes on a Subjected sound aesthetic. And when we’re at my studio, then its my aesthetic. Also the acoustic of the room and the speakers have a big influence on the end result.</p>\n<p>**Earlier last year we saw the debut Subjected LP, ‘Zero’. Are there any plans for a joint LP or a solo Sawlin LP? **</p>\n<p>Sa: I think that the collaborations have to become established and then we can speak about such a project. With my album, Delsin has already asked me and it is, as said, in progress. However I cant say when and in what format this will be released.</p>\n<p>Sub: I can definitely imagine making an LP together. Let’s just see how much output we’ll have in the next sessions.</p>\n<p>**How did Zero shape things for the Vault Series? **</p>\n<p>Sa: I’d like to know that too!</p>\n<p>Sub: When the Vaults series first happened, I never imagined that there would be an album or a remix series to be released. But since then a lot has changed. The label has gained a lot of respect and at some point the point comes when you need to further develop yourself. Vault Series is still a platform for Sawlin and myself but it has become a bit more loose in recent times; for example we have signed a new mysterious act: Mistake Made. Something that, before the album, I couldn’t have imagined.</p>\n<p><strong>Besides the new EP, what are your plans for the next few months? Any exciting projects you can tell us about? Thank you for your time!</strong></p>\n<p>Sa: I can’t give a definite answer on this, as this has proven to be a trap in the best. You often get requests and then the label changes their mind. There are several projects up for discussion but it only gets confirmed when the date for mastering gets set.</p>\n<p>Sub: The next Vault Series is going to be a Solo EP by Sawlin, after that we’ll have the Vault Series 15.0 by Mistake Made. Maybe we’ll also have another remix series soon. Solo I’ve just done a remix for Silent Steps and soon a solo EP will be released on ARTS. More EPs on other labels are already in progress but it would be to soon to say names right now.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/103529040&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Rrose’s promotional presence is impressively minimal in this regard, yet the critical acclaim generated by her releases has been more than enough to make a significant indent on the world of underground music. It almost feels wrong to conceptualise Rrose as part of the techno, ambient or indeed any other scene – the music operates right on the line of what is classifiable, and often crosses it with astonishing effect; the most notable example being the modern masterpiece, ‘Waterfall’.</p>\n<p>Debussy once wrote that the true purpose of music would be achieved “if [people] felt that for a moment they had been dreaming of an imaginary country, that’s to say, one that can’t be found on the map”. This is precisely what Rrose has achieved consistently – mapping the unmappable, through tripped out, psychedelic and sinister projections, executed with impeccable production. Rrose’s latest EP, <em>Eating the Other</em>, progresses the sound to a yet another new plain, this time more stark and bold than previous attempts.</p>\n<p>Opening with ‘Ammonia’, seductive and immersive synths beckon the listener into Rrose’s world with shamanistic pulses and a rushing static that never seems to cease its incline. However, It’s ‘Mirror’ that stands out as the real centrepiece of this EP; the interwoven textures and polyrhythms intoxicate the listener into a giddying headspace, like a score of strobes bursting their unique light at different speeds. The detailed tapestry of sound sways into peaks and plateaus of energy over a carefully constructed 11-minute narrative. Rrose’s production is more impressive than ever here, marrying traditional analogue sounds with an unmistakably modern sheen. ‘Pentagons’ closes the EP with many of the same questions left unanswered; aural paradoxes drive the track forward into disquieting and claustrophobic realms – listening to Rrose is often an experience in equal parts enticing and paralysing, as an intricate sonic web is spun around the listener.</p>\n<p>The title of the EP comes from Bell Hooks (note the R-shaped hooks on its cover, too) on the process of cultural commodification. And given the dizzying conceptual heights that Rrose aspires to, it sometimes feels as if this music would work better in the album format – akin to how artists like Actress and Demdike Stare have chosen to disseminate their productions. Nevertheless, these short bursts of considered releases that Rrose has delivered have maintained an important sense of obscurity achieved by very few producers working today – enlivening a whole new sound in a hypermodern manner.</p>\n<p>Catch Rrose performing live at Fabric tomorrow, <a href=\"http://www.fabriclondon.com/club/listing/921\">May 24th</a>.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Y6MFx8y-_98\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Established in 2012, the label has played host to a range of darkly textured, brooding warehouse tracks. Their latest release comes from Imago, a recently founded project comprised of three producers, who for now remain annonymous.</p>\n<p>In a sense the release is somewhat hard to place; on the one hand it has much in common with the high brow arts-techno of Stroboscopic Artefacts or Modal Analysis, yet on the other it also has much in common with the no-nonsense dancefloor offerings of Sleaze or Electric Deluxe. Take opening track ‘Downfall’; cloud-like atmospheres and scraping static introduce the track, yet are quickly forced into submission by the familiar march of 4/4 kick drums.</p>\n<p>The smoke-laced ‘Monk’ is reminiscent of Raime or Samuel Kerridge with crawling, blackened drones and achingly slow tribal drums. Trembling arpeggios are introduced as the track slowly mutates; the introduction of a stuttered hi-hat loop dragging the track’s lumbering bass work forward. The track makes a good summation of what the EP does best in the way it plays with pace and intensity, breezing between fist pumping warehouse techno and thick, fog-like ambience with little space between for the listener to take stock.</p>\n<p>Title track ‘Nocturne’ and follower, ‘Particle Of God’ combines several different approaches, creating two sonic-trips easy to become entranced by. Hissing pulses of white-noise and sombre melodies dance between one another, Imago’s lack of a steady snare rhythm letting the track glide, like a manta ray skimming the ocean floor.</p>\n<p>Closing track ‘Return’ feels similarly well suited to early-hour sets. An acid synth-riff gurgles beneath Imago’s cloying atmospheres and thudding drums, occasionally bursting through the mix in vicious contortions.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/35115724&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

The four monolithic pillars of the Øresund Bridge stand seven hundred feet tall, gradually eclipsing one another as the perspective shifts. In length, the structure runs just shy of twenty-six thousand feet, connecting the Swedish city Malmö with Denmark’s capital, Copenhagen - two locations central to the operations SonuoS Records co-ordinator Finn Albertsson.</p>\n<p>“Malmö has a very creative scene when it comes to new and interesting labels and artists” he responds when asked about the music scene of his hometown. “It’s buzzing with talented people making wicked music, and this has been going on for quite a while with artists like Rivet, Minilogue, KAB, Bauri, S.D.L, or Düsseldorf by Night just to name a few. The audience in Malmö however is a tad more afraid of what’s new and experimental compared to the artists and the labels in this town, but then again neither artists nor labels want to make it big in Malmö alone.”</p>\n<p>The same observation can be fairly applied to Albertsson himself both as a label owner and DJ, and is perhaps the reason why he makes the regular commute across the Øresund to neighbouring Copenhagen, where he performs as a resident DJ at Culture Box, a position earned deservedly through his unique approach to the art-form.</p>\n<p>&quot;I started to DJ with hard techno in the beginning of the 90’s but wasn’t any good at it really&quot; he begins when asked about his his origins as a disc jockey. &quot;Then in 1994 the drugs flooded the scene here in Malmö and the feeling was gone, no more natural joy just chemical. I began to play chill-out &amp; ambient dub as it was called back then in ‘94. I had my own night ‘Almost no tempo at Tempo’ at at a restaurant named Tempo Bar &amp; Kök every second Sunday for four years. Then I took a break from that for a while and then I had a club called ‘Chill out little square’ at the bar Röda Kran every Tuesday for some years.&quot;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5472/14321189212_27788636cf_z.jpg\" alt=\"CB\"></p>\n<p>As potentially Copenhagen’s leading venue for electronic music, his residency at Culture Box has propelled Albertsson’s reputation as a DJ, the position handed to him by co-owner of the venue, Kenneth Christiansen. “I first met Kenneth in 2005 when we played at the same party in Malmö, somehow he had heard about me and asked for my email so that he could book me to play at Culture Box” Albertsson divulges when asked about how the residency came about.</p>\n<p>“I played my first gig with Pete and René for their one year anniversary party, and to tell you the truth I didn’t connect the dots whatsoever, so I had my first gig at Culture Box with Substance &amp; Vainqueur behind the decks in total oblivion! Had I known I would have been so nervous. Since then Kenneth has spoiled me rotten with great gigs, I wouldn’t be where I am today if it wasn’t for him because after I started to DJ at Culture Box regularly I managed to get some really nice gigs in Malmö too thanks to Ulf at Kontra-Musik. Kenneth is a man with a very big heart, he’s the biggest facilitator in Copenhagen that I know of when it comes to taking new talent under his wings both with Culture Box and his labels to give them an extra push forward.”</p>\n<p>Listening to Albertsson mix, the consistency with which he is able to express his diverse, yet selective taste is impressive; a factor also evident in the curation of the label. “SonuoS started late 2012 and got served to me on a silver platter by Jimi Disko from Subwax Bcn, who offered me the opportunity to start the label” he explains of SonuoS’ foundation. “He pays for everything and when the break-even is met from sales me and the artists involved in each EP share the eventual profit. Jimi has a very long history of running both a record store and labels all the way back to the early ’90s. He opened up Subwax Bcn in Barcelona together with Stefan Eriksen two years ago. Subwax has a string of lovely House and Techno labels of their own plus that they take care of a lot of other labels’ distribution.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2937/14343176323_0133aceaf8_z.jpg\" alt=\"Sub\"></p>\n<p>The selection of artists chosen to release on the imprint seems to have proved where its greatest success lies, Albertsson favouring musicians based on the quality of their productions rather than the recognition they have achieved previously. “I have always been curious since I was a little boy, so more or less daily I’m online searching record distributors and music blogs for something that will surprise me sonically” he begins when asked about sourcing artists for the label. “I love finding new, highly creative and interesting artists with their own unique sound and that goes hand in hand with what I like to DJ with too. It’s a bit of a thrill for me finding new artists with a personal take on music that doesn’t care about trends or being commercial. I’ve been listening to electronic music more or less since 1974 when I first heard Kraftwerk’s ‘Autobahn’ - I’m electronically damaged for life to put it mildly and always in search of something new.</p>\n<p>The thing all the artists on SonuoS have in common is that they have their own sound and are highly creative in the process of making it - I like to set the standard high when it comes to artists being releases on the label. Sometimes I have to pinch myself because I can’tbelieve my luck being able to release so many fantastic artists.”</p>\n<p>Each release comes backed with a remix to add an extra variation, and as Albertsson states, the decisions he takes picking remixers are never taken lightly. “I like to complicate things so for me so it’s not easy to pick a remixer for a SonuoS release. I want the remixer to make a totally different kind of electronic music than the original artist or work in a completely different way and/or have another approach to their music making so that the remix <em>really</em> sounds remixed.</p>\n<p>I always listen to the original artists music a lot and then I try my level best to figure out who out there in the world of slow experimental electronic music could take it and give it a good stir and come up with something completely different but at the same time recognizable. I want the remixers to work hard and get a bit of a challenge and so far I’m pleased I must say.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/14136328229\" title=\"Wax by straylandings, on Flickr\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Wax\" src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5034/14136328229_3bb34d6f5c_z.jpg\" width=\"640\"/></a></p>\n<p>The carefully considered ethos around running the label even extends to the music’s tempo; submissions regulated between 35bpm &amp; 80bpm. “As a DJ I start to beat mix at 35bpm and I never go faster than 80 bpm, and I want my label to reflect that” he reasons about the decision. “Let’s be clear, I’m not talking about a straight 4/4 rhythm - if for example a track is built up with a syncopated rhythm that feels like 120 bpm I calculate it as 60 bpm. SonuoS isn’t a house or techno label and never will be, but if people can dance to the releases I don’t mind. So far it’s only the Yves De Mey remix of Valanx ‘Daughters Of The Everfire’ and Plaster’s track ‘Circular Mechanism’ that feel fast, but in fact they are just very well crafted syncopations with a strong groove.”</p>\n<p>With the next seven releases already finalised, it looks like this formula is working well, the fourth in the series written by a personal friend of Albertsson’s. “Fredrik Nilsson aka A.O.T is from Malmö too, living just a block away from me. I have known him for quite a while now; he’s always been making music but it’s only been two or three years now that he has decided to be serious about it. He’s not only very talented but also very productive having just released ‘The Echo’ on Vosnos Records, he’s going to release his Rundgång EP on SonuoS shortly, and he’s also got yet another 12” coming up on the new label ill. Not bad for a totally new artist I must say!”</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/99905543&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Providing the inaugural release for Ben UFO, Pangaea &amp; Ramadanman’s legendary Hessle Audio imprint would seem enough of a claim to success for most electronic musicians. For Romanian born Cosmin Nicolae aka Cosmin TRG however, this is just one of many examples of the staggering recognition of his craft, having released for the likes of Hotflush, 50Weapons, Tempa &amp; Hemlock Recordings previously.</p>\n<p>The range of different label’s that have played host to his productions suggest Nicolae has never had an issue with creative freedom, yet he has recently taken matters further into his own hands, setting up his own label, Fizic.</p>\n<p>With the first release on the imprint released recently and an upcoming show at Fabric tomorrow evening, we decided to catch up with Nicolae to discuss these topics, as well as photography, creative freedom and the changing Berlin landscape.</p>\n<p>**Hi Cosmin how are things? You’ve just got back from Australia recently after three gigs in two days. How did it go? **</p>\n<p>Always great fun down under, and this time was really special as I was part of this incredible line-up with Hot Chip, Matthew Dear and Xosar among others. We played two big shows in Melbourne and Sydney so there were some school trip moments when we really bonded. The crowds were great, promoters extremely nice, which made this whole “fly to Australia for two days” business seem like a decent thing to have done. I’m especially fond of the after-party I played in Melbourne, it was really fun to also play music that I rarely get to play.</p>\n<p><strong>I was reading your 2013 LWE interview - you mention wanting to reach a level of Zen where this kind of trip wouldn’t faze you after a similar trip to Melbourne for a few gigs. Any better this time round?</strong></p>\n<p>I somehow managed to pass out for most of my flight over there, which is no mean feat considering I never sleep. The way back, however, was a rite of initiation. There’s a slight sense of murderous paranoia when you wake up to realise you’re strapped in a seat on a bus with wings somewhere over the Pacific with twenty three hours left on it. So I guess that level of Zen is still something to look forward to.</p>\n<p><strong>You’re over to London for Fabric on the 21st as well, do you remember the first time you played the club? Any other artists your looking forward to seeing this time round?</strong></p>\n<p>Of course, Room 3 with Hessle Audio in 2009, very nice memories from that night of lots of friends coming to see me play there for the first time. I always look forward to checking out the other artists on the bill, obviously my Room 2 colleagues A Made Up Sound and Phon.o, also Craig Richards is always a great lesson in the craft. Heard tINI for the first time in Ibiza last year and she played some amazing tracks, so I look forward to her set as well.</p>\n<p><strong>The name for the new label, ‘Fizic’<em>,</em> comes from a track on your  album <em>Simulat</em>. Translated from Romanian this comes out as ‘looks’ or ‘appearance’, is this correct? What was the reason behind the title choice?</strong></p>\n<p>Used as a noun it does mean ‘appearance’, but I used it mainly as an adjective, as ‘physical’. Quite simply, the label is an extension of myself. A reflexion, if you will, the physical manifestation of  ideas and imagery in my head.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5557/14281783510_2a59ea4595_z.jpg\" alt=\"Fizic\"></p>\n<p><strong>The sleeves will all be photographs taken by yourself as well I believe, has photography been a passion of yours for a long time? With the first release how would you say the photo ties into your concept for the tracks?</strong></p>\n<p>I love photography, and for that reason I take very few pictures. I have a very different relationship with photography than other people I guess… I take a lot of time with the places or people that I want to photograph, to capture their essence. The best photos are the ones I haven’t taken… The one I took for the cover of my record is very special to me. It’s a concrete structure in the middle of nowhere, that I’d been waiting to photograph for most of my life.</p>\n<p>In a sense, it was like I appropriated that structure, made it a part of me by taking its picture. The tracks have something organic and also something distinctly alien, metallic in them, and that structure is a brutal intervention in nature - just connecting some dots here.</p>\n<p>**How far ahead do the plans for the new imprint stretch? Fizic is a platform just for your own productions I believe, what was the reason behind setting up the new label? The diversity of your previous releases suggest you didn’t have an issue with creative freedom on other labels (musically at least)! **</p>\n<p>Fizic is a platform for my ideas, it just seemed fitting to own an imprint and make something very personal out of it. I always had creative freedom everywhere I released in the past, so that was indeed not an issue. I just felt that it would make a lot of sense to start a channel to present my work, rather than use someone else’s, and to forge my own aesthetics.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think you’ll continue to release material with other label’s alongside the work you put out under the Fizic tag?</strong></p>\n<p>If the opportunity comes, I’m always open, there are still labels out there with whom I’d love to work, so I’m not crossing anything out.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s been about three years since your move to Berlin from Romania – have you noticed much of a change in the city in the time you’ve been there? What do you think the future holds for Berlin with the number of people moving over?</strong></p>\n<p>The city is very much its people - when they change, the city changes… I’ve only been here a short while, long-time residents can definitely see a change in attitudes, places disappearing to make space for other places, I guess it’s only natural. Thing with Berlin is, it has different gears, and you can adapt it to your lifestyle. If it’s 24hr partying you’re after, you’re going to get your fix. If you just feel like chilling out for a bit, you can even forget there’s a party somewhere. But there’s always a party somewhere… I think Berlin is undoubtedly going to get more gentrified, rents are on the rise, but there’s something very intangible about this city that won’t <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMr2uF498sc\" target=\"_blank\">change…</a></p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/30537359&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>When it comes to the Spanish Techno scene, you don’t have to do much digging before the name Christian Wünsch appears on your radar. Despite the fact the Monaco born producer has clocked up a staggering seventy plus releases over his two decade long career, it’s only recently that he has taken up the challenge of releasing an album, which comes in the form of <em>Internal Conversion</em>, a sweltering amalgamation of warped industrial timbres and long-playing warehouse techno. Released at the beginning of the month, the LP comes to light with the assistance of Wünsch’s close friend Oscar Mulero, who put the LP out on his legendary Pole Group imprint.</p>\n<p>With the album having been in the public domain for a couple of months now, we decided Wünsch would be a fitting candidate to inaugurate our new ‘That Time When’ feature - a series discussing five of the most memorable gigs (either as a DJ or a punter) with a range of different electronic artists.</p>\n<p>1# ##Detroit_2005##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3911/14521895645_5290e605b3_z.jpg\" alt=\"Detroit\"></p>\n<p>&quot;2005 was the first year I played in Detroit - it was one of the Movement Festival after parties. This was one of my favourite gigs ever; everything was as it should have been. The name of the event was &quot;Substance Detroit&quot; and it was ran by the people from ‘Friction Detroit’, who today also own the label Blank Code - they are really good friends of mine. The location of the party was awesome, it was in the first skyscraper that was ever built in Detroit; the building was totally abandoned, but the organisers did such a great job cleaning and decorating the place. I remember the walls were covered with black plastic and with very few lights - it had a real underground vibe. There were four rooms and an amazing sound system, all was perfect and the party was astounding! Difficult to forget.&quot;</p>\n<p>2# ##Sala_2001##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3917/14542008763_b454c7ddce_z.jpg\" alt=\"Slovakia\"></p>\n<p>&quot;Another great gig was the first time I played in Slovakia back in 2001 at the Metroklub in Sala. When I arrived at the party it was already crowded, the atmosphere couldn’t have been better, the sound was awesome and the people were going mad for the music, reacting to every record I played. The DJ box was like a cage, with metal bars separating me from the people. Slovakia was a fantastic discovery for me. Definitely one of my best nights!</p>\n<p>I can’t talk about Slovakia and not mention the best club in the world that was the infamous Uclub, located in a bunker left over from World War II, in the centre of Bratislava underneath a mountain were there was an old castle - an amazing spot. The club is still running. It used to be open every weekend, but the guys currently only do their parties one night a month. I’m not entirely sure why, it’s a shame it isn’t every weekend. Best crowd, best sound, best collectives running the club. It was my second home.</p>\n<p>I’ve never lived there, but back in the day I used to go over every two or three months. I’ve played almost every town in Slovakia and the Czech Republic - <em>that’s</em> why I consider it my second home. I made some very good friends there that I’m still in touch with today. A real techno crew!”</p>\n<p>3# ##Berlin_2005##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5237/14520481524_a77181f4c1_z.jpg\" alt=\"Berlin\"></p>\n<p>&quot;The closing party of the old Tresor was another one of my favourite gigs; sixteen nights with great line ups, with all the DJs and producer that had played before or had something to do with the label, and I was invited to play one night together with my friend Oscar Mulero - we had a wicked time. Tresor was one of my favourite clubs in Europe and playing at the closing party was super!</p>\n<p>That was the last time I played at Tresor - the <em>old</em> Tresor used to be my favourite club in Berlin, it was a very special club. The new one is also one of my top locations in Berlin, as well as Berghain of course.”</p>\n<p>4# ##Rio / São Paulo_2005##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3846/14518534981_2528291d80_z.jpg\" alt=\"Rio\"></p>\n<p>&quot;I have some really fond memories of the tour I did in Brazil. It was part of a mini-tour that I went on with Oscar [Mulero] called &quot;The Damage Done&quot;. We played in Rio and São Paulo, both gigs were excellent, totally different but both very cool - I think it was the beginning of 2005.</p>\n<p>In Rio it was a small club but with a really nice atmosphere, while in São Paulo it was a big open-air festival in a beautiful location surrounded by nature. The festival was packed out and had some really nice Brazilian vibes. We had an incredible experience and enjoyed the amiability of the people from the country. I also did a gig alone in Campo Grande which was very good too!</p>\n<p>Me and Oscar have been friends for about eighteen years now, I used to be a big fan of his (and still am today). I moved to Madrid to work in a record shop, this was when I started to sell Oscar’s records, and that´s how we met. Two years later I left the record shop and began to produce electronic music. After a few years, we started to collaborate on EPs and remixes and we’d often tour together, then finally we decided to start a new project. We decided to write some tracks together in the studio, and this is how “Spherical Coordinates” was born. Touring with Oscar is great, imagine traveling with one of your best friends.”</p>\n<p>5</p>\n<p>##Tokyo_2008##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3889/14335481407_ee62a28937_z.jpg\" alt=\"Tokyo\"></p>\n<p>&quot;Finally Japan in 2008 (I think). The first time I played Tokyo was a night to remember. Japanese people are so hospitable, I met a lot of cool, very nice people that took me to some wicked after-hours and looked after me very well. To play Tokyo was one of my ultimate goals so you can imagine how excited I was when this gig came though. My visit to Japan surpassed all my expectation, everything seemed fairly similar to Europe, nightclubs and afterparties running late into the days/nights.&quot;</p>\n",

The same stark, burbling tonal palette is put into play here; fractured drums clattering across groaning, mutant soundscapes. ‘Letch’ is a strong example; dial-up bleeps &amp; surging radio static slowly gather momentum behind nosediving drones.</p>\n<p>Where the melodies felt constrained by Metrist’s stunted rhythms through the Fifth Wall EP, here they are thrust into the foreground, despite the dousing of fuzz &amp; distortion which envelope them. The effect gives the EP the aesthetic of a low-budget ’90s sci-fi flick, ‘Symphony For The Palpatation’ feeling particularly filmic with its warbling crescendo’s and solemn, marching drums.</p>\n<p>The style is not dissimilar to that of Perc’s relatively recent <em>The Power And The Glory</em> LP; the barrage of thunderous metallic drums which run through ‘Cowlick’ case in point. Here melodic components at first appear non-existent as Metrist’s dense percussion clouds the track, yet as it develops warped, discordant riffs are slowly eased out of the samples. ‘Stanza For The Weak’ plays on a similar theme, a rollicking kick pattern thudding into place behind Neubauten style powerhouse drums and the ever familiar whine of steeply inclined drones.</p>\n<p>Their diversity has often has often been the most attention grabbing feature of Metrist’s prior releases. The strength of ‘The People Without’ however, instead comes from the way it lays out and maintains a single theme consistently. Somewhere in the mid-ground between these two approaches there’s a fantastic album waiting to happen.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/148165980&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

The album is a sincere sonic chronicle of his experience: footsteps and train noises mix with techno beats, giving the listener a glimpse of the German cityscape.</p>\n<p>Though paying homage to Berlin’s dub techno traditions, Wolzyn personalises <em>Intercity Express</em> by extensively featuring his collection of field recordings. Over the city clamour and pieces of broken dialogue, the beats develop smoothly as he alternately brings various intricate rhythmic patterns into the foreground.</p>\n<p>This continuum is broken – albeit only for a moment – in the third track ‘Intercity Express’. In the eight-minute long titular track, the beat pattern is intercepted by fifteen seconds of silence and misaligned entries before launching into a steady, danceable section filled with dark warm beats and synths. The beginning of the track seem almost like a error against the straightforward, pure techno, leaving the the listener suspended in silence.</p>\n<p>The short interlude track ‘Maschinenraum’ marks a departure from the rest of the LP: abrasive frequencies wildly pan for two minutes until they’re compressed into a dry, sparse spattering of noise. It’s a good primer for the ‘Drohnen über Karlsruhe’, with its lusciously wet beats. The production of ‘Drohnen’ stands out in particular, and unlike the first half of the LP, it features far more samples and beat patterns.</p>\n<p>At times the LP can feel like it’s been held back slightly; ‘Time To’ is a track unique in its use of vocals, yet the vocals feel almost like an afterthought: its sparse melody lines could easily be replaced by synthetic textures. This said, whilst Wolzyn may have restricted himself from indulging in any especially drastic experiments across the record, <em>Intercity Express</em> still manages to break beyond the traditional dub-techno format through it’s wonderfully creative use of sound-design, seamlessly fusing meticulous rhythmic progression with the mess and noise of Berlin.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/23849022&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

Take the title track of his latest Hypercolour released EP; ‘CC XX YY NNNNN’ has been floating about in mixes since at least 2012, featuring in McPhee’s Boiler Room debut. Rough-edged, bumping House grooves underpin the track, yet its minimal use of tonality places it in the realms of techno as much as anything else. A single, harshly filtered riff dances playfully in the backdrop before being shunted out of sight by McPhee’s creaking drones and stuttering vocal chops.</p>\n<p>If the original can be considered as McPhee’s attempt to strip the House format back as far as possible, Trevino’s interpretation is its full-fat alternative. Laced with funk-tinged melodic progressions and slinking drum machines, Trevino’s remix puts ‘CC XX YY NNNNN’ more in the context of heaving ’90s super-clubs rather than darkened techno basements.</p>\n<p>This shift in context doesn’t last long however, McPhee’s lurching ‘Branch’ calling to mind Matthew Herbert’s early productions with its pots and pans percussion and waltzing, light-footed rhythms. Closing the EP with a similarly illegible title, ‘DD YYY ZZ OOOOO’ feels downcast and reflective, tripped out tape echoes and abrasive dub-stabs working into a mesmeric pulse.</p>\n<p>In these assorted offerings Hypercolour have managed to pull together a release which encapsulates the charm held in much of McPhee’s work; dark, finely crafted House &amp; Techno, but with enough quirks and idiosyncrasies raise plenty of smiles, despite the often darkened aesthetics.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/38245956&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> Eat Concrete\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 01/07/2014</p>\n<p>Lumisokea’s latest offering brings together features of Europe’s past and future, comprised of sounds made by the innovative and futuristic ‘noise machines’ that Russian Engineerist Vladimer Popov designed in the early 20th Century. The Italian/Belgian duo recontextualise these bizarre acoustic sounds into highly charged tapestries of sound that are contemporary in style and antique in texture.</p>\n<p>Lumisokea curiously describe their work as “research into rhythm, synthesis and electro-acoustics”, rather than something primarily creative. This is an almost analytic and scientific notion of sound design, and this sense of ‘research’ rings true with much of their work, which focuses on industrial sounds and an achingly meticulous placement of percussion. This comes through perhaps most strikingly on ‘The Engineerist’, which opens the EP. Despite the organic and animate feel this track possesses, there are undeniably artificial elements to it as well, leaving the listener in awe of its complex inner workings. Where Shackleton goes to extraordinary lengths to ‘analogise’ digitally created beats, Lumisokea do the opposite, digitising and modernising traditional tones from over a century ago.</p>\n<p>The middle of the EP takes the sound to an eerier and more distant setting, showcasing the duo’s ability to create rich and immersive aural pictures. Littered throughout the EP there are also semblances of ultra-modern synthesizers, verging on the sort that one would find in the darker subgenres of Drum &amp; Bass such as Neurofunk and Techstep. In particular, ‘Rhythmicon’ compliments its jigsaw-like polyrhythms with unearthly rumbles and pulses, concluding the EP with an unmistakable contemporary finish.</p>\n<p>This EP is in part tribute to the progressive spirit of the Soviet inventors and composers who, despite social, political and economic hardship revolutionised the way in which music was created and heard. Lumisokea pay ample homage to this tradition, and leave the listener with many questions unanswered; how was it recorded, edited and performed? How were they programmed, how does one even ‘go about’ writing music like this given its complexity and nuance? It’s rare to find music that genuinely perplexes, but Lumisokea perplex with poise.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/35742175&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.fifthwallrecords.com/\">Fifth Wall</a>\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> 12”/Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 16/07/2014</p>\n<p>As co-owner of Fifth Wall, the Pinky Violence EP is not only a homecoming of sorts for NY resident Hound Scales, it also finds him looking to his immediate surroundings for inspiration. For a while now, a certain sound has been coalescing around the big apple - sludgy, low-slung House, loosely spearheaded by the label L.I.E.S. With the previous EP on Fifth Wall showcasing local talent (L’estasi Dell’oro, Loric, Shawn O’Sullivan &amp; Greg Z), there seems to be a pleasing sense of aesthetic alignment amongst this growing crop of NY Techno-heads.</p>\n<p>There has always been a stand-offish, punk mentality to the Fifth Wall output – nuggets from the EP’s press-release include: ‘Tearing down and rebuilding, the effect of world war on romantic relationships…’ and: ‘mother fuck Mark Wahlberg’. With an ethic-statement that admirably grandiose, it’s a good thing the city is catching a collective wind of inspiration. Accordingly, Pinky Violence sees HS down sticks from his usual cerebral thump: lowering tempos and upping the slinkiness, the resulting sound is sleazily inviting.</p>\n<p>Closing tracks ‘Youth Series (Rayon Dub 1)’ &amp; ‘Superior Headwraps (Rayon Dub 2)’ epitomise that sleaziness, the pair are carved out of a fuzzy tribal stomp that’s both sweatily primitive &amp; erotic. ‘Youth Series…’ takes the sculptors chisel to it’s murky bedrock of tape-saturated static, unplugged guitar noises and child-trapped-in-a-well vocal samples; somehow the outcome is both funky and elegant. ‘Superior Headwraps…’ successfully conjures the ghost of gristle past in it’s closing stages’ EBM swagger and rebellious attitude. It bookends the EP with a snippet of speech: ‘…a corporate arrangement of limbs and organs held together by it’s material support’ - also a good metaphor for the human, organic feeling that the lo-fi approach evokes.</p>\n<p>The one-two punch of ‘Spahnners (Rubble Dub 2)’ &amp; the accompanying remix from man-of-the-moment Tuff Sherm however provides the real backbone of the EP. The former’s intricately layered march of white-noise percussion and muttering vocalisations are submerged under it’s central bass-drone, balancing it’s intentionally anaemic mixdown with delicate, mournful chords that bring to mind early Autechre. The approach is less obviously ‘heavy’ than previous Hound Scales, and hints at new levels of psycho-acoustic depth to his work – an understanding that Techno shouldn’t only kill via repetitive bludgeoning. Programming the two tracks to be neighbours on the EP was an inspired touch – the ending of the first runs so smoothly into the opening chords of the second, that it feels like a reprisal. Sherm adds a hefty barrel of a kick; new melodic layers; cheekier swing; an unpredictable, alternating structure. Choosing TS for the remix was another effective choice – both artists are currently mining similar furrows &amp; there is a gleeful feeling of one-upmanship to his effort.</p>\n<p>As ever with Hound Scales &amp; Fifth Wall, the non-musical aesthetics are a scrambled mush of signifiers and allusions, including the title which refers to a pulpy sub-genre of Japanese exploitation-films within the ero guro tradition (erotic-grotesque); and the charming trademark that is Scale’s affinity with bracketed sub-titling when naming tracks. In all there is a growing deftness of construction, the addition of extra dimensions for Hound Scales to explore. That the EP contains stylistic divergence within it’s tracks, whilst retaining an overall feeling of cohesion, is the mark of an artist growing in both confidence and maturity.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Stroboscopic Artefacts has, with now eighteen instalments, relentlessly shifted the goalposts of contemporary electronic music to bold and unfamiliar territory. With contributions from the likes of Lakker, Rrose and Plaster – those are just from last year - the series has become somewhat emblematic of the progressive ethos of the label, developing, at least in my mind, a well-earned legendary status. Borrowing the term ‘Monad’ from abstract metaphysics should give some clue as to the mystifying style of the music. With each new instalment, fresh textures and ideas seem to appear, expanding the label’s sonic shores. Without overdoing it (too late?) the Monad Series has been a constant source of inspiration, and releasing exclusively in digital format has enabled the label to produce a vast quantity of these experimental releases in a short amount of time. The most recent of these comes from Sendai - collaborative project of Yves de Mey and Peter Van Hossen – and explores form limitlessly with a playful morphing of novel ideas.</p>\n<p>The EP kick-starts with a cluster of uncanny components: swamp-ridden bass, harmonic percussion, stifled kicks and growling strings. Sendai open their sonic toy box with wide-eyed, child-like wonder as each new element is brought to the fore; twisting, contorting, decontextualising and denaturalising each building block and clashing them against one another. A personal highlight, ‘False Entities’, hits the ear hard with bizarre glassy timbres and erratic rhythmic shifts. The meticulous attention to detail that Sendai proffer is endlessly engaging, with each motif made up of it’s own character and occupying a special place in the mix.</p>\n<p>The second half of the EP is situated within a more recognizable style; ‘Directive’ opens with vast 90’s-style pads, akin to the likes of Global Communication or LFO, before evolving into a heady and hypnotic kick pattern that sounds like a giant rubber band suspended overhead. By contrast, ‘Marten’s Deficit’ is the most dancefloor-ready of the bunch, unapologetically pounding each Exium-esque kick through the tight, vacuum-packed mix without a cigarette paper’s width between them.</p>\n<p>You may be surprised to hear that this is the first EP the duo have released in 5 years, given how prolific each respective member has been with their own projects. Nevertheless, with this EP and their latest LP, ‘A Smaller Divide’ both being released within three months of each other, this may be a sign that their best work is still ahead of us.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>A close, family ethos has always seemed to distinguish West Norwood’s best (and possibly only) House imprint WNCL from the crop. Label head Bob Bhamra’s signees rarely appear on the label as mercenaries - tending to work closely with WNCL across multiple releases. Perhaps best epitomising the ethic at the core of the label is the ‘We Are Family’ series, where frequent collaborators are invited to reinterpret one another’s work.</p>\n<p>With the second in this series available imminently, we decided to let Mr. Bhamra exchange thoughts with another featuring artist, J.Tijn, on beards, babies and jumping on the Outsider House bandwagon.</p>\n<p><strong><em>WEST NORWOOD CASSETTE LIBRARY INTERVIEWS J.TIJN</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>WNCL: I thought I’d kick off with one of the more pressing issues of our times. Why does everyone in techno have a beard these days?</strong></p>\n<p>J TIJN: We’re secretly all just lazy, it’s pure coincidence that having a beard is cool now. You’ll be next.</p>\n<p><strong>WNCL: It won’t happen (although my anti-beard stance is rooted in my failings to grow a full one). Your earliest musical associations were with Anti-Social Entertainment, known for their leanings towards the more soulful side of 140bpm dubstep. Do you ever get any flak for your move away from the dubstep scene, which can be notoriously die-hard or do you still have a foot in that camp / affection for that music?</strong></p>\n<p>J TIJN: Not really, my dubstep was terrible. I didn’t have a clue what I was doing and I didn’t release any records so I don’t think anybody was bothered. As for ASE that’s something I’ll always be involved with as long I’m friends with those guys. That’s what it’s about really, a group of friends that make music. I get that people know it for the soulful stuff but if Silkie/Quest/Jay 5ive/Rekta…. decided they hated chords and only wanted to make rhythmic noise for the rest of time that would be fine (I for one would encourage such a move).</p>\n<p><strong>WNCL: Second that. Here’s hoping you’ll be able to convince them. What do you think of the latest wave of instrumental Grime / Grime influenced tracks? Do you think there’s anyone out there doing it with enough conviction or is it just another ‘revival’? With your background, you would seem well qualified to integrate those motifs into a techno template. Is that something you’re interested in?</strong></p>\n<p>J TIJN: I think a lot of it harks too much back to 2003/2004 but there are exceptions. Mumdance, JL Sanders, Impey, Logos, Mike Midnight off the top of my head are all doing interesting stuff based around Grime (in varying degrees). It’s not really something I’ve consciously tried to do much, and when I have it’s sounded crap. I do think though that, because I was into Grime so much and at such an important time in my musical development, it will always be there in some way - same goes for the soulful 140 stuff mentioned before.</p>\n<p><strong>WNCL: From the recent batch of trax you’ve been sending over, amongst the heavy techno stompers that you’re known and loved for, it sounds to me like you’re exploring different styles or searching for something. Is that true and if so, what are you looking for?</strong></p>\n<p>J TIJN: I’m really trying to jump on the Outsider House thing right now mate. But no, seriously, I don’t think I’m trying anything particularly different to what I have been the last year but I’m finally turning out tracks that I’m happy with in styles I couldn’t quite nail before. I’ve been trying to make House even longer than I have Techno but the two are starting to merge in the things I’m making now.</p>\n<p><strong>WNCL: Haha! Well somebody needs to jump on Outsider House, that’s for sure. It’s interesting to note that you’re efforts at making House music predate your Techno releases. On first hearing the lead track on your WNCL EP, “Flat”, the execution suggested to me that this was someone that wasn’t chancing their arm at something outside of their perceived safety zone. We know about your early grime and dubstep connections - what other musical passions outside of techno do you have that might surprise people?</strong></p>\n<p>J TIJN: Brazilian music, all of it, it’s all bloody great.</p>\n<p><strong>WNCL: Especially the sounds of sobbing schoolboys in a 7/1 time signature. As you know, I was the unashamed World Cup tourist this year, whereas it’s evident from your Twitter feed that you’re an ardent follower of the game. As you also know, I’ve never tweeted before in my life. You tweet a lot and sometimes I read them because I like to know where you are at all times. Does this kind of exposure to the universe bother you?</strong></p>\n<p>J TIJN: Hahahaha, yeah I love football and I’ve been particularly active on Twitter during World Cup matches. I don’t think it’s difficult to spot that most of what I say on there is a pisstake so it doesn’t really bother me that it’s all public. Hopefully we’ll get you on there one day, strictly for promotion I mean, obviously.</p>\n<p><strong>WNCL: I think the chances of me joining Twitter are about the same as me growing a full beard. But anyway … back to the tracks. You’ve been sending me material for quite a few years now. Was there a particular track or artist from the WNCL roster that prompted you to get in touch?</strong></p>\n<p>J TIJN: Yeah Locked Groove linked me to a Knowing Looks track, which I can’t remember now, but that was my introduction to the label.</p>\n<p>**WNCL: I’m guessing that it would have been one of the tracks on <a href=\"http://westnorwoodcassettelibrary.blogspot.co.uk/2011/03/wncl004-in-shops-now.html\">WNCL004</a> in that case. Nice. **</p>\n<p><strong>You’ve put out material on a number of labels now that all release on vinyl. Without wanting to get into the tired old vinyl vs digital debate, I know that your preferred medium when you DJ is USB sticks. Is having a vinyl release a deal breaker for you when you sign to a label or are you not fussed?</strong></p>\n<p>J TIJN: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzRxxKW2eSA\">Found it</a>.</p>\n<p>For me it’s not so much about one or the other, they’re both important and I wouldn’t do a digital only release or a vinyl only release. They’re both deal breakers I guess. There’s nothing more annoying for me than hearing something amazing and not being able to play it because of the format. I can imagine it’s the same for guys who play vinyl with digital only releases. Best to do both and avoid that altogether I think.</p>\n<p><strong>WNCL: Ah yes - Ghost Baby. Proper nutcase vibes. And a handy way to plug both Knowing Looks releases in one interview. Wise words on the format front too. I think that’s my lot…</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5566/14632386957_9730d52f9f_z.jpg\" alt=\"WNCL\"></p>\n<p><strong><em>J. TIJN INTERVIEWS WEST NORWOOD CASSETTE LIBRARY</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>J TIJN: OK, cool. Only one place to start really. You’ve recently become a dad (congrats!), It’s still early but in what way(s) can you see that changing the way you approach what you do in music going forward?</strong></p>\n<p>WNCL: Thanks, J. I’m entering week two of fatherhood so it’s difficult to say right now. I gather from other friends who are DJ’s / producers / label owners with young families that it can all still be done but some focus is required - free time is precious and should be used wisely, that sort of thing. If that’s the case then it’s no bad thing. I’ve been procrastinating over nothing special in the studio for far too long over the last couple of years. I could do with a kick up the arse, frankly.</p>\n<p><strong>J TIJN: Was hoping for a “Wait! Trance IS amazing!!!” epiphany to be honest but there’s still time. You’ve also been into a variety of different dance music styles over the years. What would you say, looking back, was your favourite one?</strong></p>\n<p>WNCL: Haha! I’m sorry to disappoint you again, J. I promise that I will set up a trance appreciation twitter feed for hirsute football fans soon. So far, I’m happy that I’ve managed to get a stint in on deck and knock up a bass line in the studio with Ivy in one hand. She’s responding well to Kerri Chandler in particular. Train ‘em up young, innit?</p>\n<p>As for a favourite style of dance music - I’ve always had real problems pledging my allegiance to one genre or favouring one over the other. House music was / is / always will be a foundation for me just because I was the right age at the right time when it hit this country and, despite many, many fallow periods, it still manages to shine through in some way or other. On the other hand, if you get me started on late 80’s hip hop or early 90’s hardcore, we could be here for a while…</p>\n<p><strong>J TIJN: I’m all ears…</strong></p>\n<p>WNCL: I wonder how best to do this without sending you to sleep. Suffice to say that all these genres end up feeding into each other. Around ‘87, I got the hip hop bug - the stuff with heaps of samples before the music lawyers got involved. Fast forward a few years and those very same import 12&quot;s were getting sampled at 45rpm and hey presto, you’ve got hardcore. We’ll have to save the bits in between for our next session down at The Blue Posts over a couple of cold ones.</p>\n<p><strong>J TIJN: Haha that leads very neatly onto something else I wanted to cover… Practically everybody on the WNCL roster knows that The Blue Posts in Soho is where it’s at. Tell the people dem why they ought to ditch their local and drink in there from now on.</strong></p>\n<p>WNCL: It’s not always possible to meet everyone on the label because they are scattered all over the world, but when it’s feasible, I’ll always suggest a pint at The Blue Posts - a much nicer way to cook up the plans for a new release. It’s one of the few real boozers left in Soho, unaffected by any trendy comings and goings, dirty carpets and all. It’s true to say that it has become the unofficial HQ for WNCL business purely based on that fact that it’s my local and I’m lazy - it’s conveniently situated around the corner from the Verso office (where I work by day) and next door to Sounds of the Universe record store (where I spend most of my lunch hours…and wages).</p>\n<p><strong>J TIJN: As you mentioned there are folks on the label from all over the world. Would you say there are any main stylistic differences between the London-based artists and those from further afield?</strong></p>\n<p>WNCL: I may be too close to it to be objective but I don’t think so. If I didn’t know the facts before hand, judging the music alone, I wouldn’t be able to pinpoint your sound to West London or Don Froth’s to LA. The common thread with all the artists on the label (and the thing that I enjoy most about their music) is that everyone is pretty headstrong - doing their own thing with a healthy disregard for what anyone else is doing or what’s considered trendy. Geographic location would appear to have no affect on the output.</p>\n<p><strong>J TIJN: Does having artists all doing such different stuff on the label make it hard to find releases that fit together, or is it really just a case of putting out whatever you personally like?</strong></p>\n<p>WNCL: Very much the latter. I really like labels with a singular focus and easily identifiable sound - I’m quite jealous of them, really - but it just doesn’t suit me to do it so I follow my instinct. Luckily, I’ve had good support and encouragement in the past with distribution etc, giving me the confidence to carry on representing my personal taste with the label. Other people tell me that, despite the varying styles between releases, they can see how it all fits together. I couldn’t put my finger on a “WNCL Sound” but I sort of know what they mean. It all makes sense to me, of course, because these are all records I would have in my collection regardless of what label they were released on.</p>\n<p><strong>J TIJN: How does that work with your own music? You’ve released some of your own stuff on WNCL Rec. but have also released with other labels. How do you decide out of your own stuff what fits the label and what doesn’t?</strong></p>\n<p>WNCL: As I’m sure you can testify, when it comes to putting out someone else’s material on WNCL, I’m an extremely fussy bastard. Everything has to be right. We both have to be in love with the tracks. The track titles, running order and all manner of other trivia have to be just so. It’s hard enough putting someone else through that, almost impossible to apply the same (if not higher quality) filter to my own stuff. Despite my original intentions with the label, I’ve actively tried to avoid it becoming a vanity project and so I try not to flood the release schedule with my own stuff. I’m also very conscious of not spreading myself too thin outside of the label - I’ve put stuff out on a very small number of labels where there’s a mutual interest and respect for each other’s work.</p>\n<p><strong>J TIJN: Haha yeah, it’s difficult but ultimately I can imagine it’s worth it when you can look back over the catalogue with no regrets. You mentioned before that you got into House around the time it came to the UK (would that be '88-ish?) How long after that was it until you started making stuff of your own?</strong></p>\n<p>WNCL: It must have been '87 - obviously, I would have only about three years old then, if anyone asks - because the record that did it for me (and for hundreds and thousands of others) was Phuture’s “Acid Tracks”. I’ll admit that, before hearing that record, I wasn’t completely feeling the House stuff that I was hearing - it was all plastic pianos and vocals to my ears. I was more interested in the booming, jump up Hip-Hop records that were coming out at the same time. So, acid really did it for me and then I went back and scooped up what I’d been missing out on - pretty much anything on Trax and DJ International with that raw, basic production that has very much made it’s presence felt again over the last couple of years.</p>\n<p>It took me ages to try my hand at actually making tracks. I was still trying to work out how these people were getting two records to play together in time let alone getting my head around being in a studio. And, it goes without saying that, what followed, were years and years of the most embarrassing excuses for music that you’ve ever heard!</p>\n<p><strong>J TIJN: Where these embarrassing excuses for music House? I think I remember you mentioning you put a Jungle record……</strong></p>\n<p>WNCL: Yeah, the stuff that’s locked away are all cassette demos and you could loosely call it House music, at a stretch! By the time anything was put out on vinyl, around 96, I would have been a lot happier with the output. Although, listening back, most of it hasn’t dated very well at all. The jungle record was Plastic Soul (me and my friend Paul) - I guess people were calling it Drum &amp; Bass by then - and came out on Flex in '97. I still like that one. Paul and I recently dusted down the moniker for a House EP on WNCL. Two records in almost twenty years. I told you I wasn’t bothered about being prolific, didn’t I?</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/155129602&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Occupying a territory not-quite-techno, yet not wholly unfamiliar to the dancefloor, the productions of Berlin based ‘rkss’ have a highly distinct feel to them; perhaps ode to his unique approach to sampling. “I focus a lot on textures when I listen to music” he states when asked about his production process. “Though I do think some machine made music is great, we currently live in era where we can take <em>any</em> sound and turn it into something completely different. My friend showed me this essay John Cage wrote in the 1930s, which discusses how in the future people “will be faced with the entire field of sound”, among other things. Pretty much everything in that essay blew my mind and I still find very inspiring. As for more musical or aesthetically sources, I suppose anything I’m listening to at the time funnels into the music. Not consciously, but it ends up in there.”</p>\n<p>His latest offering, the Reject &amp; Fade released ‘Tunnel’ EP is testament to this, using randomly generated source material throughout the EP. “For my first EP, ‘Basement’, my sound source was all from one film - all micro samples. Similarly I used this technique for ‘Tunnel’, except this time I used Youtube samples. To be more specific I used this amazing <a href=\"http://www.youtuberandomvideo.com\">website</a>, which simply generated random youtube videos. As one would make field recordings of ambient sounds or real life, I did the same thing in this digital domain, of listening and cutting up random content people were putting on Youtube. All I can say is there are a lot of bodybuilders on Youtube.”</p>\n<p>Having sent over a selection of material to Reject &amp; Fade curator Michael Hann, it wasn’t long before plans for a fully-formed release began to take shape. “I really respected his taste and wanted to get his opinion on some stuff I had been working on” he says of their initial discussions. “He asked me to create a release for the label he was starting up. I was getting really into just sampling random things I was finding on Youtube and the internet in general - I wanted to explore this aesthetic further, so I set myself the aforementioned parameters. For me it was a success because you really can make something interesting out of anything, if you choose to. And I think the overall music has a certain and specific aesthetic, related to its sound origins, which is what I was hoping.”</p>\n<p>Covering a range of the material he was listening to during the record’s inception, rkss’ mix for us charts an hour and twenty minutes of tripped out House, Techno and Electronica.”I feel that the album itself is a little bit all over the place” he explains. “At least relative to traditional techno or dance record, with high and low BPMs and some non-traditional rhythms, but its interesting to see a little bit of all of these elements were present in the mix. Which is to say I can see in hindsight how this music effected my music at the time.”</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Before I Leave - Fennesz [Editions Mego]</li>\n<li>Untitled 1 - Terrence Dixon [Subspec]</li>\n<li>Étude élastique - Bernard Parmegiani [Editions Mego]</li>\n<li>Autumn in New New Canaan - Lejsovka &amp; Freund [Bark &amp; Hiss]</li>\n<li>Germany - Developer [???]</li>\n<li>III - HOLOVR [Opal Tapes]</li>\n<li>Harmony - A i w A [Farbwechsel]</li>\n<li>The Kettle Men - Actress [Honest Jon’s Records]</li>\n<li>Prism - Tim Hecker [Kranky]</li>\n<li>Disgust - Kerridge [D/N Records]</li>\n<li>Pretentious Alexipharmic Acid &amp; x0xb0x Doom Metal - Jesse Osborne-Lanthier [Hobo Cult Records]</li>\n<li>Actio Reactio - Helena Hauff [Werk Discs]</li>\n<li>Yayla - Rezzett [The Trilogy Tapes]</li>\n<li>Velvet Painting Of A Tiger Ortiz - Dynooo [self-released]</li>\n<li>Il Capoline - Madteo [Sähkö Recordings]</li>\n<li>The Beckoner - Minor Science [The Trilogy Tapes]</li>\n<li>Sunday Hotel - Moodymann [KDJ]</li>\n<li>A Crippled Left Wing Soars With the Right (Steal This Record remix by DJ Sprinkles) - Terre’s Neu Wuss Fusion [Skylax]</li>\n<li>3001AB - Huerco S.

    "content": "<p>Sticky Mike's Frog Bar is named after a famous Manhattan basement venue. Incidentally, it also has quite a sticky floor, alongside some pretty low ceiling beams which have probably been the cause of an aching head more often than the alcohol. Whilst all this may be true, it isn't enough to stop the seaside venue from occupying a special place in my heart, namely due to all the weird and wonderful shit they are willing to play host to. Either under the current title or former guise as 'The Jam', we've seen the basement bar occupied by Japanese psychedelic groups, footwork DJs (accompanied by those crazy-legged dancers) and some of the more adventurous strands of the dubstep scene a few years back.</p>\n<p>The award for the most avante-garde event I've seen at the venue however should arguably go to Cutting Room &amp; Voyder's recent event, bringing the now Berlin residing Dead Fader back to his previous home city, alongside K (no o), Nolan Dialta, and err... Shitwife.</p>\n<p>Listening through Cutting Room Records' discography or weekly radio shows it quickly becomes clear their approach to electronic music is pretty unique - noise, drone and techno influences are crossed with the wild flair of punk and metal. Stepping into the darkened basement of SMFB it didn't take long to realise this vibe would be carried into the evening - looking past the silhouetted figures, Nolan Dialta could be seen inclined over various machines, conjuring up vapourous atmospheres and grating drones to introduce the evening.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/15073981051\" title=\"Shitwife by straylandings, on Flickr\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/15073981051\" title=\"Shitwife by straylandings, on Flickr\"><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5575/15073981051_e33023c112_z.jpg\" alt=\"Shitwife\"></a></p>\n<p>K (no o)'s violent amalgamation of noise &amp; techno followed, the Brighton based producer giving little build up, instead pelting a medley of distorted, off-kilter drums and wildly oscillating bass in the face of the audience. The impact of this was incredibly physical - testament to the force of K (no o)'s warped production as much to the surprising weight of the venue's sound system.</p>\n<p>Where intensity is concerned however, you'd be hard pressed to deny the presence held by London based duo Shitwife. &quot;This next one is our take on gabber&quot; they announced at one point before launching into a barrage of breakneck drums and raw, discordant synth work. More than anything else, Shitwife are a great deal of fun to watch live, and it's hard not to raise a smile at the level of energy they bring even if the performance might leave your ears ringing.</p>\n<p>Following this headliner and Robot Elephant signee John Cohen took to the stage under his Dead Fader guise, presenting a live interpretation of material from his recent albums <em>Scorched</em> and <em>Blood Forest</em>, again with a contagious level of energy. Music with such strong dynamics and fluidity is well suited to the live format, filling every inch of space with snarling low-end and spaced out melodies.</p>\n<p>The whole experience essentially reminded me how much I miss going to gigs and not knowing quite what to expect; feeling scared or out of depth, experiencing sounds which are alien and exciting. This spirit felt very much alive throughout the gig - here's to hoping there are a few more on the horizon.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Dscrd - pronounced ‘discordance’ - have, with just a handful of releases, generated a significant buzz around themselves. In particular, their contribution to Stroboscopic Artefact’s legendary Monad Series, and their latest EP, ‘Panopticon’, forged a space for the group beyond the reach a single, definable genre, teasing out fresh flavours alien to the ear.</p>\n<p>Ahead of their performance at Berlin Atonal next week, we spoke to the quintet about the festival, political complacency, post-structuralism and ‘the rave’.</p>\n<p><strong>So how has 2014 been for you guys so far? How have things changed since the release of your Panopticon EP?</strong></p>\n<p>As expected, nothing really changed since the release of the Panopticon EP except the fact that we now have two new comments on our RA page debating how shitty our band name is. More seriously, we’ve had some very nice gigs this year in amazing places, and met some very interesting people - like at Strichka Festival in Kiev where we were warmly welcomed regardless of how tough and sad the situation has been for Ukrainian people recently. We actually like thinking that releases like our last EP help us grow and give us the chance to play on famous stages such as Strichka or Atonal festival. So we are in fact pretty much pleased with our current situation - May 2014 ends up in noise and trance.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you first meet, and at what point did you start producing together?</strong></p>\n<p>All this started in the south of France. We were three at the beginning; childhood friends who used to make music together and play with some very cool and colourful music software that sounded like plastic shit. Some years later, we met again in Paris as everybody moved there for different reasons like finding work, studying, seeking beautiful girls, becoming rich and famous … All of that failed more or less, but we met the two other guys (the north team) in very strange circumstances and we never quit with each other.</p>\n<p>We slowly developed the concept all together, upgrading our production techniques as they were intriguing with their shiny microphones, and our path crossed the road of some other enraged activists that invited us to join our forces with them. The first was the SNTWN Crew, and they let us deploy our early singular beats in front of their young crowd. We instantly became very good friends in our desperate quest. They are quite unavoidable now in the Parisian Scene, because they were and are still pushing some next level music that is really refreshing. A couple of years later, we were introduced by Voiski (Polar Inertia) to Heartbeat from the fresh and young label DEMENT3D. They were the first ones who really understood the sense of what we were doing so far, and we were very impressed by their aesthetics. That was really important motivationally, and we had our first EP.</p>\n<p><strong>I find the live dimension of your work intriguing; unlike most artists working in a similar vein, I understand you work with some improvised and live elements both on stage and in the studio. Can you explain, for instance, how you go about recording a track like ‘L’Etale’?</strong></p>\n<p>The main lead of _L’Etale, _this abstract high larsen slowly evolving from a tiny white noise to an almost pure sine, was for instance recorded by tweaking an old Tascam DAP-1 recorder; it was then edited and mixed on the track, at the same time helping to forge its narrative structure. Actually almost all tracks start with fresh sound design material. The source is a wild mix of processes such as the one described above. It is then a perpetual exchange between the beat, the atmospheres, leads, punctual edited sound design and so on until the track receives its final form. This is quite a natural workflow in our opinion, since we play live performances and produce tracks in the studio with the same gear, allowing for a lot of improvisation and instant creation.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you manage the creative input and influence of five different people? Is it always a collaborative effort or do you produce things individually and bring them to the group?</strong></p>\n<p>As we are all nearly the same age, we have grown up in the same culture. There are actually loads of topics that interest us every day.</p>\n<p>Music: Constantly inspired by the works of the masters, classic, acoustic, early electronic and experimental music from past decades as well as the fresh stuff - the darkest and weirdest electronic performances to the very straight techno stuff happening these days.</p>\n<p>As well as subversive literature, we are passionate about science and technology, in a technical and philosophical way.</p>\n<p>This mix of interests is the source of rich debates and inspirations, and the challenge here is to stay focused on a unique direction, for the band and for our projects. Sometimes it can be overwhelming, and sometimes it can flow naturally. This brings complexities that slow down the workflow a bit, but at the end, that’s an acceptable trade off for an exhaustive exploration of our five universes.</p>\n<p><strong>What can we expect to hear from you at Atonal festival?  Who are you most looking forward to seeing at the festival this time around?</strong></p>\n<p>Some noises for sure! To be honest Atonal this year is full of new faces for us and we’re proud to be part of that, but Atonal 4D is definitely what sounds like the more exciting event for French acousmatic music lovers. We’re looking forward to see what Murcof is going to perform with such a terrific installation!</p>\n<p>**How have you found different crowds responding to your live performances? Do you feel more comfortable playing to a Berlin crowd, than say, in your hometown Paris? **</p>\n<p>The crowds of Paris and Berlin are really different in essence. From the beginning we were often considered a UFO in most parties we did in our hometown, except for one or two concerts where we were more in our element, with a set sized for the occasion. Generally speaking, the crowd is younger and more excitable in France, with less tolerance for experimental sounds. We experienced situations where a bunch of guys, totally toasted, were standing in front of us, insulting and yelling for some house music.</p>\n<p>We have nothing against house but that is the kind of situation where you need a lot of self control to avoid a punk style finale where all the gear flies in their direction! On the other end, we are less experienced with gigs in Berlin, but we noticed an important maturity in the crowd. People here are more curious and accept a wide variety of performance. Berlin Atonal is the confirmation of that feeling.</p>\n<p><strong>Your latest EP has strong nods to Foucault, and I’ve read that you intend to use these political ideas to enrich and narrativize the music rather than to promote one ideology over another. Can you expand upon this a little? Why Foucault?</strong></p>\n<p>The book of Foucault speaks about the carceral world from the early days of Western civilisation. While it was not interesting to extract the entire narrative aspect for this work, we focused on a small but meaningful part of the book: the surveillance and of course the panopticon. It inspired us because of the aesthetics, but also because the symbol is singularly resonating with the recent revelations on the NSA activities. Foucault is a great thinker of the modern world, and his work is essential to understand many aspects of our civilisation, especially the darkest.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4300/35256207303_1091e2dd69_z.jpg\" alt=\"G\"></p>\n<p><strong>With the reintroduction of electronic music into mainstream culture, do you think there has been a decoupling of electronic music from its anti-establishment political origins in recent years?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s really difficult to say. If mainstream means all the soup of summer festivals where over young people are waiting to receive a pie in there face from a DJ playing pre-mixed shit on a USB key, we can consider that there is still a high level of implication from recent underground electronic musicians. On the other end, everything is so standardized as an industry now, particularly in London and Berlin, with this supply chain of booking/promotion/clubs… We sometimes have the feeling that the electronic music scene has nothing to envy over other industries in terms of corporate organisation (except the capital maybe …). Nothing is really going in the direction of political revendications, it is mainly a matter of aesthectics and hype of the moment. Also, we think it is somewhat logical that underground musicians having worldwide success cannot be associated with the real and only political act of in the electronic music now: the rave.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you think format falls into this? Do we have an obligation to keep record stores in business, or should we embrace the digital-format industry model?</strong></p>\n<p>As everybody knows, the digital music industry is led by questionable interests as pretty much every kind of industry and businesses in the world is. The vinyl format proves that there are still a bunch folks that aren’t willing to fully embrace the industry standards; each format is worth using for the sake of music and knowledge.</p>\n<p><strong>On your Resident Advisor biography, you state; “[w]e are activists for an “open” experimental music” – what do you mean by “open” here? Which parameters do you think experimental musicians should try to break down? Are there any?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s funny you’re mentioning this old biography written maybe six years ago when we were starting to play together, who knows what “open” meant to us then - for sure some juvenile excitement, maybe we were just alluding to this trend to oppose digital in favour of analog in music production.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally, what have you got planned for the future? Any exciting projects you can tell us about?</strong></p>\n<p>We plan to work with Stroboscopic Artefacts on a various artists release for the end of the year, and maybe some other things but it’s still unofficial!</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/25245564&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>There are few who manage to carve such an individual path as unflinchingly as Ben Lukas Boysen, otherwise known as Hecq. Across the veteran producer’s decade spanning career, we have seen him reinvigorate the dubstep blueprint, approaching it from a noise &amp; glitch-tinged perspective, also managing to produce some stunning ambient records under his birth name, without losing grip his signature style.</p>\n<p>With ‘Conversions’ - a new LP remixing material a startlingly wide-range of sources due for release imminently, we decided to invite Boysen to share five of his most memorable gigging experiences for our ‘That Time When’ series.</p>\n<p>1# ##Prague_2012##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3899/14895642546_7f19641b12_z.jpg\" alt=\"lunchmeat\"></p>\n<p>A wonderful, friendly crew organised a really impressive and creative event - Lunchmeat. Meeting Florence there for the first time and to have my set accompanied by her amazing, installation-esque visuals was something i will not forget. The audience set off a really unique atmosphere and i got to see one of my all time role models DMX Krew for the first time ever! I always loved how consequent and stylistically spot on DMX Krew was (and is). His music just hits a certain nerve with me that I always loved a lot - even though (maybe especially because) it’s very different from what I’d do.</p>\n<p>I hope I do Florence’s work justice when I say that it’s highly sculptural - very geometric and in the best way possible, reduced. In our case she focused on a highly interesting, as I’d like to call it, ”collage of light”. She built triangular screens that expanded the stage into something very tangible and impressive. If you check out her <a href=\"http://florence-to.com/\">website</a> you’ll see what I mean, and many other of her great projects.</p>\n<p>To be honest, I did not know about the degree of customisation Florence put into the visuals, even though we talked about it on Skype before. I adjusted my set mostly to the rest of the line up before leaving for Prague. Once I arrived, seeing the installation, I felt like I wanted to do some justice to her work and added, removed, changed tracks from the setlist.</p>\n<p>2# ##Hamburg_2010##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3923/14895661386_6befecba12_z.jpg\" alt=\"Goldenpudel\"></p>\n<p>I played with Wisp that night at Golden Pudel, a club I never saw before and honestly had by concerns about (a feeling I shared with a few artists as I heard afterwards), but the second the first set started these concerns were shattered!</p>\n<p>A very packed and extremely grateful crowd filled the room with energy, and gave an amazing response. It was as funny and otherworldy as it was entertaining - and the trip from Berlin to Hamburg that was connected with this evening was one of the most hilarious times I had getting from one town to another. It was a good trip with some very nice people - especially meeting Reid (Wisp) for the first time and getting along very well (even though I have a hard time thinking about who wouldn’t get along with him).</p>\n<p>3# ##Lyon_2011##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3888/14732046077_a1d165b7c9_z.jpg\" alt=\"riddim2013\"></p>\n<p>I played Riddim Collision whilst doing a two-gig mini tour through France, we (as in the Ad Noiseam crew) had a blast. Both evenings were very different from the gigs in Berlin i.e. the acts playing were Matta, Bong Ra, Mobthrow, Enduser, Nicolas Chevreux and myself. Matta and me played a DJ set back to back - which I had never done before and actually made me pretty nervous, but the resulting two hour set was extremely entertaining and fun!</p>\n<p>Most of the artists on Ad Noiseam (or especially that particular group) have known each other for a long time and this always contributes to a good time. I met James and Andy of Matta for the first time there, who turned out to be lovely company as well, so basically it all felt like a weekend family trip…. only a lot louder.</p>\n<p>4# ##Moscow_2012##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3914/14895717586_0d769526e2_z.jpg\" alt=\"16tons\"></p>\n<p>16 Tons was a really special night for me since it was not only my first gig in Russia but also I was supposed to share the stage with Andy Stott, and was looking forward to that a lot. Unfortunately Andy missed his connection and couldn’t play - I offered to cover his time which gave me a chance to play through a lot more styles as well as a chance to play through my own releases into a DJ set, from Ambient to Breakcore. An event I won’t forget!</p>\n<p>I really loved it there. Moscow’s incredibly pretty and, needless to say, offers some of the best beer around. It wasn’t my first (or last) time there and I will surely go back as there’s a lot to explore.</p>\n<p>I’m really more of a hermit than a stage person. I prefer being in my four walls - writing and producing in general. This does not mean that I don’t enjoy the gigs I play. I just see a difference between stage and studio personalities… and I’m more of a studio personality. I love the energy that can be created at a gig, the people, the atmosphere….needless to say. Also I’m always thankful that people consider me worth listening to for an hour or more - this won’t stop to amaze me. Traveling does not necessarily influence my work directly but the feel and atmosphere of every place I go to leaves a mark. So in the long run it will find its way into my production.</p>\n<p>#5 ##Oberhausen_2012##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3904/14732117868_1c18750b58_z.jpg\" alt=\"maschinenfest\"></p>\n<p>Maschinenfest is a real institution and always fun to play, but this year was particularly special for me. The old and new friends I met there, the lineup and the bass that turned my freshly opened beer stale during my intro…wonderful!</p>\n<p>Normally the event dictates what to play or I try to find the right balance in accordance to the line up and the slot I’m given. At Maschinenfest though, it’s normally all about making the most of the PA they provide - and it’s always intense. I’m normally set up for about one hour and I made a quick decision to start very ambient and slow then move over to pretty rough tracks over the course of two hours.</p>\n<p>I think I’ve been to Maschinenfest three or four times so far. You’ll always meet people there that you haven’t met in a while and it’s always really nice. Great talks, drinks, music - what else could you ask for!</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/155799703&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>SØS Gunver Ryberg has many talents. Working on an impressively broad spectrum of sound art - from installation and performance pieces to film &amp; video game music, she views the differences between her contrasting approaches in a surprisingly simple fashion. “I don’t necessarily distinguish between my various outputs” she begins when asked about her varied projects. “Working in connection with other media is just another way for me to express myself. People ask me to collaborate with them because they know my sound and music and connect to it” she explains. “I often get commissioned to make a piece for a specific site or setting. Then I’ll typically work with various multi-channel configurations. I enjoy integrating spatial elements whether it is an installation or a performance.”</p>\n<p>Whilst adhering to the guidelines set by commissioned work, Ryberg still manages to keep a firm grasp on her notably experimental signature - a sound which her home city of Copenhagen has been rather receptive to. “A lot has been happening in the last few years in the experimental music scene both in Copenhagen, and the rest of Denmark. There is a strong curiosity and openness towards experimental music whether it’s sound art, electronic, new classical music etc. It inspires me and make me feel free.”</p>\n<p>With a live performance at Atonal Festival imminent, Ryberg’s podcast for us gives us a taster of what can be expected; comprised of twenty-two minutes of abrasive, droning atmospheres and clamourous percussion. “I’m very excited to be part of the Atonal festival - I’m looking forward to experiencing the unique acoustic space, the whole vibe and ambience in that setting. I’ve worked on a mix that represents my expression, ranging from one earlier composition SIVA to a new one Cirro_Stratus which is recorded live in my studio. My set for Atonal is a continued dive into the transformative physical power of sound. It will be a mix between insistent rhythms and a meticulous exploration of textures and timbres.”</p>\n<p>No tracklist available.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/stray-landings-mix-series/id556425050?mt=2\">Subscribe in iTunes</a></strong></p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"60\" src=\"//www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?feed=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0031-s%25C3%25B8s-gunver-ryberg%2F&mini=1&embed_uuid=4003b17d-8600-4b98-ad1c-1a45c01d135d&replace=0&hide_cover=1&hide_artwork=1&embed_type=widget_standard&hide_tracklist=1\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/0031-s%C3%B8s-gunver-ryberg/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=resource_link\">0031 // SØS Gunver Ryberg</a> by <a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=profile_link\">Stray Landings</a> on <a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=homepage_link\"> Mixcloud</a></p>\n",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.gizehrecords.com/\">Gizeh Recordings</a>\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 08/09/14</p>\n<p>Hearing Loscil’s <em>Endless Falls</em> LP back in 2010 was something of an epiphanic discovery for me; the presence and tension he brought to the ambient genre felt refreshingly current. Since then my encounters with his productions have been somewhat infrequent, making the recent discovery of his collaborative ‘Fury And Hecla’ EP with Leeds based Paul Elam aka Fieldhead, all the more welcome.</p>\n<p>Delving into the realms of ambient &amp; electroacoustic music, opening track ‘Fury’ drip feeds the listener fragments of melancholic ambience. The result is as if the sound of a full string section were being slowly forced through a tightly-meshed filter. As the perspective gradually shifts however, vast open soundscapes are unveiled, in stark contrast to the insular melodic stutters the track begins with.</p>\n<p>Experimentations with space and scale is a defining factor of the release generally; Loscil &amp; Fieldhead’s droning atmospheres conjuring up vivid panoramic images of outdoor landscapes with ease. The track titles suggest this probably wasn’t a far cry from what they had in mind when writing the EP; ‘With Northerly Winds’ and ‘Northumberland’  sounding well suited their retrospective tags. ‘Hecla’ on the other hand manages both to call to mind the aforementioned wide open spaces, and somehow feel naggingly claustrophobic all at the same time. The close, abrasive buzz of an amplifier hums persistently, as lo-fi cello’s disintegrate around Fieldhead’s mournful orchestral loop.</p>\n<p>The real jewel is the crown however comes in the form of ‘Home’; Fieldhead’s rambling, docile melody offset with the crackle of vinyl and percussion so feather-light at times it almost slips out of focus entirely.</p>\n<p>With ‘Fury &amp; Hecla’ Manchester based label Gizeh has managed to bring together two acts defining the ambient genre on their own terms. Both afford it the dynamics and intensity it needs to stand alone as genre, outside its rather unfortunate association as mere ‘background music’. As far as I’m concerned, this alone is reason enough to add the DIY label to my ones to watch list for 2014.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/21853306&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"350\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Coming more than two decades since it’s last incarnation, Berlin Atonal was back for a second installment since it’s reemergence in 2013. Originally held in Kreuzberg’s acclaimed SO36, the festival was host to the likes of legendary innovators Einstürzende Neubauten, Test Department, 808 State, Psychic TV and many more. These artists are now something to the effect of household names in the city, but were at the time just seedlings of the bubbling underground scene that was about to go massive. In this respect, little has changed about Atonal; the festival continues to herald pioneering musicians and artists who will themselves become luminaries of the scene in turn. Furthermore, unlike most summer festivals, an achingly meticulous program bound Atonal’s style and aesthetic, such that nothing feels out of place, and not one artist from the impressive roster clashes with another. With the quality of artists set at such a dizzying height, it would be near impossible to give justice to each, instead here is but a few of my highlights…</p>\n<p>##20_08_14##</p>\n<p>The first thing that hits you about Atonal festival is the titanic mass of the venue. Despite having seen Kraftwerk before – it's located above the legendary Tresor club – the building is hard to get used to. Kraftwerk stands alone as a stunning monolith of metal and concrete that externalises the cold, hard music played within. The sheer awe factor that Kraftwerk gives upon entry is already enough to give it a special place in my heart; this is a festival that values the charm in the things that most find ugly, from the music to the all too oft-misunderstood Brutalist architecture. This is a festival without face paint, pie-eating contests or campfire songs. Instead, noise, chaos and darkness are given a special precedence by the festival and are encouraged to be explored in every respect.</p>\n<p>This can be said not only of the music but the long list of intriguing installations as well. What is made quite clear is that despite Tresor's notoriety as a space to dance in, Atonal situates itself closer to the art-exhibition ethos of music, meditating seriously on the nature of sound, not just moving to it. It wouldn’t be fair to refer to Atonal as simply a music festival either, as the visual dimension was given as much thought and consideration. A particular highlight, ‘PARSEC’ - a kinetic audio-visual installation within one of Kraftwerk’s mysterious side rooms - encapsulates the same psychological effect of much of the music played at the festival. Sixteen identical metallic arms oscillate around a central cylinder, creating a hypnotic and haunting vacuum of light and sound. I thought to myself how strange it was to have such a modern piece placed before a Steve Reich concert – what was the connection? – until it struck me; both Reich and this exhibition, and indeed much else that was on this week, work upon the principle that composite parts can create harmony, no matter how weird and seemingly chaotic they may be by themselves. A documentary on modular synthesis, ‘I Dream of Wires’ grounded this gestalt notion in its historical lineage from Moog to Throbbing Gristle to the modern DJ, exhibiting the myriad ways in which a analogue synthesizers managed to create musical unity from internal random fragments. Thomas Kircher, who introduced the film, later invited audience members to attend a free workshop at Schneidersladen, Berlin’s modular synthesis store, where guests were freely encouraged to indulge themselves in playing with these beautiful machines.</p>\n<p>The first piece of the music played at Kraftwerk was a befitting choice. Steve Reich’s ‘Drumming’ takes the rhythms and timbres of Ghana and recontextualises them within his minimalist project. The piece had an altogether more commanding effect when backed by the cacophonous natural reverb of the room, and this was intentional. Atonal itself recontextualised Reich as one of the fathers of inspiration for much of the repetitive electronica that dominates Germany today, tracing its ethnomusicology from the open spaces of Africa to the bustling streets of New York and finally coming together in this vast power station. However, the crowning piece of the evening was Reich’s ‘Music for 18 Musicians’ (potentially my favorite piece of music ever written.) It sounded different than my first listen as a random selection on someone’s Ipod in a Brighton chip shop, or on the 12-hour bus journey from Toronto to New York. Both hold a special significance to me, but both times I listened alone. By contrast, this was the first time I had heard the piece in a group, with everyone there held together by a shared passion for hypnotic repetition and structure in music, collectively reflecting on previous times <em>they</em> had heard it. For those who had never heard it before can now cite Atonal for their first time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4317/35676106560_3e7c6a14de_z.jpg\" alt=\"a\"></p>\n<p>##21_08_14##</p>\n<p>Speaking with Dscrd <a href=\"http://www.straylandings.co.uk/post/94836139358/dscrd-interview\">earlier this month</a> was more than enough to tantalize myself into giddy excitement over their performance on the first official day of the festival. Despite speaking with them personally, so much of their live set up was still a mystery: why was there five of them? What exactly were they doing on stage? The truth is, Dscrd function as a hive-mind – their answers to my questions were not delineated as one person over another, but as a single 5-letter unit: Dscrd. This mirrors the visual themes during their set – surveillance footage and security cameras presented the hive-mind mentality of consumerism, giving the audience the unsettling Foucaudian panoptical perspective that was the subject of Dscrd’s latest EP.</p>\n<p>Persisting the morbid manner of the evening, Miles Whittaker of Demdike Stare fame took the sound to somewhere altogether more psychedelic, showcasing his rich library of middle-Eastern samples and setting them against the backdrop of moody synthetic experiments. However, it was Sendai and The End of All Existence that exacted this science most concretely, slowly painting the concrete slabs of the room with waves of entrancing dub tones, each more dank than the last. What began to come clear throughout the evening is that the homogeneous sound of the festival was not tied down to what people expected to hear in a space like Tresor – I heard not one 4X4 kick for the first two days – rather, the festival was carving out a new space for itself that was wholly unfamiliar, and Berlin had not lost the spearheading, innovative climate that it was rightfully best known for.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4325/35932675701_ace5ea9748_z.jpg\" alt=\"qw\"></p>\n<p>##22_08_14##</p>\n<p>The third day of the festival found its direction shifting slightly away from its cerebral leanings, and instead honing in on the more visceral, physical side of music. Headless Horseman’s remorseless electro workouts overhead sounded all the more menacing on Kraftwerk’s mammoth sound system, while the seizure inducing visual display washed over the stunned audience. The atmosphere was one of immense anticipation, as the first after party at Tresor was round the corner.</p>\n<p>Free admission to Tresor on a Friday night is a significant luxury; although somewhat distinct in its approach to music from Atonal, the stunning concrete labyrinths that snake around beneath Kraftwerk make for a similarly intoxicating and psychologically intense experience. The notion of being ‘lost in music’ is rarely truer than in Tresor. With perhaps the exception of Berghain, there aren’t many clubs that are better suited for a festival after-party. A particular highlight included Pinch’s unexpectedly eclectic mix of percussive electro that sounded like oddball versions of some of the UK Bass music from the last two years, only darker and deeper. To close, Jonas Kopp brought the night to its knees with three hours of unceasing, no-nonsense techno tools that shook the walls out of their foundations until 10 in the morning. I left with little of my mind in tact.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4320/35676105470_0a54ab89af_z.jpg\" alt=\"v\"></p>\n<p>##23_08_14##</p>\n<p>Day four was host to arguably the most anticipated event of the festival: the first live performance from Cabaret Voltaire in over 20 years. Their new style was striking; gone were the overdriven post-punk pop jams of the 80s and in its place was super-modern hi definition noise, with nods to tribal techno and even jungle. Despite being from a conspicuously earlier time than most of the artists on the roster, CV delivered what was some of the most futuristic sounds of the entire festival, with an unmistakably modern sheen.</p>\n<p>Following on from the grainy, metallic sounds of CV came a performance from FIS in stark contrast to what came before. Now, the sonic palette had a distinctly naturalistic timbre, with ripples of tremolo lapping around the stereo field like a swirling cyclone of dead leaves. Neel – one half of Voices from the Lake - powered the night through with a set of achingly minimal techno-function tools in Tresor, often with nothing but a kick and mazes of tripped out modular synth lines and alarm sounds. Without a doubt the most impressive techno set of the week.</p>\n<p>##24_08_14##</p>\n<p>London-based Helm opened the ceremonies for the final day, providing a disquieting set of earthy drones and chilling textures. In contrast to much of the festival’s previous sounds, Helm used distinctly acoustic instrumentation – rocks, glass, Tibetan bowls – cranking the amplitude so loud it felt as if an eardrum-bursting clang was just round the corner: an affective method for instilling fear into an already unsettled audience. UF – a brand new collaboration between Samuel Kerridge and Berlin duo OAKE – didn’t give the audience much solace either, as momentum built towards the climax of the week. Although considerably more synthetic in tone than Helm, UF shook the room with equal weight, delivering pounding, off-kilter kicks, heavily textured noise and even cold-blooded screams at deafening volumes.</p>\n<p>This was, in a way, a final surge of the ‘Atonal sound’. What would come next would be two legends of their respective fields; Tim Hecker and Source Direct. Since 2013’s phenomenal _Virgins, _Hecker’s sound has centered on building endless layers of scattered and fragmented components. Hundreds of splintered pianos and organs sounded as if they were being slammed into one another in the venue by a poltergeist, creating an intoxicating hall of mirrors effect where different sides of the room echoed subtle variations of the same original resonances. These were supported underneath by thick static drones - almost too thick for the speakers - filling every nook of space in the venue. Indeed, Hecker’s set sounded better than anything else I had heard in the building, and seemed to turn the already ghostly space into something of a haunted house. The choice to place Hecker as the penultimate act on the final night was a perfect choice, as audience members were given space to reflect on their week before the final rave commenced...</p>\n<p>Legendary drum &amp; bass outfit Source Direct was an oddly appropriate choice to close the festival. Although I had heard almost nothing in this vein before at the festival, the rough, sonic assaults of early jungle felt right at home in Kraftwerk, and shook the bones of all those watching, giving the venue a lease of life not seen before all week. Despite Atonal’s antithetical approach to music making and art more broadly, I couldn’t help but smile when the house lights had been up for at least half an hour before Jim Baker was done delivering his set of jungle classics.</p>\n<p>Part of me finds it mildly embarrassing that Atonal fits, to such an alarm detail, the mold of how I would put on a festival. Is my taste really this predictable? But then another, less narcissistic part of me, accepts that Atonal is simply hitting the nail squarely on the head. Not just in the selection of music, but the visual arts, the venue, the name and everything that name represents.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>&quot;Valerio met Voiski while doing his art studies in Paris&quot; Ligovsko_ï_ begin when asked how they first came into contact with the owner of Parisian imprint Dement3d, for which they have recently provided the second release. ”He played him some of our very first pieces, and Voiski liked them straight away. He and the Silicate label that Voiski founded with some other musicians invited us to participate in the project “Outland”, a CD compilation based on the science fiction film of the same name. One of our pieces from this compilation has been published and we performed live during the release party. That’s how we have met Heartbeat, who was trying to build Dement3d at the time. Our collaboration with Dement3d started and we worked together on our EP - All four original tracks are very important to us; they evoke different images and emotions that we’ve come across over the last three years.”</p>\n<p>Whilst the first of their releases have only begun to materialise in the last few years, Nikolaï Azonov &amp; Valerio Selig's relationship in fact stretches back a good ten years - the pair first met in high school. “We spent a lot of time together talking and playing the music trying different styles” they explain of their introduction to electronic music. ”The discovery of ambient music was a real revelation for us, it seemed obvious to us that we wanted to follow this path. We really found ourselves in this music; there was some kind of alchemy.” Despite the pair's long standing friendship however, the collaboration process is not quite as straight forward as you might expect, with Brussels based Azonov living near 200 miles from Selig's residence in Paris. “We work from a distance. One starts a song and then sends it to the other to add some elements etc. When we feel we have enough material we meet in Nikolaï's studio for construction, arrangement and mix of the songs.”</p>\n<p>Recorded in Brussels, Ligovskoi’s mix for us covers a range of influences, including some of the formative listening material alongside their own productions ”Each of the tracks in its own way had a significant impact on us making us the Vibrate release showing future paths to follow and doors to open.”</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Stephan Mathieu // Auf Der Gasse [Die Schachtel]</li>\n<li>Tetsu Inoue // Elevator Drops [Unknown]</li>\n<li>Lawrence English // Droplet [12K]</li>\n<li>Tim Hecker // Borderlands [Kranky]</li>\n<li>Tu m’ // Monochrome#1 [LINE]</li>\n<li>Shuttle 358 // Ash [12K]</li>\n<li>Eliane Radigue &amp; Lama Kunga // Symbols for Yogic Experience [Lovely Music]</li>\n<li>Belong // Same Places (Slow Version) [Table Of The Elements]</li>\n<li>Pat Metheny &amp; Lyle Mays // Ozark [ECM Records]</li>\n<li>Radiohead // Treefinger [Parlophone]</li>\n<li>Celer // The Die That’s Caste [Conv]</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/stray-landings-mix-series/id556425050?mt=2\">Subscribe in iTunes</a></strong></p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"60\" src=\"//www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?feed=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0032-ligovsko%25C3%25AF%2F&amp;mini=1&amp;embed_uuid=a3402abb-6b16-43e9-b432-05c799fe03f1&amp;replace=0&amp;hide_cover=1&amp;hide_artwork=1&amp;embed_type=widget_standard&amp;hide_tracklist=1\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/0032-ligovsko%C3%AF/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=resource_link\">0032 // Ligovskoï</a> by <a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=profile_link\">Stray Landings</a> on <a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=homepage_link\"> Mixcloud</a></p>\n",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/innersurfacemusic\">Inner Surface Music</a>\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> 12”\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 26/05/14</p>\n<p>Quite when Tom Dicicco &amp; AnD’s ISM label are set to strike next I’m never quite sure; but it’s usually when you’re lest expecting it. The ‘Pitched’ EP from Brooklyn based drummer &amp; sound artist Angus Tarnawsky arrives equally out of the blue, melding the gritty off-beat productions of an act like Bandshell with hard-hitting, piston-like drums.</p>\n<p>Plastered with fuzz &amp; distortion, title track ‘Pitched’ opens the EP with clattering snares and static-laced kicks, their sparse placement adding a devastating impact. At first the transition into AnD’s remix of the opener is barely noticeable, beginning with the same cloying atmospheres and lo-fi hits. As the reinterpretation develops however, trembling dial tones and a grating synth-riff begin to note a change in direction, before a driving regimentation of Tarnawsky’s original drums cement the departure.</p>\n<p>Emerging snake-like from the wake left by AnD, Tarnawsky’s ‘Ad Nauseam’ follows. Gently abrasive snares wear into patiently evolving drones, scraping against them like sandpaper. Similarly stylised percussion runs through ‘Expand Contract’, sounding as if each hit had been resampled through radio speakers to the point of nearly disintegrating entirely. Despite this, the way Tarnawsky arranges his percussion gives them formidable weight despite their crumpled aesthetic.  The aforementioned ‘Expand Contract’ makes a good example of this; it’s rhythms jolt to and fro with dislocating force, whilst static surges like an electrified pool amongst the chaos.</p>\n<p>Finishing with a welcome break in pace, ‘Tour Maline’ heads up the release with gloomy synthetic tones driven by a buzzing pulse of low-end. As the first of their solo artist EPs since Tom Diciccio’s ‘Exit’ release back in 2012, ‘Pitched’ proves the label is more than capable of putting out work with a strong narrative. Through dismissing the need to be dancefloor functional, the release places ISM in a far more versatile position.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/152972345&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_artwork=true&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>It’s hard to know quite where Yves De Mey &amp; Peter Van Hoesen production’s as Sendai ought to sit; categorising them neatly into one or even a few brackets is invariably difficult. Their dark, warped take on electronic music has been bending minds (and confusing journalists) since they first debuted the project on Van Hoesen’s own Time to Express imprint back in 2009.</p>\n<p>Since then, far from rationalising or consolidating their sound, they have instead pushed the boundaries even further; their recent contribution to Stroboscopic Artefacts’ Monad series being as much in line with the Musique Concrete movement of the 1950s as the techno or drone signifiers they have attempted to be classed by in the past.</p>\n<p>With each artist’s history spanning back to the dawn of the noughties (and before if you count their previous aliases), we decided they would make fine candidates to contribute to our ‘That Time When’ series, discussing five of the most memorable gigs they have attended.</p>\n<p>##1 Flanders_1989##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3898/15109653302_6105bb2aae_z.jpg\" alt=\"Flanders\"></p>\n<p>Yves: I’ve seen quite a few remarkable concerts in my life, but the first one that really opened my ears was an Einstürzende Neubauten concert. I was 17 or 18 at that time, the setting was a small concert venue in a small town somewhere in Flanders. The concert was part of the “Haus der Lüge” tour. Sad coincidence, the concert was the same day as the day my German language teacher committed suicide. I was very fond of that man, and the EN gig all of a sudden became a cathartic experience. Regardless of the personal twist, it was a blast. The sound pressure, the attention to detail in what sounds like chaos, the screeching voice of Blixa Bargeld and the otherworldly percussion almost made my ears and eye pop out. Hearing sounds being born from scrap and junk, beats made from oil being set on fire on stage… I went home with a solid buzz in my ears, a melted brain and a heavy heart.</p>\n<p>##2 Unknown_2001##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5578/14923462617_ed1b9ecb25_z.jpg\" alt=\"Confield\"></p>\n<p>Yves: It’s a gig i already mentioned in an interview with Stray Landings: Autechre. It wasn’t the first time I heard them live, but this one struck me in particular. I think it was after the release of <em>Confield</em>: all their gigs before had strong similarities to their albums, i.e. I could recognize tracks.  But this one was different; you could say it sounded generative, but it was more than that. It didn’t have the random sensation you often get with generative music, it sounded much more controlled, and although not a same sound was heard twice, it felt like a firm body of work. The first thing that came to my mind if I had to compare the impact of the gig was the combination of a hardcore visit to the dentist and being cut-up by a bread slicer machine at your local supermarket. Of all the times I’ve heard Autechre live, this one left the most vivid memories.</p>\n<p>##3 Brussels_1991##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3858/15109652222_9f4022ba55_z.jpg\" alt=\"front242\"></p>\n<p>Peter: On top of my list is a concert by Front 242 at Ancienne Belgique in Brussels in 1991. If memory serves me right it was part of a series of two or three concerts, all of them sold out immediately. For me this was when the band was at its peak. I remember standing on the balcony, right above the PA where Daniel Bresanutti was leading the charge. I had never seen a band where one of the band members was not on stage but behind the mixing desk. As the band was performing in their home town the event had an intense ‘amongst us’ vibe, everyone felt really connected, something that was rare in Brussels back in those days. Musically I remember hearing a lot of tracks from the _Front by Front _album. As far as electronic music goes this is one of my most intense early moments.</p>\n<p>##4 Various_2005 - 2010##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5551/14923463267_6cb72e9e61_z.jpg\" alt=\"autechre\"></p>\n<p>Peter: Number two is an aggregate of several Autechre concerts which I attended between 2005 and 2010. I guess I saw them live three or four times in that period, but for me these performances are very much linked together. Each time it felt as if the audience was receiving a message from the future. But at the same time there was a playfulness involved, a will to bring some sort of relativity to what is otherwise a very serious endeavour. I guess that’s what makes Autechre to special. I really look forward to the next concert in October.</p>\n<p>##5 Eindhoven_2012##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3837/15107007651_07cec6cc29_z.jpg\" alt=\"eindhoven043mx3\"></p>\n<p>Peter: The last one is My Bloody Valentine in Eindhoven, a couple of years ago. Yves, his brother and I drove down there from Belgium, all three of us being MBV fans. During the whole concert we stood, or should I say, were pressed against the back wall. Our ear plugs were in full effect, but I still remember the incredible sound pressure level that was projected at us. I felt like being sandwiched between the sound system and the back wall. This was probably the loudest concert I ever attended. How the rest of the crowd closer to the speakers was able to endure this still is beyond me. But above all else, there was Bilinda Butcher’s ethereal voice floating amidst an ocean of blissful distortion.</p>\n",

Depicta had brought a heady - dare I say spiritual - element to the dancefloor, with angelic drones hovering overhead, rising the listener up above the club and into a celestial setting. This was a brave track, with a huge scope for imagination and expansive ambience that set itself firmly in my favorite 12”s of the year so far. However, <em>Suzi Ecto</em> is placed somewhere altogether more colourful and tropical, tracing a concise yet robust ethnomusicology from all over the world that is refreshingly distanced from his previous efforts.</p>\n<p>In particular, ‘Dovetail’, incorporates an ambling bassline with off-kilter rims and swathes of swelling pads. Lead single ‘Sulu Sekou’ holds a meandering clarinet over a down-tempo plodding low-end: both tracks something of a shock to the system for those expecting an album of TTTs (tedious techno tools). Furthermore, ‘Rain Dance’ – a personal highlight – playfully bounces woody hand drums around a network of analogue-electro bleeps: juxtaposing two seemingly antithetical sounds in an inventive and successful way. This interplay of naturalistic and artificial textures runs through the entire album, with percussive thuds of woodblocks, grainy fuzzes of sampled synthesizers and the soft pulse of steel pans darted all over**.**</p>\n<p>There are elements of the late Actress (R.I.P…) infused here too. There’s a sense in which Call Super is taking the baton from Cunningham and advancing the sound into something less alien and more familiar. The album ends with a tantilising pre-equal to latest release, briefly recalling the sample from Acephale to project his sound into the future; Call Super is far from done delivering albums, this is but the first chapter in a long narrative that he has only just begun to deliver.</p>\n<p>What is perhaps most striking about this LP is how clearly it has been thought out; this is far from a mere collection of techno 12”s – which, to be honest, was what I was expecting. To the contrary, Call Super is unafraid to dwell at a much slower tempo with a much broader conceptual reach. Not undancable, but not really dancefloor material either, <em>Suzi Ecto</em> holds itself up as a standalone work in itself, exploring and attending a wealth of vibrant worlds.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/165712919&color=0066cc&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>You may have run into the work of Japanese sound artist Yuji Kondo whether you know it or not. Whilst the Kansai based producer has had several releases under his birth name, his involvement in leftfield techno scenes runs far deeper, releasing under alias' such as Ducerey Ada Nexino and Steven Porter alongside Katsunori Sawa.</p>\n<p>The pair also orchestrate the staggeringly consistent '10 Label', an imprint which despite its short discography has managed to attract some of the most sought after names in electronic music, such as Matthew Herbert and Anne-James Chaton.</p>\n<p>With a four track EP of dense warehouse techno due out shortly on Ali Wells' stellar Perc Trax imprint, we decided it'd be a fitting time to catch up with Kondo to discuss the release, his relationship with Sawa and the Japanese music scene in general.</p>\n<p><strong>2014 seems to have been a busy year for yourself, releasing EPs under your birth name as well as the Ducerey Ada Nexino moniker. How would you describe the different between the material you produce as Ada Nexino and the Yuji Kondo releases?</strong></p>\n<p>I don’t really think of monikers during the initial sound materials making process. I usually decide which name to use when the demo track is complete. That decision is mainly depending on my intuition and the timing(s) around me.</p>\n<p>My new EP &quot;Radiate The Ocean From My Back&quot; has both new and old sound materials. It even includes the materials that were created before I started making Techno have actually featured sound materials that were recorded during my school days for a release “Kill Centre” (2012) on the Tokyo based cassette label, Sludge-Tapes.</p>\n<p><strong>You also work under the alias 'Steven Porter' alongside Katsunori Sawa, how did the two of you first meet, and where does the name for the project come from?</strong></p>\n<p>We already knew each other through the internet somehow. Both of us didn’t have any releases at that time. That was probably 2006 or 2007 when I met him at a cafe in Kyoto. That meeting actually became the starting point for the Steven Porter project.  We had an idea of having a person’s name like an ordinary one that often appears in a school textbook.  Also it was important that the name has an association with wings.  It’s somehow higher if that makes sense. I’m considering Steven Porter as a totally different project from our solo projects.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/22544153&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>The two of you also run '10 Label' together, how did this come about and what is it you look for in a release for the label?</strong></p>\n<p>We are doing treasure hunting basically and not aiming to release similar music every time. This approach might not be satisfying for conventional listeners; however we need to keep ourselves flesh all the time. Our opposite personalities are working well for operating the 10 Label. Meeting with Sawa, starting Steven Porter, founding the 10 Label, all of these happened spontaneously. I’m feeling that things we have been talking are gradually becoming a reality. I have a lot of gratitude for everyone involved in the 10 Label.</p>\n<p><strong>You've managed to feature some pretty amazing producer's on the label such as Matthew Herbert and Anne-James Chaton, despite having only put out three records so far – how did you get in touch with these artists originally?</strong></p>\n<p>They are really gentlemen that have taken our offer kindly. Although we just have met them once for a few minutes, we have been touched by their works for a long time.  It’s all magical.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/15245620232\" title=\"Yuji Kondo 2013 artist photo by straylandings, on Flickr\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/15245620232\" title=\"Yuji Kondo 2013 artist photo by straylandings, on Flickr\"><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3883/15245620232_8fe194be73_z.jpg\" alt=\"Yuji Kondo 2013 artist photo\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>Tell us a little bit about the new EP for Perc Trax. Ali Wells had released on '10 Label' prior to this I believe, was this your first contact with each other?</strong></p>\n<p>When I create an EP, I usually prepare session demos first and think of their titles according to their atmosphere / associated images; however as for the &quot;Radiate The Ocean From My Back&quot;, I took the opposite approach. It was my first time to use a personal pronoun for the title.  I didn't want the release to be something weird that often can be heard in the bottom of underground scenes. </p>\n<p>In my opinion, it has clear expressions / stories compared to my previous releases. I simply wanted this release to be really powerful that blows all the boring things in daily life away. I had my first contact with him after TEN001EP &quot;MU EP&quot; was released on the 10 Label. Fortunately he knew about us and thus we asked him to submit a track for the label’s second release “REPLAY”.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/116802176&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p>First time I met him was at a club in Osaka when he had a Perc show. His album &quot;Wicker &amp; Steel&quot; is brilliant. It's been our favourite Techno album. He is great.</p>\n<p><strong>How long had you been working on the tracks for prior to the release?</strong></p>\n<p>It took about five months in total but not that long for the actual track making.  It took me quite a time to think and decide what kind of sounds I’d like to bring to the Perc Trax. I’m deeply grateful to him. </p>\n<p><strong>Has electronic music always been your main focus? What kind of things were you listening to growing up?</strong></p>\n<p>I was listening to Rock music and playing a bass guitar in a band.  I even hated electronic music until the age of eighteen when I came across Warp Records’ catalogue. Then I dived into a world of electronic music. Now I like it.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you feel that Japan has a strong community in terms of noise and techno producers? I believe I am right in saying you're based in Kansai, are there many other electronic artists in the region?</strong></p>\n<p>I feel that Japanese people are not satisfied with domestic Techno or Noise scenes. I believe it’s not just only me. A critical thing has not yet happened in a Japanese club scene - I often feel that a gap between Japan and Europe is significant.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/70017720&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p>I do know great domestic producers, DJs, organisers, clubs and record stores. But I cannot feel a strong power or energy in the Japanese scene, especially in the last five years. There isn’t any decisive buzz. I’m not being too pessimistic here. We have to go through this situation somehow. People are all keen to witness the great tension of 90s. Although I’m not confident in myself I have a huge confidence in a music culture that has been growing from the past. </p>\n<p><strong>You're website credits you as a photographer for several of the Ada Nexino releases, and there has obviously been a lot of thought put into the artwork for the 10 Label releases – is visual art something you have a big interest in alongside music? </strong></p>\n<p>Yes, certainly. It is essential for me to imagine something in my head when I create music. This imagination is very important. As a producer I’d like to suggest things such as theme / concept / clue more or less. I’m using visual images to help this communication.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally what can we expect to hear next from yourself?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m currently involved in a project with an audio visual art collective in Tokyo. It's a medium I've never stepped into. It will be released at the end of 2014 or the beginning of 2015.  We will announce a TEN004EP on the 10 Label soon as well. It will be a great release. Thank you.</p>\n<p>_'Radiate The Ocean From My Back' is available from September 22nd. _</p>\n<p><em>Translation by Yu Miyashita.</em></p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/47642611&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> Bomb Shop\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 16/09/2014</p>\n<p>Filling time doesn’t appear to be a problem for Stockton based Michael Hann. Alongside running his own label, Reject &amp; Fade, he also finds to time to release under two different production alias’; Rejections and Marreck. Whilst the two projects have their own distinct sonic aims, closer inspection reveals further sub-categories. His recent ‘Mechanism’ release as Marreck on Tesla Tapes hosted a mixture of corrosive, noise-laden techno and spacious drone and ambient, perhaps in line with the work of labels like Stroboscopic Artefacts or Modal Analysis.</p>\n<p>His latest EP on the other hand, the Bomb Shop hosted ‘Thirteen Losses’ has noticeably different aims in mind. Shunning the niceties, the release sounds like the tattered remains of an old 90s rave tape; phasers and muffled laser samples cutting through a thick fog of distortion and static.</p>\n<p>'Beautiful K' provides an explosive opener, mangled synths and pounding 4/4 kicks hammering through the mist. Hann's approach holds no punches - the most aggressive traits of rave music thrust together in a twisted homage. Take 'Black Water' for example - kick drums pound violently beneath a swelling mass of screeching high-end, wildly oscillating through various delays and filters. Hann's use of filtering in general is one of the things which makes the release so captivating - there is a sense that these tracks could have been recorded in one take as subtle textural shifts and developments occur constantly.</p>\n<p>A constantly rising Shepard tone runs through the length of ‘Chateau X’ for instance, its dense, tension fraught sound palette leaving the listener little time to gather bearings. ‘False Martyr’ builds to a similarly frenzied climax, chugging low-end joined slowly by rasping, alien groans.</p>\n<p>Stream ‘Thirteen Losses’ in full via <a href=\"http://thequietus.com/articles/16293-marreck-thirteen-losses-ep-stream\">The Quietus</a>.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>“Have you heard of the fourth wall?” Reilly queries when asked about the choice of name for his co-run imprint Fifth Wall. His partner in operations Nico on the other hand poses a rather different question in justifying the title “It’s a shit obvious name - I actually hate it, but what you gonna do?”</p>\n<p>Those familiar with the mechanics of film and theatre will doubtless be familiar with the concept of the fourth wall - an imaginary wall that stands between the performance and its audience. “To break the fourth wall is to tear down that barrier, leaving the audience aware that they are witnessing a performance” Reilly explains further. “Some forms of art, like so-called ‘epic theatre’, break the fourth wall in order to heighten audience awareness of the wider political implications of the work, catalysing the audience to action. As for the ‘fifth wall’, I’ll leave it to others to interpret what that means.”</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/146266066&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p>Having first met in San Francisco at a Breast Cancer benefit club night, the pair began toying with the idea for the label, inspired by a lack of music in the area that interested the pair. They subsequently moved to Brooklyn where the shape of their oddball House &amp; Techno imprint began to take shape.</p>\n<p>When asked about the rapid growth in awareness of the label, Nico reflects; “It was obviously a nice surprise, I’ve seen so many better labels toil in complete obscurity for so long, it was incredible the way people just latched on to us. I think it was mostly a right place, right time scenario.” Whilst timing has doubtlessly played a role, the imprint deserves credit for retaining a persistently rugged, almost punk-like sound aesthetic without falling into the trap of releasing records which sound too similar to one another. The dialup techno of Metrist’s 2013 ‘Doorman in Formant’ for example is a distance from the sultry, crunching house of Matrixxman’s ‘XX Files’, yet you can still find crossovers between the two.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/15121078239\" title=\"NY by straylandings, on Flickr\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/15121078239\" title=\"NY by straylandings, on Flickr\"><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3881/15121078239_68a0fc078c_z.jpg\" alt=\"NY\"></a></p>\n<p>The diversity of the pair’s musical upbringing perhaps leads some clues as to the shaping of the label. Reilly thinks back to the sounds that have influenced him; “I grew up listening to (and playing) blues and jazz, as well as some classical music (I particularly like 20th century classical, like Bartok). I don’t know how much that influence shows in my music, but it definitely informs my approach to melody and harmony.”</p>\n<p>Nico’s background on the other hand comes from a possibly even more varied perspective. “My dad is a music producer who did everything from Tim Hardin to Lovin Spoonful to Chris Isaak. he was always putting me on to the shows he used to see back in the day like Nina Hagan, Einstürzende Neubaten’s first us show, O.M.D - shit like that. My mom was in punk bands as well and also was running Portishead constantly. To me Yo MTV raps and MTV in general had probably the biggest influence on me. From Kindergarden to third grade all I did was watch MTV and obsess over the Butthole Surfers, Dr. Dre, Bone Thugs, The Breeders and whatever else was playing between when I got home from school and when the maxx came on at ten.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/15120990219\" title=\"PT by straylandings, on Flickr\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/15120990219\" title=\"PT by straylandings, on Flickr\"><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5573/15120990219_3bee5db73a_z.jpg\" alt=\"PT\"></a></p>\n<p>Nico &amp; Reilly’s own production projects (Hound Scales and Divvorce respectively) also weave a plethora of different influences together, unsurprisingly providing a strong blueprint for what the label is about. “I’ve been playing instruments since I was a kid and had been experimenting with electronic music for a couple years prior to my Divvorce stuff” explains Reilly, whilst Nico offers an insight into the development of his productions as Hound Scales. “I had made mostly grime for the first year I was producing. Partly because it’s a lot easier to make broken beat compositions sound good when you don’t know what your doing. Making a beautiful dense techno track is something that takes a massive amount of discipline. As far as my own project, I concentrate mostly on sound quality. A song has to sound like an island as viewed from a passenger plane, with no extra debris floating in the water around it. Obviously I also had a strong rhythmic focus, its hard to stick to a solid 4/4 drum and hi-hat composition when I have so many different types of music trying to slither into my productions.”</p>\n<p>Nico’s interest in visual art also manifests strongly in the label’s output, having illustrated each individual record for the first release.** “**Like all things in my life I’m probably overly obsessed with contemporary art” he explains. A mixture of collaged images and illustrations make up his unique designs, often with a slight tongue in cheek sense of humour. “I’m inspired by artists that are conceptually minded and intense but also can take a joke; Martin Kippenberger, Rainer Fassbinder, Gary Simmons, Dieter Roth, Ken Price, people like that.”</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/76990934&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p>With so many different aspects of the label to concern themselves with, as well as the fact the pair are both either studying or working day jobs alongside the label’s operations, the consistency at which they have delivered fresh, idiosyncratic dance music has been quite exceptional. When quizzed on how he deals with the administrative tasks that come with running a label, Nico states “I do enough administrative shit during my actual job so I could really do without all the label busy work but that’s the price you pay to put out records you believe in. Of course, the rewards of the experience are more than worth it.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/15121176470\" title=\"5 by straylandings, on Flickr\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/15121176470\" title=\"5 by straylandings, on Flickr\"><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5585/15121176470_aa29f3affe_z.jpg\" alt=\"5\"></a></p>\n<p>The label’s roster has undoubtedly added to the imprint’s success, comprised of as many producers from Europe as from America; the areas of support for the label are also reflective of this. On the internationality of Fifth Wall, Nico reflects, “we definitely sell the most records in Germany/UK, but our fans seem pretty well dispersed. It’s been easy to bridge that gap as the NY sound has definitely gotten tougher in the last year or so. I think we still look for a lot of the same things, but maybe don’t require things to be as banging as when we started.”</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/106399360&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p>Reilly echoes similar sentiments; “living in New York and being around so many talented individuals has definitely influenced our direction. For one, we’ve had the opportunity to release music from some great American producers, like on our Giant Monarch 12”. As for support, I’ve noticed that changing as well—-when we started, the most support was in the UK and Germany, but our support is more global now. I think we have more fans in NYC than any other city now, which was not true at first.”</p>\n<p>The next release on the label is equally reflective of the bridge they seem to have built between European and American Techno. “The next one is from German production outfit Dualit with a remix from Brooklyn producer, Person of Interest” Reilly reveals. “We’re not quite ready to reveal the one after that, but I think people will really like it.”</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/153716063&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

Since the hedonistic excesses of the ’90s, Albertsson has operated under a different guise, his Finn Of Tomland project marking the start of a slower, deeper, more considered sound. Few DJs have the courage to include such a wide-range of different styles in their mixes; ranging from dank dub landscapes to hyper-frenzied noise. It is arguably this freeform approach that has led to Albertsson receiving wide acclaim for his sets, an achievement noted by Copenhagen venue Culture Box, with whom he now has a residency.</p>\n<p>Alongside his work as a DJ, Albertsson also runs the fantastic SonuoS imprint, exposing a range of leftfield producers to the scene at large, pushing an array of sounds as diverse as his DJ selections.

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/modal-analysis\">Modal Analysis</a>\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> 12”\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 01/10/2014</p>\n<p>As a co-owner of the label, Athenian producer ANFS was never going to struggle much in adhering to Modal Analysis’ sound palette. However, this shouldn’t detract from the fact his recent ‘Ground’ EP marks one of the most intriguing releases on the imprint so far. Spanning four tracks of quivering, lo-fi drones and ramshackle drums, the record inaugurates ANFS to the scene on his own terms which are to say the least, uncompromising.</p>\n<p>Haunting Eastern melodies and dirt-plastered samples dominate the release, earth-rumbling hits breaking the tension occasionally. The result is powerful and cinematic; the structuring of the EP itself lending strong narrative, as ANFS builds to an apocalyptic close with ‘Ground#4’. Cracking drums lurch forward and back drunkenly, like the steady sway of a ship being heaved through the water by its crew. The way the track drags itself forward feels tired and downcast, in stark contrast to its sharp-edged opening tracks. Bursting through the meditative drones built up in ‘Ground#1’, ‘Ground#2’ suddenly breaks into a frenzy of spartan rhythms, jumping into action with ringing tribal drums.</p>\n<p>Warbling synthesisers snake between ANFS’ gently pulsing bed of distortion across ‘Ground#3’, nauseatingly detuned vocals adding to the tracks already disorientating soundscapes.</p>\n<p>Where previous Modal Analysis releases have felt almost sketch-like, seeming to take a look at the similar ideas from varying perspectives, ANFS’ EP for the label feels cohesive and meticulously thought-out. Where prior releases have included remixes to flesh out the material, the ‘Ground’ EP stands up to scrutiny without need of this – a bold move, but an ultimately rewarding one.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/163966213&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

The project aims to explore the potential of the classic Roland instruments responsible for so much of dance music past and present: venerated analogue machinery such as the 303 and the 808. According to the press on the Kontra website, Roland never made a ‘404’ due to superstitious executives concerned about similarities between the number four and the Japanese word for death. The naming of the project may also be a nod to the internet 404-error message, where a website is ‘dead’, or the link to it broken. TM404 saw Tilliander carving out fantastically novel, textural electronic dub pieces - recorded in one-take live sessions with no overdubbing; they represent a coming together of techno’s futuristic preoccupations with the historical attention to detail of a passionate archivist.</p>\n<p>Svreca, owner of ubiquitous spanish label Semantica, is the perfect fit for a remix EP of TM404 – so perfect, in fact, he managed five unique interpretations. The points of connection between Tilliander and Svreca are many: glacial electronic dub with a focus on exploring the gritty textural possibilities of clinical analogue sounds – there is a palpable excitement in Svrecas’ wilful treatment of his sources. Across the EP structure is used as a skeleton on which to hang matter-of-fact polyrhythms &amp; subtle explorations of spatiality: see the way in which B2 rockets off with its propulsive rhythm, then barely changes for the length of the track. In a less skilled producers hand, this technique could become tiresome, but Svreca clearly grasps the mesmerising potential of loop based music – in a sense this is drone-techno, as functional in repetition as it is beguiling.</p>\n<p>The A-side of the EP clearly deals more with harmonic elements – A1’s subtle acid flutters outlining an enchanting but uneasy sonic space, while A2 feels like six minutes in purgatory’s sauna room - it’s repeated chord motif echoing out to infinity. In comparison the tracks on the B-side offset shifting polyrhythmic elements, with a single tonal centre, against monolithic kicks. This EP contains some of the purest-sounding modern techno: a heady distillation of crucial stylistic touchstones, it reaffirms Svreca as being among the best of those quietly brilliant producers; rarely properly appraised due to his prolific nature. If ‘404’ implies a broken link, then I hope it doesn’t signal the same for this match up: as a partnership it’s a fruitful one and long may it continue.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/163403737&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>DSNT is a multi-disciplined creative company based in Belfast. Given the multifarious domain that the collective work in, they are often somewhat difficult to define. Oisin, the groups spokesman sets the record straight. “It predominantly works on a per-project basis. I usually take a curatorial role on each project and put a team together. We have a Belfast crew that run the parties and help with the label which comprises of Nez, Ryan Dallas, G.Boo &amp; Sebastian.  We couldn’t have put on half of the guests we have done without them. They also help with the A&amp;R and a lot of the music we have signed has been influenced by them.”</p>\n<p>Despite the fact the group have a strong foothold in events, their operations include a wide manner of things. Previous engagements have included artist management, events management, record producing, graphic &amp; motion design, filming &amp; editing services, art exhibition curation, visual arts and motion graphics. They recently provided the visual show for Headless Horseman’s appearance at Atonal Festival for example. “It was an amazing experience, one of the highlights of my adult life” Oisin begins. “We worked on it for about four weeks straight, from 10am to 3-5am each night. At the start there was three people in the team working on the visuals and then in the last week we pulled in some extra guns in the form of Carlos Purcell who absolutely smashed it. It was a complete honour to be part of the event and we’re massively grateful at the trust the Horseman placed in our hands to produce something that I feel was really special. Berlin Atonal was the perfect festival, the production &amp; curation of the event was so tight.”</p>\n<p>Having been a huge supporter and follower of DSNT for some time now it seemed fitting to invite them to feature in our podcast series, ahead of their third birthday. &quot;In short, if you want to make money, do something else&quot; Oisin begins when asked about the landmark. &quot;Its been an amazing 3 years, great learning experience and an opportunity to meet some really amazing people, probably what I love more than anything is watching the community grow and develop over the past few years.&quot; Summing up the mix as ”Str8 up bangorz all the way”, Nez, the groups nominated DJ for the feature chooses to record in one take, offering a summation of the kind of set typical at DSNT events.</p>\n<p>With several parties upcoming to mark the birthday celebrations, the next few weeks seems to be heralding an extra push on all frontiers of the project, as Oisin explains. “After DSNT004 we have an all Irish EP featuring tracks from Sunil Sharpe, AnD, Eomac &amp; Fran Hartnett and to coincide with it we’re collaborating with Irish visual artist Danleo who does pretty sick illustrations.  We’re going to release a line of four t-shirts to coincide with the release (one for each artist) and we’re planning to develop a new visual show to coincide with the release and do a little mini-tour with our visual show &amp; artists. I’m also working on a bunch of other visual shows for various events, namely our upcoming show for Culture Night - Altered State.”</p>\n<p><em>DSNT will be joined by Karenn &amp; Sunil Sharpe to celebrate their third birthday on October 10th.

    "content": "<p>Rumah (aka Sean Hughes) can, with confidence, claim to be part of the Stray Landings extended family. Having first met through club nights in London, he has since contributed to our very first and most recent nights, compilations and radio shows. During this period Hughes has also been progressing independently onto higher and more established platforms, releasing and collaborating with the much-hyped Church label, and playing regularly at the legendary Corsica Studios.</p>\n<p>However, his latest EP alongside fellow Southamptonite Carl Jones aka Progression, finds itself in an altogether more suitable home, aligning their no-nonsense approach to UK techno with the no nonsense precision that Blueprint are so well known for. It’s always difficult to interview someone you know, because any time the atmosphere slides into the convention of a standard interview, it is quickly and strategically dissolved back into the familiarity that is usually shared between you. Instead, here’s just a short snippet of conversation that we had whilst listening to the new release.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/170291020&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p>Oh why are we listening to this? I don’t want to listen this.</p>\n<p>**Well I thought we should talk about the EP while listening to it. **</p>\n<p>Oh, no ‘cause there’s nothing to talk about, it just sounds like… techno.</p>\n<p>**Well why don’t we talk about the other person on the EP? Carl. **</p>\n<p>Carl’s really funny, he just likes making the music and at any point I say something like ‘’you could get some gigs off this you know’’ and try and get him to pursue it, he’s always like ‘nahh…’</p>\n<p><strong>What does he do when not making music?</strong></p>\n<p>He’s a dentist. Hang on no he’s not (laughs) it’s even stupider than that - he’s a manager of an opticians.</p>\n<p><strong>How does the writing work between you?</strong></p>\n<p>Well he’s just a better producer than me so how it _used to be _was that I did the sort of ‘creative’ side of things and he did the technical stuff. For ages he was really into the hyper-engineering ethos of dubstep and he was really focused on that Youngsta half-step sort of thing. But now I think he likes that this techno stuff is a bit more rough and ready, and as a result he’s actually got more interested in writing tunes generally.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/15413793546\" title=\"Sean by straylandings, on Flickr\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/15413793546\" title=\"Sean by straylandings, on Flickr\"><img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2947/15413793546_ebea3233cd_z.jpg\" alt=\"Sean\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>So did you get him into the 4X4 stuff?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah I think so. Because him and me made that EP with the horrible sexist artwork – the artwork was just a woman’s legs with a short skirt on and I said I didn’t want it but for some stupid fucking reason the manager of the label did it anyway. So after that I went back to Southampton for a weekend, about 2 years ago this was, and we worked on some stuff, some of which ended up on this EP. Anyway Carl used to run a night there in Southampton that I used to play at a bit like dubstep and funky stuff. The sound system that Carl got there was ridiculous – like 15k wattage or some shit but no one ever turned up because no-one likes that music (laughs). That’s where we kind of met anyway, I was always interested in what he was playing and I think he came to be more interested in what I was playing.</p>\n<p><strong>Where have you heard your EP played out?</strong></p>\n<p>My brother says he heard DVS1 or Ben Sims playing it when they were playing b2b at Awakenings. But then again he was fucked on pingers so who knows if any of that’s actually true.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you reckon you’ll stick with this ‘German-style’ techno for a while?</strong></p>\n<p>Well being with Blueprint is a dream come true, and James Ruskin is one of my favorite DJs. But in terms of the sound I think we want to move away from the tool-oriented kind of stuff, I want to do some more melodic bits. There was a time when we tried to go harder, and I remember when Blawan etc were kicking off, I don’t think I knew anyone who wasn’t trying to make tracks like that. And I remember making tracks with Metrist and people of that ilk and they’ve definitely gone more in that direction, making it more abstract and weird, which I think is cool, but not necessarily for me. If you ain’t got the funk then what have you got? I think this (Creech) is the best track on the EP. It must be like 3 years old now ‘cause I remember sending it to Church.</p>\n<p><strong>Are you still playing with Church?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, less regularly than I used to but it’s still going. They’re really good at just trying to push everyone on the label like I think Viers has got something lined up. Viers is sick, he’s like stupidly young and ridiculously talented – he does Unklone as well who do stuff on Fifth Wall. He can do dutty as fuck techno and house and pretty much anything. He even released a house edit of R Kelly’s ‘Feelin’ on your Booty’ which is like my dream so I kind of respect that (laughs).</p>\n<p><em>Since BPLTD005 is looking to sell out, a repress has already been ordered. </em></p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/53676460&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

Having produced under the alias for over a decade, Italian duo Lino Monaco and Nicola Buono have spent this period exploring the sonic capabilities of their assorted racks of hardware which are to put it mildly, extensive. As their most recent release ‘Ops-ci’ testifies, the creativity with which the pair work their equipment has seen them turn in releases which are consistently refreshing and unique in their approach.</p>\n<p>This particular EP treads a balance between clinical, Raster-Noton style synthesis and something at least somewhat more accessible. Although you might have to listen inbetween the staggered rhythms somewhat, there is a off-kilter funk and groove to many of these tracks, made all the more satisfying by its subtlety. Second track ‘delta.point’ makes a strong example: following on from the disconcerting soundscapes of opening track ‘collapse’, ‘delta.point’ darts to and fro, light-footed kicks dotting about between equally nimble surges of static, squeaking hi-end tastefully interspersed. ’[N]eon’ is similarly agile, as reverberant stabs and snaking melodies dart inbetween Retina.it’s squelching percussion. The effect calls to mind the charmingly idiosyncratic micro-house offerings of the late/great ~scape imprint.</p>\n<p>At other points in the release however the pair seem to take a completely contrasting approach. Listening to ‘gamma_minus’ feels icy and claustrophobic; like being submerged in dark waters, occasionally rising to gasp for air before being plunged into the blackness once again.</p>\n<p>'Ops-ci' serves as a reminder as to how painfully under-appreciated the Italian duo are; this EP being just one of many stunningly well-constructed electronic gems released from under the Retina.it banner over their many years of service. That said, those in the know can relish the release for what it is - a graceful addition to their ever expanding repertoire.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/157716294&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> West Norwood Cassette Library\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> 12”/Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 02/10/2014</p>\n<p>These days electronic music is rarely as wild in its experimentations as with Nick Edwards aka Ekoplekz’s recent ‘Rock la Bibliotek’ EP for West Norwood Cassette Library. Despite being caked in rave-era bravado (laser sounds and all), its untamed nature manages to call to mind the early productions of Kluster, with gritty sound design a prominent feature.</p>\n<p>As followers will know, Edwards is an avid hardware enthusiast. Given the creative freedom it affords him this makes sense as he gracefully crafts extended sonic trips with a finesse that is very hard to achieve with software equivalents. Take second track ‘Evakuate’ for example; static laced sirens announce their presence abruptly, echoing tape delay gurgling in the periphary. Often slightly off-beat, the imperfections from Edwards’ raw, unrestrained approach is where its greatest appeal lies.</p>\n<p>Wild meandering sonic experiments such as ‘Dropkone’ or ‘Perplekzed’ set the tone of the release perfectly; the listening experience is intense and disorientating, like wading through a murky swamp of alien wildlife.</p>\n<p>This said, the EP does have its moments of comparative clear-headedness (even if that is when contrasted with violent freakouts like ‘Sarkaztik’). ‘Metronomik’ for example is subtle and loop-driven,  a steady motorik pulse offset by driving synthlines and cavernous bass, in an offering of mesmerising simplicity.</p>\n<p>'Rock la Bibliotek' makes an interesting adaption of Edwards' sound to match the label, in sync with the oddball take on House and Techno that have comprised past releases. Where WNCL will venture next we can never be sure; the label's only predictable quality is their unpredictability.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/166599669&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Charting the the different influences behind the work of Stewart Walker can be an intensely confusing affair. Having released everywhere from m_nus to Mille Plateaux, his sonic interests migrate quickly as he experiments with different genres and production techniques constantly. The urge to experiment with different sounds was also instrumental in Walker's relocation to Berlin. Originally hailing from the Atlanta, Walker felt a strong draw towards Europe, inspired in part by American writers who made the same pilgrimage, such as Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, and Henry Miller.</p>\n<p>With the recent release of his sixth full-length LP, <em>Ivory Tower Broadcast</em>, we decided to catch up with Walker to discuss the album, working for Native Instruments and how dining arrangements in Berlin have changed over the years.</p>\n<p><strong>So first off how are things? You recently put out <em>Ivory Tower Broadcast</em>, your sixth LP. How has the response been so far?</strong></p>\n<p>It's only been a week since it came out, so it feels too early to really gauge the feedback. Reviews so far have been really positive, and I've been really pleased that many of the reviewers seem to have researched my interviews to contextualise the music within my own frames of reference. </p>\n<p><strong>Prior to <em>Ivory Tower Broadcast</em>, your last release was a number of years ago, what have you been working on in the interim? Was it a struggle to come back to the project and do you feel like this most recent album marks a change in direction?</strong></p>\n<p>It's not entirely true that I've been lying fallow over the last 6 years. Since &quot;Concentricity&quot; was released, I released the &quot;Scratched Notes&quot; EP on Curle in 2010, and four digital EPs on my Son of Cataclysm label in 2011. But after working so hard on the concept and music of SoC, it became really clear to me that digital EPs don't even make a ripple. No matter how much time I spent on a compelling concept, and making kick-ass music, &quot;the medium is the message&quot; still holds true today. If I really wanted critical consideration and a platform for my ideas, I needed to do an album. </p>\n<p>Incidentally, as I have said in a few other interviews, <em>Ivory Tower Broadcast</em> is the third complete album I've written during this period of time. With ex-Persona label-mate Touane, we wrote an amazing afrobeat and fusion-jazz tinged album called &quot;<em>Golden Parachutes … Into the Dark Grey Morning</em>&quot; which has been picked up and dropped by two labels at this point. The second label even went so far as to press vinyl but they never got it together to actually release the project. The second album was a band-project called Solis which I wrote with Samuel Rouanet and a local Irish singer but the other two participants were too busy with their own projects to really commit to signing, promoting and touring an album. So I finished it just for my own pleasure.</p>\n<p>The overriding point here is that writing music comes relatively easily, but selling music requires a dedicated team, and many of the people I work with are spread so thin with their own dream projects that it can be difficult to pursue my goal to completion. As a result of that, I am resisting any future collaborative urges and trying to stay focused on my own music and career.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/14227762&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>The press release for the LP references post-punk, techno, DJ Screw and Appalachian mountain music... did you make a conscious effort to include such a diverse array of influences or did they come through more naturally?</strong></p>\n<p>Over the past couple of months I've read a few different press releases from producers who got so inspired by one event that they wrote an entire album in a week. I'm jealous of that because I usually can't even complete a song in a week. Completing a song is an iterative process, and I often spend more time listening to a sketch than recording a bunch of new elements. Also, there are always new production techniques I want to learn and explore. So, the whole course of writing an album usually takes me six months of recording and then another six months of fine-tuning. Naturally, influences and inspiration rise and fall over such a long period of time. </p>\n<p>On <em>Ivory Tower Broadcast</em>, the original idea was to make a homage to DJ Screw, but indirectly - I didn't want to appropriate his sound. There's already too much ugly history of white musicians appropriating African-American tropes, and I have my own history and terroir. Similarly, I have no direct connection with post-punk or any of the other genres listed above, aside from having been a fan of these styles. Instead I'm obsessed with finding my own authenticity and amplifying it. Like many, I became a techno producer following the Chicago/Detroit/Berlin templates but after my tenth year of making techno (e.g. 2006), I realized that my own artistic relation to these genres was completely tangential. Europeans always ask me if I'm from Detroit, and then they seem completely mystified when I say Atlanta. Like what did Atlanta, GA have to do with techno, and what was I doing recording ambient music inspired by Fax and Apollo and Rather Interesting in Athens, GA, in 1994? </p>\n<p>At some point, I realised that there's no difference between taking inspiration from Pete Namlook (RIP) while living in Georgia, and taking inspiration from John Fahey or early Cure albums while living in Berlin. I am the common thread, and I can shape influences from anywhere and any time into my own sound. This is why I was overjoyed when a recent review of <em>Ivory Tower Broadcast</em> called my music Post-Everything.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/15344674657\" title=\"SW2 by straylandings, on Flickr\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/15344674657\" title=\"SW2 by straylandings, on Flickr\"><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3950/15344674657_658829e596_z.jpg\" alt=\"SW2\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>You've released on a pretty diverse array of labels in the past from techno labels such as m_nus, Curle or Tresor to more experimental outlets such as Mille Plateaux. What is it you are looking to achieve when you're composing and what do you think the link is between these different approaches?</strong></p>\n<p>It's important to remember that all of these releases have been spread out over seventeen years and six different cities, in pre-computer analog synth and drum machine-based studios, or laptop-based bedroom studios, and now a more fully featured recording studio with drums, guitars, synths, amplifiers, and a growing microphone cabinet. It would be more strange if my music sounded exactly the same over that period of time.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, I just don't want to make the same song twice and I'm not trying to hone a formula. Every time I press record, I am starting with no preconception beyond &quot;let's experiment and have fun with sound.&quot; As you can imagine, sometimes I spend six hours banging my head against the wall and end up with garbage. Or sometimes underneath all the garbage is one beautiful sequence or chord progression that I listen to for years until I find the right matching component.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned before, I am always reading up on music technology whether it's a new plug-in or a Mid-Side drum recording technique and I feel compelled to try it to see what kind of sound comes out. I have a pretty clear idea of what my own palette is and what I like vs what I don't like. A lot of this experimentation ends up wasting time, but making music is as much about the journey as it is the final product. These days, I think I'm getting good at mashing up a bunch of these techniques into a rich and complex result which still sounds natural.</p>\n<p><strong>You have spent a significant time working for Native Instruments, in what capacity? Do you think working there has had a big impact on your production?</strong></p>\n<p>I've been freelancing for NI for about three years in the Product Design department of Traktor. Part of my job is as a mastering engineer for the Traktor Remix Sets sold online by record labels and the other part of my job is that I get to research and evaluate new types of DSP algorithms and decide if they could be useful in the future. Otherwise, I am frequently the dissenting voice in group decisions about new software or hardware features, presenting my opinions as a live performer rather than a DJ.</p>\n<p>As a researcher, I love being one of the first to play with new proprietary sound algorithms, and as a mastering engineer I have the amazing benefit that I receive all the stems of the songs which I then process into Remix Sets. In that regard, I often feel like Neo in the end of the Matrix when he sees all of the information hidden in his environment. I get to see learn how a wide variety of producers create their tracks, whether they're simply eight tracks bounced from Ableton or forty eight bounced from Pro Tools. But since techno production has become my day job, I feel much more free to explore different musical concepts in my own creative time whether that's recording instruments or working at different tempos and time-signatures.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/145688099&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Was this the reason for your move to Berlin? How long have you been there for now, and how do you feel the city has changed a great deal over the years?</strong></p>\n<p>I moved to Berlin in 2003, so I've been here just about eleven years. I came primarily for musical reasons and that I could actually earn a living making records and playing shows. When I left the US, it felt like the local scenes didn't really respect local producers and there was also a strong political repression working to essentially criminalise electronic music events. But I'd honestly been dreaming about living in Europe ever since I read stories of the &quot;lost generation:&quot; Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, and Henry Miller living in Paris in the 1930s, writing books, and living a bohemian life. And in my teens, I got all of my music news from imported issues of NME and Melody Maker, that I had to pickup at a downtown bookstore. </p>\n<p>Berlin has changed a huge amount since my arrival. I would even venture that Berlin has changed more radically than any other European city over the last ten year. Today, it's hard to remember how absolutely desolate it was, and I often regret not taking more photos. Maybe back then you had a handful of nice restaurants on Alte Schönhauserstr, but now you can't throw a rock without hitting a fancy café or clothing shop. I can't really complain about gentrification though since I was part of the first wave of artists. I actually like having more good restaurants to go to and don't miss the era when the main dining options were döner or falafel.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us a little bit about your experiences running labels Persona and Son of Cataclysm. What was the original motivation for setting up Son of Cataclysm for example? I believe the imprint's Soundcloud bio goes into some detail on the subject... </strong></p>\n<p>In my experience, running a record label is best compared to a self-destructive addiction. It felt really good at the time but in retrospect it's clear that it was ruining my life. Most tangibly because I lost my life's savings when I was trying to maintain Persona's monthly release cycle. Spending tens of thousands of Euros per year on mechanical royalties, studio space, record manufacturing, and publicity, it was really easy for me to lose sight of reality. Record sales were going down at an alarming pace, yet my distributors were calling me to say &quot;we've sold out and have an order for 10, please press 300 more!&quot; And this was in the week before they announced their bankruptcy. And when that bankruptcy occurred, I lost not only the money for the previously sold records, but I also lost access to the upcoming records sitting in their warehouse as they were now &quot;assets&quot; of the court. Six months afterwards I finally got back a palette of 2000 records, but you can't sell old stock when the vinyl sales cycle is only about what's new this week. So, my cellar is still full of unsold stock reminding me of how mad I am when I start to fantasise about running a label again. </p>\n<p>In retrospect, I'm a better musician than label manager. Some artists manage to write music, play gigs every weekend, and run a record label all at the same time, and I respect the hell out of them. I just can't do it myself. </p>\n<p><strong>Finally what's next for yourself? Are there many live dates booked to coincide with the album's release? </strong></p>\n<p>At the moment, I've just performed four shows for the album tour including my Boiler Room performance, and don't have anything scheduled after that which is kind of fine by me. I am in an R&amp;D phase for my live show because just playing loops from Ableton Live isn't really doing it for me anymore. Too many people think I'm DJ'ing, and I can't deny that's what it looks like. No matter how many months of preparation go into writing material and processing it into loops, this preparation doesn't come across when I play. And though the sets I've played have been pretty flawless executions of my sound, I don't think they've been much to look at. So, I've tried adding the live koto playing, and my recent release party added a live drummer and a VJ to the mix to improve the visual interest. </p>\n<p>That's the direction in which I want to continue working. The days of me playing the club circuit every weekend with Ableton and a controller probably aren't going to happen again. I tried to bring as much creativity to the format as possible, but aside from a few notable exceptions, the audiences who came to these shows wanted less creativity and more boom boom. Techno was always a combination of the artistic and the physical for me and for a long time I thought the two could co-exist in nightclubs, but if I want to present a more artistic music these days, I think festivals, theatres and concert halls are probably better venues.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/166912798&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>The word Acharné comes from the French word for ‘fierce’, ‘obstinate’ or ‘intense’. Speaking with the anonymous artist who has adopted the word as his moniker, it becomes clear rather quickly the tag fits; interviewing Acharné sees more questions asked than answered. ”If ‘Berlin techno’ is reduced to white-noise washes and 40Hkz drones, where does that leave the story of the GDR? If hip-hop producers en mass are emulating Timbaland’s sampling of tabla-loops, where does that place the roll of Sufi music in our collective imagination? If half the top-selling ‘house’ tracks on beatport are marked by an ‘afro-Americanised’ male voice talking about ‘back in the day’ and ‘real Detroit techno’, where does that place the Detroit of today in our imaginations? What does that say about our relationship to gender, authority and the Black Male body?”</p>\n<p>Although currently based in Berlin, Acharné travels extensively, and he explains his views on the idea of a ‘home city’ with a degree of scepticism. ”I’ve always felt ‘disconnected from any ‘dirt space’ in a fundamental way. This isn’t necessarily something I view as ‘negative’, but rather an inevitable part of a de-centralised work environment, and something I find really valuable to explore and embrace. Ultimately, its the human condition we all share - the challenge of forming identity and purpose beyond boundaries, which I guess are all ultimately just imagined.”</p>\n<p>Sonically, Acharné is equally unwilling to settle, flitting between ambient, sound design, and techno with ease, as evident from his latest release on Seppku. Explaining how the EP came about, it becomes evident the chosen home for his productions was decided on with care. “I’ve been friends with the label-manager, Dan for some time. For both of us, I think, Seppuku is a tenuous ‘mark in the cultural sand’. Experiments – or rather ‘survival strategies’ for navigating through life in Berlin, through clubland, through the rise of EDM and the “meme-ification” of social media, short-form attention-deficit journalism. Both of us work in music and media, and these projects are counter-balances to the strange acid-seas we sometimes swim within – stuff I’d call “Big Pharma Techno”. So much once so-called “underground” music has been subsumed by high-commerce – which is totally fine, in once sense… but also polarising and utterly creatively stymieing for many producers who insist on identifying as ‘old school’ or ‘originators’ or whatever.  My EP “Rooms Without Walls”was something of an allusion to this tension between transicence and settlment, which continues to fascinate me. Many of us here in Berlin are here are transient workers, migrant workers, sound and light and text workers – here for a certain time.  Berlin is traditionally the model city of temporality, becoming, yet never ‘arriving’.”</p>\n<p>Coming hot on the heels of his Seppku release, Acharné’s contribution to our podcast series comes in the form of a recording of one of his live sets. When pressed further on the origin of the performance, Acharné reflects on the circumstances of the recording. “The live-set was recorded in an bunker space in Berlin, which I’m only going to refer to as “Quarantine”, as I was incredibly ill and feverish during the recording. Much of the base-material was actually generated in the preceding 48 hours – again, largely due to a sort of delerium I find myself in when I get ill – which seems to be more frequently in recent years. In situations of panic, melancholy, illness, I revert to a kind of primal insomniac mode – and tend to completely isolate myself. Hence, the genesis of this recording.”</p>\n<p>No tracklist available.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"60\" src=\"//www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?feed=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0035-acharn%25C3%25A9%2F&amp;mini=1&amp;embed_uuid=43a4abde-a533-4cc7-bff5-63f1a17ebe7f&amp;replace=0&amp;hide_cover=1&amp;hide_artwork=1&amp;embed_type=widget_standard&amp;hide_tracklist=1\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/stray-landings-mix-series/id556425050?mt=2\">Subscribe in iTunes</a></strong></p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Over their now decade long existence, London based Combat Recordings have always managed to keep their output staggeringly consistent. Founded in 2004 by Singaporean DJ &amp; producer Stormfield, Combat focuses on dark industrial soundscapes and brutally twisted noise, amalgamating dubstep, techno, breakbeat and anything else which can be twisted into line with the Combat school of thought. </p>\n<p>The imprint's roster is testament to this, and with the release of their latest compilation celebrating their ten year anniversary, we decided to invite the album's contributors to quiz Stormfield on the history of the label, audiovisual shows and how ego effects creativity. </p>\n<p>_Mick Harris __<strong> First bass experience?</strong></p>\n<p>University of Dub in Brixton.

Funny that, at the end of Uni, my mum wanted me to return as it was a more “stable” environment back East, but now things there have gone all tits-up, debt-culture the same as over here. But here at least there’s enough music stuff going on to keep me interested.

Any longer and it starts looking like a hedgehog. I call the style &quot;miscommunication&quot; because no matter what I say to the kurdish barber, I always walk out of there with something of a mohawk.</p>\n<p>_The Wee DJs <em> </em><strong>What's the best, and worst electronic live act you've ever seen? Don't hold back.</strong></p>\n<p>Best heard, Cane (Funckarma) live at Arcola Theatre. Ninety minutes of broken, sub heavy, deep electronics. Best seen/heard - Chris Cunningham AV set, full on brutal assault on the eyes and ears. Totally blown away. I dont know how &quot;live&quot; it actually is though, there's so much going on and it's so precise, impossible for one pair of hands to do it all in realtime.</p>\n<p>The worst? That's an easy one because a lot of cheesy stadium-level &quot;electronic&quot; acts could fit that description. Or in smaller venues, seeing an electro legend turn up in Miami with a full expensive hardware setup on stage then proceed to sing some awful karaoke cheese...</p>\n<p>_Milanese __ <strong>What do you think of music today compared to ten years ago, and where do you think it'll be in another 10 years?</strong></p>\n<p>Electronic music from the 90s has a special place in my heart because those were my formative years, I still listen back to stuff of that time for inspiration. But that’s youth/age. Any kid who pops their first E listening to tracks of now, would probably feel the same innocent / fresh excitement and get motivated to do stuff. At least I’d fucking hope so.</p>\n<p>Music of today - the first thing I’d say is there is an awful lot more of it about, whereas in the past you had to investigate and seek out the gems, now it’s more a case of having to aggressively filter out shite to keep focus on the good tunes. The situation now is not better or worse, you just need a different way of approaching it.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/169221868&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p>This abundance is simply a natural result of the availability of production software and more powerful computers, allowing anyone to make tunes. There’s some decent sounding cheap new hardware around too. Production and sound design standards have gone way up compared to before. Saying that, it’s easier to sound clever and complicated with sound design plugins but the magic disappears once you discover what makes that mad sound, or that it’s just presets. So I’m wary of stuff that’s actually bollocks but trying to hide behind “sounding clever”. I was walking around the Thames waterfront  with Autechre &quot;Amber&quot; in the headphones just now - hearing it over a decade later and with producer ears - you start to pick apart the tricks/techniques used but underneath all that is first and foremost genuinely awesome music. So I try to apply that process when hearing other stuff.</p>\n<p>The next ten years, who knows, but it will absolutely be informed by the advance of technology.  There’s now apps in your phone that you can make music with, really good ones, and there’s arguably more people owning PCs and smartphones than keyboards/turntables. There’s even synths which generate sounds based on visuals or other input. Creating stuff by totally crossing the eye/ear sensory divide. Game consoles will play a bigger part too, they are ubiquitous now and not going away anytime soon. Sounds and ideas from these will feed indirectly and directly into the tunes.</p>\n<p>Of course there’s a lot of bollocks gimmickry about, but I’m genuinely interested in interfaces that allow new ways of direct, meaningful musical expression. One of the Combat projects for 2015 is a collaboration with sound artist Marco Donnarumma, he’s created an instrument that literally samples body muscle frequencies. Tiny mics pick up muscle vibrations of around 5Hz which get pitched-shifted up to human-audible range, the sound is then effected via body gestures e.g. moving the arm around in specific ways with muscles tensed. It generates some interesting sounds, and all spontaneous, personal and immediate!  As long as there’s genuine ideas and music in the track, I don’t care what weird new tech people use to make it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/15616189326\" title=\"storm subsekt foto 1 by straylandings, on Flickr\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/15616189326\" title=\"storm subsekt foto 1 by straylandings, on Flickr\"><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3951/15616189326_1d0f301227_o.png\" alt=\"storm subsekt foto 1\"></a></p>\n<p>Audiovisuals are a growing thing too - again the result of more powerful computers. So it’s possible to produce music and visuals together, one informing the other and vice versa, all on the same machine. So there be much more music that takes shape in that way.</p>\n<p>On a collaboration level, things will be much easier in future. You can work on tracks with someone living on the other side of the planet, the project is online for both people to tweak. There’s already websites that sync up DAWs.</p>\n<p>_ScanOne __ <strong>Tell us about your visual projects. What are you inspired by, and how do you see the visual side of Combat progressing in future?</strong></p>\n<p>There's a few things going on. I've also done visual jams for some friends like Broken Note, Scorn, Anodyne, Roly Porter. Solo, there's the Stormfield A/V stuff for gigs, more on an electro/tech angle sonically/visually. Of course there's also the infamous Fausten which is an A/V collaboration with Monster X &amp; Emoresh, which goes fairly dark involving sexual torture, blood and other cheerful stuff. In a way, Fausten is the main driving force for visual creativity for me, because we film, direct, animate, edit, audiosynch and try out new ideas, techniques and equipment for example live infra-red and CCTV footage feeds. There's one video out (<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/64065692\">Punishment</a>) and two more which get premiered this November at the Ten Years of Combat party.</p>\n<p>Inspiration, all of it! But especially the unusual, the dark and the intense. In the future, Combat will keep on doing more visual work that's grounded in solid music, which is the label's roots.</p>\n<p>_Ontal __ <strong>What's the story behind the combat logo?</strong></p>\n<p>The devil mask? It’s a “Hanya”, Japanese demon. There’s an old film Oni Baba, a Samurai wearing the mask gets killed by a jealous woman, who takes the mask for herself, wearing it to scare off people. But the mask is cursed, later she discovers she cannot remove it. With a lot of force it comes off but she’s horribly disfigured. The mask is a cursed kind of power - very cheerful happy stuff!</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/169222331&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p>_Ontal <em> </em><strong>Have you considered contacting Source Direct for a release on Combat?</strong></p>\n<p>Many times, of course. Especially now he (Jim Baker) has resurfaced. But at the moment the label is low on funds, and to release vinyl costs money - I hate going up to people with big plans and grand ideas unless I already see a way to achieve them. It’s just talk otherwise. I actually met Jim and Phil and had a brief chat during a rave in 1998, although I doubt Jim would remember it. SD has always been my heroes so it would be amazing to get SD involved at some point. Icing on the cake.</p>\n<p>_Ontal <em> </em><strong>What Schnapps would be the official Combat drink?</strong></p>\n<p>52% Sliwowica! The warrior juice. Down a shot, run out into the snow and fight bears - it’s that kind of drink. Surprisingly no hangover the next day. Pure.</p>\n<p>_Dead Fader __ <strong>How deeply do you feel ones music is an extension of ones personality.</strong></p>\n<p>As a listener, yes of course if a tune connects to you enough then it becomes part of your psyche. It’s impossible not to be influenced by something especially if you like it and willingly expose yourself to it often.</p>\n<p>Producer-wise, it depends person to person. I hope it’s not always an extension of someone’s personality – how many times have you heard a track you like, met the producer in person and discover they are actually a cunt? It spoils the tunes a bit, at least in my mind. I’ve been lucky so far, but you do hear of that stuff happening.</p>\n<p>_Dead Fader __ <strong>Do you feel a particular pressure to be 'macho' in the particular scene u work in.</strong></p>\n<p>But what scene is that? Combat crosses over several genres. We do hard music but also equally do the introspective, deeper side. One thing I have noticed is people that make the harder aggressive music tend to be quite chilled in person. It’s more of a way to vent. So the “macho” that you perceive is more of an outburst that happens to repel people, but it also creates void in which those that really enjoy/understand it can relax. Takes a while to get the head around this, but then you can get into it properly and “hard” music gigs become a lot more fun.</p>\n<p>Ever notice how the steroid heads in the gyms tend to listen to really awful cheesey music? Or those extreme sports shows/videos. Fucking horrible tunes, why the fuck? That to me is macho music.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/169221180&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p>_Dead Fader __ <strong>How do you think a person's ego affects the quality of their output?</strong></p>\n<p>Creatively it does, negatively. Creativity is fluid and changing. The ego needs a solid/consistent surface to attach itself to. This is not possible if the music is constantly shifting, changing or evolving. So logically, ego drives a producer to be more conservative in their work, strict guidelines, a certain amount of predictability based on what worked well in the past- it’s calculated to make a stronger favourable impression, gets more positive attention which is what the ego wants.</p>\n<p>From running a label point of view though, the ego is a useful thing because having a consistent identity IS a strong advantage for any label. Unlike production which is a creative, fluid process, curating a label’s output is conversely a rigid, reductive process because you sift through a load of stuff, actively reject a lot of it to put out only stuff that fits a certain view. The options are being limited by intent, so to speak. Ego needs to take shape via events over time, and again this is exactly what the label does with output, it imprints it’s identity over a series of releases.</p>\n<p>Nonima _ <strong>What is your motivation in keeping the label moving forward now that Combat has 10 years under its belt?&quot;</strong></p>\n<p>Creatively, there’s interesting tunes being made, which others aren’t releasing, for whatever reasons. To be honest there’s a load of stuff waiting to come out, whenever budget allows. At least a few albums and a load of EPs. It’ll come.</p>\n<p>I’m quite keen on the audiovisual aspect of things, which is evolving along with the label.</p>\n<p>_Cursor Miner <em> </em><strong>What is the electronic music scene like in Singapore? </strong></p>\n<p>Don’t really know tbh, not been back for a long time. But there’s a few people doing interesting music and nights, I keep seeing mentions of “Syndicate” which is a collective pushing sounds outside of the usual club stuff. There’s also a producer whom i’ve kept in touch with a guy called <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/outlierrecordings/sets/out_26-rora-realis-soulo/\">Rora Realis</a> who makes pretty good off-kilter beats.</p>\n<p>There’s also a really techno guy called Xhin, but in terms of gigs he plays a lot more over this part of the world.</p>\n<p><em>For more details on on the compilation you can visit <a href=\"http://www.combatrecordings.com/\">www.combatrecordings.com</a>.

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> <a href=\"http://3bsrecords.bandcamp.com/\">3BS Records</a>\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> 12”/Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 15/08/2014</p>\n<p>Twenty years ago, I may have been forgiven for having as little knowledge as I do of music from the other side of the world. Now however, I have no excuse. With the frenzied cross-cultural chatter of the Internet, transcontinental communication has become so commonplace that it sometimes feels as if where you live is relative only to the speed of your WiFi. From my own perspective, the main source of transmissions emanating from Australia lately has been from Sydney-based label 3BS. For the last three years, 3BS have been pushing experimental techno, house, and all manner of unclassifiable music from down under, with a keen ear for rich, synthetic soundscapes and moody down-tempo jams. The label’s founder, Jonathan Papert is a proprietor of this sound in his own right, and his eponymous debut LP sets forth the manifesto for the label, placing earthy timbres within unearthly settings.</p>\n<p>‘Liberation’ opens the album with a vacuum of swelling strings, <em>liberating</em> the listener up into a heavenly expanse. The beat underneath punctuates saintly ambience with every pulse, rooting the sound firmly in the ground with the soft thud of an elephant’s march. Eventually, the magnetic pulse of the groove gives way to a wall of otherworldly hums, creating a twirling wormhole of organs and strings – a marked highlight of the whole LP. By contrast, ‘Hora Lunga’ submerges the sound back under the surface, with one colossal wave of warm pads, like a submarine resignedly sinking to the ocean’s floor. Even with the glitched breakbeat interspersed throughout, the track doesn’t lose its sense of naturalism, instead recontextualising these ultramodern timbres amongst the Eastern instrumentation. Papert has stated in the past that his initial aim of the Mannheim project was to introduce aspects of modern classical to a wider audience, so the extensive inclusion of instruments across time and space is an intentional one.</p>\n<p>Something of a centerpiece to the album, ‘Oubliees’ (roughly, French for ‘forgotten’), is an epic twelve-minute homage to memory and nostalgia, sprinkling half-remembered sepia-toned pianos over an achingly morose modular synth line that whirs like the circuit board of a space shuttle. ‘Schuon’ concludes the LP like the rolling credits of a film. A piano loop skips as if stuck on repeat whilst uncanny, alien vocals chime in to say their farewells.</p>\n<p>At only four tracks and thirty-five minutes, Papert’s debut effort seems cruelly concise, giving us a mere appetiser of his potential future output. As the loops of the final track gradually fade into the backdrop, there is a growing sense that there is a teeming wealth of music of this caliber yet to come from both Papert himself and 3BS more generally. We just can’t see it… yet.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/160165622&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/portals-editions\">Portals Editions</a>\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> 12”/Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 22/09/2014</p>\n<p>Finding information on recent ‘Portals Editions’ signee Shaddah Tuum online is something of a challenge. The pair comprised of Nicolas Lefort and Brandon Rosenbluth have shunned conventional online tools like Soundcloud or Facebook to promote the collaboration, instead letting their debut EP ‘PRTLS 001’ do the talking for them - and a fine job it does of it too.</p>\n<p>As individuals the pair are less illusive, but only slightly so. Lefort has released previously under the guise ‘Niko ‘Shaddah’ Lfo’ creating highly conceptual sonic experiments, inspired by the lineage of Musique Concreté. Rosenbluth on the other hand adopts the guise ‘Xorzyzt’ to represent both his own music and his equally dark, claustrophobic visual work (screenshot above).</p>\n<p>The influence of each are more than obvious on the collaboration, treading a line between precise, razor-edged techno and something akin to drone-metal. The contrast between the grinding, indistinct textures and clinical, sound design heavy rhythms is rather severe. Through opening track ‘Merkabah’ tectonic low-end rumbles menacingly as hissing voices and clattering hits work into an abrasive industrial clangour.</p>\n<p>The second original, ‘S-NInYourHead’, employs a wholly different tact - making a punishing transition in its second half. The opening minutes utilise the precise, Raster Noton indebted beats Lefort frequented on his recent ‘Hanz ■ Memorial’ solo EP. As Shaddah Tuum’s dizzying, static laced rhythms reach their climax however, the track suddenly cuts to a blackened metal chord progression. Stark in it’s contrast, Tuum’s nosediving drones plummet between crumpled drums.</p>\n<p>Those familiar with the work of Dadub will already be aware of their well honed, tribal take on the experimental techno. The remix showcases their signature well; yet it is the final recast from Blueprint signee Samuel Kerridge that steals the show. Drawing on elements from both originals, the Berlin based artist crafts an achingly languid apocalyptic soundscape. Kerridge’s dense, shiftless take on the release calls to mind the work Sunn O))); fuzz caked guitars feel heavily burdened, crawling sluggishly alongside indistinguishable groans and murmurs.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/52147598&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Chookiessss is the name of a Youtube broadcasting platform that is, in the owner’s own words,  “celebrat[ing] shit that’s different and worth listening to”. This is perhaps something of an overly modest manifesto, as Chookiessss has an achingly meticulous style carved out for itself, each upload grasping at an indescribable mood and exacted aesthetic. One way in which Chookiessss has established itself in this way is the careful attention paid to the accompanying artwork – snippets of obscure films, distorted digital art and fuzzy visuals all colour and actualize the message of the music. “I think the experience of listening to music is made so much more powerful and immersive by the accompaniment of visuals, and vice versa”, the channel’s owner muses, noting one particular example used from Gasper Noe’s ‘<em>Enter the Void’</em>, “I love that movie. It’s rare to watch something that leaves you feeling so hollowed out, or at least affects you to that extent (particularly so with <em>Irreversible</em>)”. The channel’s owner is also an established producer in his own right, with an EP release on the horizon, “The EP is called Closed Mouths. I’m really proud of it, so I hope people can hear it at some stage. In terms of what people can expect to hear, it’s quite cinematic, and pretty abstract, but it has an arc, at least in my mind.”</p>\n<p>Despite the unmistakably niche quality that the channel holds, the selections cover a wide range of techno, noise, ambient, industrial and dub. This is reflected in the latest installment of our podcast series, which snakes around the many disparate influences of the channel, all the way from Grindcore Occultists NAILS to the pensive hymns of John Cohen. “I love heavy stuff, like techno and metal, but ambient music has always resonated with me the most, right since when I was little, so the later half of the mix is quite reflective”, he explains. “I’ve grown to love noise, so a lot of that mix is quite abrasive and people might find it hard to listen to. But to me music should be challenging, even if it’s not amazing. Good production goes so far beyond mixing and mastering. It’s about taking risks, and it becomes pretty apparent when you produce who is taking risks and who is playing it safe. The bitter irony is that invariably the people who aren’t taking risks get recognised, and the ones who are making genuinely interesting music largely get overlooked.”</p>\n<p>He’s absolutely right, of course. The majority of the artists featured on the site will likely never get the day in the sun that they deserve. All we can do is be thankful channels like Chookies take the time to champion the dark corners of the Internet, and value the courage it takes to be original.</p>\n<p>Check out the Chookiessss Youtube channel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/chookiessss/featured\">here.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist</strong></p>\n<p>1.

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> <a href=\"http://an-epic.ddz.bz/\">An Epic</a>\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 14/10/2014</p>\n<p>Pokk! is the moniker of futurist-dub artist Martin J Thompson, perhaps best known as the head of the visionary minimal label SM-LL. Almost every release on either SM-LL or from Thompson himself feels like a glass of cold water in a world of fizzy drinks and E-numbers. While the best part of electronic music today is fixated on flooding the mix with hyperactive layers of saturated distortion and effects, Thompson keeps things crystal clear, using just a handful of disparate elements to devastating effect. This EP is no different, taking the listener on a tour around the <em>pathways</em> of London: a kind of resurrection from the lifeless desolation of Abney Park cemetery to the dizzying hubbub of Central Wardour Street.</p>\n<p>What is perhaps most striking about Thompson’s output is his use of tempo. Thompson has a wont for tempos that are <em>really</em> low – tripping the listener up with their striking scarcity. ‘Abney Park’ sets things off like a computer game menu screen – a kind of calm purgatory patiently waiting for you to make your move, reminiscent of Actress’ ‘Harrier Attk’. Eventually, the seductive and heady dub-delay a la ‘Scratch’ Perry envelopes the entire stereo field – bringing a familiar technique to an unfamiliar context.</p>\n<p>You can tell Thompson has a penchant for hardware, as the synths on this EP are exceptionally thick, and each sound feels maximized to the fullest extent. The off-key stabs on ‘Hanway Place’ for example, relentlessly fill every iota of space in the mix, as endless tunnels of echo bustle beneath them. ‘Crouch End’, too, plays on these shimmering in-between-y harmonies, with every component sounding slightly out of tune with the others – a distinctive and alluring feature of the analogue synthesizer. 'Pathways' makes a fitting third chapter in the label's discography, and Thompson's ultra-reduced, sleek take on dub-techno is an incredibly strong move for an imprint that emerged a mere two months ago.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/174522782&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

The hi-end distorts harshly making samples difficult to decipher, whilst the low-end snarls out at awkward intervals. Despite the fact Airsilk’s warped productions are no stranger to rugged, harshly overdriven sounds themselves however, listening to ‘Wicca’, his latest EP between headphones and fully-functional speakers the difference is fairly conspicuous. In short, Airsilk’s production skills are of such a level that his tracks have an exact, engineered quality to them despite the excess of noise and distortion.</p>\n<p>In general there is something slightly unhinged to the entire EP. Undoubtedly its most common ties are found in techno, yet the work here feels less about being dancefloor functional, instead inviting the listener to stand back and simply bask in the sheer physicality of the sound. Take ‘Eight Bisons’ or ‘Bark Replacement’ for example, groaning low-end heaving its way through clamourous percussion. Whilst both tracks maintain a steady rhythm the arrangements are expectedly unconventional; like industrial machinery whirring relentlessly.</p>\n<p>The title track equally bears little in the way of restraint - the space between Airsilk’s pummelling kick drums are flooded with static, snares snapping menacingly in the distance. At the ninety second mark these slightly blurred sounds are jerked into full focus with bone-shattering intensity. Any excess reverb is shed as the full weight of Airsilk’s off-kilter arrangement is unleashed.</p>\n<p>Some degree of orthodoxy is to be found in 138’s remix of title track ‘Wicca’ however, adding a regimented 4/4 stomp without loosing the rugged aesthetics of the original. Fifth Wall signee completes the package with a recasting of ‘Bark Replacement’ similarly seeking to rationalise Airsilk’s derailed approach. A faint melody purrs seductively through a fog of static, vapourous chimes barely audible through Myler’s stumbling rhythms.</p>\n<p>Having put out just a couple of remixes previously, the ‘Wicca’ EP comprises the first complete solo release from Airsilk, presenting a solid representation of his mangled, leftfield approach to techno, of which we hope there are many more to come.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/175219907&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Athenian label Modal Analysis has always seemed keen to keep the circle close. It’s three founding members; ANFS, 3.14 &amp; Kondaktor curate the label tightly, with a strong focus on promoting artists involved in the local scene as much as possible. Explaining more about the origins of the label, Kondaktor considers their ethos. “The basic idea of the label was to promote music from Greek artists that were friends with us. Artists who’s music we really liked but the Greek audience didn’t have a clue about their existence, even if they were doing important things abroad.”</p>\n<p>Having established the label in 2012 alongside promoting local acts, Modal Analysis also quickly developed a reputation for indulging its signee’s more experimental tendencies – their debut ‘Plate’ EP from Cassegrain for example was a far more primordial, stripped down affair than the material the duo have produced for label’s like Prologue or M_Rec. Further releases provided little respite from the darkened, experimental textures, teasing out growling noise-techno from the likes of Sawf, Yves De Mey &amp; AnD.</p>\n<p>Given the leftfield nature of the imprint’s releases, it’s perhaps of some surprise to discover the trio grew up with close links to the dancefloor, attending house &amp; techno raves across the city. Kondaktor and 3.14 also ran parties after meeting in their teenage years, undoubtedly providing the experience with which they are now able to throw Modal Analysis events on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>Between them, their musical backgrounds touch on a wide-range of genres however – each finding their own path to the grainy amalgamation of drone, noise and techno they explore currently. “I was a metal guy, and later I started listening to a lot of hardcore punk/black metal music” ANFS considers when pressed on the subject. “I was really into bands like Nine Inch Nails, Deftones, Russian Circle, Converge, Napalm Death, Burzum and Deathspell Omega, but also liked a lot of the classics like The Smiths, Beatles, Joy Division, The Wipers, Billie Holiday etc.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3942/15757938251_ea35bb8224_z.jpg\" alt=\"kondaktor-krake\"></p>\n<p>Whilst Kondaktor may have shared a fairly similar musical heritage, 3.14 found himself exploring scenes of a very different nature. “I grew up close to my uncle who was playing with different bands across the country back then. He was into psychedelic rock and worked as a piano teacher later on, getting into free jazz stuff. Nowadays he is making electronic music though! In my early teenage years I was following the classic US rap scenes, as well as the local hip hop one. My interest in hip hop beats directed my attention to more electronic oriented productions, until I got into the techno/house ‘culture’. Over the years I always had my influences districted by more experimental and abstract approaches too.”</p>\n<p>A decade or so ago the transition into electronic music wasn’t such a difficult one to make. Now however the Athenian scene is more disparate, as 3.14 reflects when asked bout their early experiences clubbing. “There used to be a lot of different techno parties in the early/mid noughties in Athens, but with Modal Analysis we want to interpret a specific music culture in our own way, genre and aesthetic. Back then we were the ‘young ones’ getting in to the game, but over the years it seems that we managed to show our perspective and offer an alternative way to the Athenian electronic music scene.”</p>\n<p>Further to the varying degrees of clubs and labels operating in the city, the financial crash in Greece also impacted heavily on how the scene in Athens functioned, although as 3.14 points out, in ways which might not have been expected. “On the one hand, the overall financial situation made our job more difficult in terms of the standard label-running expenses, and less income from domestic record sales and our day-jobs. On the other hand, it’s true that such complicated social situations can influence artists and offer them right environment to get creative and express themselves accordingly. During the crisis period there are a lot of new artist hitting the surface of the scene, some of them due to unemployment, some due to inspiration from the chaos around them.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3952/15140397643_b92f291e2e_z.jpg\" alt=\"gayon-modular-fasma-modal-analysis\"></p>\n<p>Indeed, the last few years especially have seen a burgeoning interest in the scene again – a factor which has undoubtedly helped motivate Modal Analysis’ successes. ANFS notes the changes that have occurred. “If you were asking me the same thing two years ago I’d tell you that there is no scene and we are pretty far from having one” he begins. “But in the last two years something has started to happen. There is no actual clubbing scene, and there are only two places in Athens where you can hear some good dance music, but there are some small groups of good promoters trying to book good DJs and make good parties. There are many excellent DJs, and I prefer to hear them play than book a well known DJ that might do a similar thing often worse than the locals do. There is Fasma Festival that George Kondaktor does, and in my opinion it’s really important for the city and for the scene. Also Habeat Records, which is maybe the only techno/house record store in the city, and most importantly I see more and more people producing good music. Actually a network starts to develop, you know people like us, Miltiades, Sawf, and upcoming producers like Nemmett and Morah - we are all somehow connected.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7527/15140403353_50c4f0a480_z.jpg\" alt=\"10557597_812117488822324_5256985824951867968_o\"></p>\n<p>Alongside their work running the label, all three members also produce under their respective pseudonyms – ANFS made up the latest Modal Analysis recently with his debut EP 'Ground', whilst Kondaktor's release history spans back to his harrowing, crumpled noise LP _Broken Boat _for Seattle based Further Records. 3.14 has taken the process more gradually, building up a catalogue of sounds of several years. “Over the last year, or two, I've spending more time working  on my own music than I ever did before. My debut release is coming in December on CLFT, a very authentic label based in Lyon, France. I'm actually building up a kind of library of tracks, most of which are dance-floor oriented - for DJ use. I also enjoy working on my own experiments though; using field recordings and over-produced samples.”</p>\n<p>With ANFS' debut being widely well-received, Modal Analysis' raw, experimental niché in the electronic music scene at large seems in no danger of losing traction anytime soon, with plans for the next record already secured. “The next release will be a live improvisation recording of a new collaboration project of the local electronic music producer - you will learn more info really soon. In meantime we're also preparing some label nights around Europe.”</p>\n<p>For more information visit the Modal Analysis website, <a href=\"http://www.modalanalysis.net/\">here</a>.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/163966213&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Oubys’s latest release is not for those who scare easily, or for those who don’t like to be placed far outside their comfort zone. Created by Wannes Kolf, stage name Oubys, <em>SQM LP Part II</em> is set for release 14th November under Belgium’s <a href=\"http://testtoon.com\">Testtoon Records</a>.</p>\n<p>There’s actually nothing “pleasurable” about <em>SQM LP Part II</em>.  Just like Part I, Part II doesn’t offer a thick and fast release of serotonin. Instead, the thirty three and a half-minute LP forces you into a corner. Opening song <em>Resurrection</em> is relentless in its attack on your senses, and by its end, you’ve lost the battle. Kolf has subjected you masterfully to an oppressive industrial soundscape and he isn’t going to let you go until he’s rinsed your mind free of joy – a process that takes just over thirty minutes…</p>\n<p>This isn’t music for people without patience, either. Instead, this is deadly serious food for thought that promises – right up front – to corrupt the happy places in your head and fill them in with a disease sent from the furthest, darkest recesses of space.</p>\n<p>At times, it squelches and lurches towards you, bleeping at you with ever-increasing ferocity, screaming at you to take off your headphones and hide in a corner until everything is over. At other times, the music appears almost featureless, a carefully constructed drone of sub bass, reverb and affected synth tones – until it comes at you chaotically with cuts of sharp noise that penetrate through the droning mist like a knife penetrating your auditory system.</p>\n<p>Although the opening track of LP, <em>Resurrection,</em> is an aggressive attack on your mind, <em>Restless</em>, the following piece, is Oubys’s way of presenting the listener some amount of respite from sonic bombardment. All the way through to <em>SQM Expanded</em>, the record’s final piece, Kolf plays with your expectations, toying with a dichotomy of aggressive versus suppressive textures that always keeps you guessing. With eerie soundscapes that leave you wondering when the next slice of noise will come from, <em>SQM LP Part II</em> is something like the sonic equivalent of Ridley Scott’s <em>Alien</em>.</p>\n<p>That’s what gripped me most about this collection of songs: the unknowing of it all.  You fear for the harsh industrial sounds that puncture the deep, dark undercurrent of the music, but you also need them. When they arrive, they stir anxiety in you as you pray for their release. It’s like a form of terrible Stockholm syndrome where Oubys is puppet master and the strings are pure noise.</p>\n<p>Finally, as the music faded out into nothingness, Oubys freed me from his suffocating grasp. What sticks with me most about my experience with <em>SQM LP Part II</em> is that although I can’t admit to having fun listening to the music he has created here, I was enraptured by it, needing the next bar, then the next; then the next. If you’re ready to be disturbed and challenged, it comes recommended.</p>\n<p>To celebrate the launch of the LP, Oubys has also crafted a live mix that you can listen to below. It gives a flavor of what Oubys does so well; sculpting together a parasite of noise that will burrow into your brain and stay there for days. Listen below.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"60\" src=\"//www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?feed=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0037-oubys%2F&mini=1&embed_uuid=56feee25-a0a0-4cd8-8552-ce8e9c441a27&replace=0&hide_cover=1&hide_artwork=1&embed_type=widget_standard&hide_tracklist=1\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/0037-oubys/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=resource_link\">0037 // Oubys</a> by <a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=profile_link\">Stray Landings</a> on <a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=homepage_link\"> Mixcloud</a></p>\n",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.houndstoothlabel.com/\">Houndstooth</a>\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> 12”/Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 17/11/2014</p>\n<p>Houndstooth has never been a label that could be accused of predictability. Nitro-charged breakbeat, lo-fi pop and pounding warehouse techno have all made their appearance on the label, so perhaps its little surprise the latest release should be equally divergent from previous offerings. Taking the form of a remix package of Akkord’s ‘HTH020’ EP, Houndstooth has recruited two of the more enigmatic figures in electronic music to adopt the challenge; The Haxan Cloak &amp; Vatican Shadow.</p>\n<p>Those familiar with the original EP will know Akkord used the record to showcase their scientific, exacting take on bass music. Their background in D&amp;B undoubtedly left its mark in the form of ultra-crisp, sub-heavy production. Given this it seems appropriate that the two ensuing remixes should seek to muddy the waters somewhat, injecting some sentiment into Akkord’s somewhat cold-blooded originals.</p>\n<p>Staggering into focus, The Haxan Cloak’s offering draws on elements from all four tracks on the original EP. The recast begins somewhat cautiously - pointed kick drums stuttering between fragmented digital noise and pensive echoes, shrouded in fog. The whiplash inducing drop comes suddenly and without warning; like watching a rocket hurtle to top speed from a near standstill. A cacophony of broken rhythms tumble over one another violently, nauseatingly abrasive drones swarming into the field of vision before easing off, then repeating the motion yet more intensely. To put it bluntly, The Haxan Cloak has crafted one of the most original tracks I’ve heard in some time, stretching Akkord’s tonal palette to the limit of recognition, without quite losing grip entirely.</p>\n<p>Dominick Fernow’s Vatican Shadow remix couldn’t be much more different. Drawing on elements from ‘Typeface’ &amp; ‘Greyscale’ Fernow sculpts the tracks to his own signature effortlessly, reducing the original’s to a brooding, tripped out slab of small-hours techno. Jagged 4/4 rhythms saunter effortlessly between Fernow’s smoke-laced atmosphere’s, the samples opaque and indistinct, again in sharp-contract to Akkord’s razor-edged originals.</p>\n<p>Following recently from the release of one of our favourite LPs of the year - Call Super’s <em>Suzi Ecto</em>, ‘HTH030’ proves Houndstooth to be on exceptional form at the moment, showing an originality rarely matched.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/176707445&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Originally producing under the moniker Kandis, Jens Massel included a track on his debut release named ‘Senking’, a title and a sound which has come to define his most influential project. Under this moniker, Massel has become a veteran of Carsten Nicolai’s legendary Raster Noton imprint, well-known for his glacial, abyss-dwelling take on techno and the more minimal strands of dubstep.</p>\n<p>Having finished his most recent tour, we caught up with Massel to discuss his connection to the UK, the use of hardware, and the ‘4D Soundsystem’.</p>\n<p><strong>So you just finished your tour of South Asia - how was that?</strong></p>\n<p>Great and exhausting! Now the cold I’ve been carrying around for the last four weeks really wants to get out..**<br>\n**</p>\n<p><strong>I noticed that they showed the film, “I Dream of Wires” about analogue synthesis at the ADE festival in Amsterdam, have you seen it?</strong></p>\n<p>Actually I watched the long version before the festival (I think around about four hours) and was very surprised to find myself in it (laughs).</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/85288521&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>  \n<p><strong>You didn’t know you were in it?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s more like I forgot (laughs). I mean it wasn´t an interview or anything like that. They filmed us while we played around with all these very cool machines and Bill from the studio mentioned my name. But I’m happy to be part of it. This goes back a few years when we had a recording session with the guys in Hamilton (close to Toronto). Dean who has all this old analogue stuff set it up for us. I remember they mentioned this documentation, but, they weren’t sure if it really would happen.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you use much hardware yourself?</strong></p>\n<p>No, not much hardware at the moment, but I’m planing on getting more into it again. I like to change my set up every once in a while to come up with new ways of working, and to become less repetitive. I´m noticing more and more that I’m starting to miss using hardware. I never had any old analogue stuff but I always enjoyed connect all kinds of different machines via MIDI and getting inspiration out of the mistakes (laughs).</p>\n<p><strong>I understand you also performed a ‘4D Soundsystem’ set at the festival. Can you tell us a little bit about the set up there? How do they work? Who else is involved?</strong></p>\n<p>With the 4D soundsystem you can move the sound around the space in all kind of ways. Ok, this idea might not sound new, but in the case of the 4D system, for me it is. When I started working with the system, I immediately thought “yes, that´s exactly how I want my stuff to sound”. There are so many possibilities within the system, that my main problem in the beginning was to find a way to work with it, and in a way to limit myself, which in the end always is a good thing for me to do. Sometimes I just need time to find the discipline.</p>\n<p>The sound of the 4D soundsystem works in a natural way, meaning there is sound underneath you, above you, passing by you and so on. In general you´re working with the space. If you´re interested in the whole idea and how it works in detail, I highly recommend you watch this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvM-SxrMv6s\">video</a>.</p>\n<p>There are all kind of ways you can perform using the system. When you ask who else is involved, I want to say once more that the actual set I’m performing on the 4D system is not a set only by me, but by Paul Oomen (the 4D founder) as well. The set wouldn’t be the same without him - I brought the sounds and the composition’s, but as soon as we started to work on the details, Paul came up with so many great ideas that it really became a very fulfilling collaboration for me. I’m very happy with the result.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k114/georgemc25/e8fbe7f2-ebd1-492a-a5b3-c57a1b1d36fc_zps9144e804.jpg\" alt=\"photo e8fbe7f2-ebd1-492a-a5b3-c57a1b1d36fc_zps9144e804.jpg\"></p>\n<p><em>The 4D Soundsystem</em></p>\n<p><strong>I find it really interesting that people are exploring new ways to listen to music like with the 4D thing. What other frontiers do you think are still yet to be conquered in music?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s hard to tell for me. I like music - what it can do to you and your emotions etc. That’s why I loved it so much in the first place. To get there I think you´ll always need an idea for the composition, arrangement, sounds, lyrics etc. The 4D sound for example helps a lot when it comes to sound and dynamic for the Senking material I think.</p>\n<p>But I also listen to music which is much better (of course only my personal opinion) when it comes across in a more lo-fi way. So when you ask about conquering music frontiers I think for me it´s about trying to get the most intensity out of different kinds of music. This can be done in a lot of different ways of course, but in general I think these methods haven´t changed too much.  As I mentioned earlier, the idea of moving sounds isn´t new for me, we just got better with the techniques.</p>\n<p><strong>You’ve had a long connection with Raster-Noton who are now the primary outlet for your productions – when did you first meet Carsten Nicolai and how has your relationship changed over the years?</strong></p>\n<p>I met Carsten, Olaf and Frank sometime in 1999 when they played in my hometown, Cologne. They’d heard my Senking stuff before and liked it, so they asked if I’d be interested in being part of the “20 to 2000” series. Thorsten from “Karaoke Kalk” who released a lot of my stuff was very kind to introduce us.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/47427344&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Looking through your discography it appears there was a four year gap between Senking releases from 2003 – 2007, did you stop producing entirely during this period?</strong></p>\n<p>In this period the “Poto &amp; Cabengo” was released on “Karaoke Kalk”. A CD/vinyl I made together with Michael Cramm. I´m still very happy about that release since the musically fusion between us worked out very well.</p>\n<p>When it comes to Senking it was a time when I ran out of ideas, or let’s say I didn’t know how to develop the whole thing. I think one could call it a crisis!</p>\n<p><em>There are quite a few crossovers between your sound and the dubstep scene which emerged across the noughties - did it have a big impact on you? Do you remember the first time you heard music of that genre? Is the UK close to your heart in this regard?</em></p>\n<p>Yes, this had a very big impact on me. In fact in a way it helped me out of the 'musical crisis’ I mentioned earlier. I mean, it’s not like I want to make dubstep, but for sure you can hear the impact it had when listening to my recent releases. It’s another part of my sound. What I like so much about this kind of 'darker’ dubstep is that it is very minimal, slow, and it makes me dance all night long. I never thought music could do this to me.</p>\n<p>This stuff played on a proper soundsystem makes me a happy camper (laughs). To put it in the words of Loefah “It’s just a big hole with some speakers”.</p>\n<p>The first time I heard this stuff was when Loefah and Skream played in Cologne years ago - these days it’s getting harder to find the kind of events I really like. Everyone stays in while I’m checking out a dubstep party and a lot of the time it’s like &quot;wow, this is dubstep? Maybe I got it all wrong.”</p>\n<p><em>Messel is currently working on his ninth album as Senking, expected for release in 2015.</em></p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/114665763&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> <a href=\"http://liberationtechnologi.es\">Liberation Technologies</a>\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 17/11/2014</p>\n<p>Where can sampling go next? From the codeine-laced beats of ‘Chopped and Screwed’ to the dizzying collages of Plunderphonics and the chin-stroking obscenities of Breakcore, it feels as though the sample has been cut up, pasted, mangled and twisted into every shape and size imaginable. Contemporary artist and musician Lars ‘TCF’ Holdhus, has been putting samples into question once again with his latest release on Liberation Technologies. His early output can be traced back to some bizarre Hip-Hop/R’n’B mash-up tracks under the hugely influential moniker ‘Craxxxmurf’ before shedding the name two years ago. This output was instrumental in pushing the sound that the likes of M.E.S.H, Lotic, Kablam and their ‘Janus’ party have since adopted, if it were possible to pinpoint exactly what that sound ‘is’, which of course it isn’t.</p>\n<p>What is perhaps most striking about TCF’s work is that it’s unclear whether or not samples are being used at all, as each sound instead resides in the ‘uncanny valley’ between the artificial and the biological. In TCF’s world, human voices are digitized, and machines are humanized, until the music becomes a flowing pool of organic and inorganic matter, impossible to disentangle. His mixes are emotionally charged journeys through disparate music spanning decades, as if the listener were a curious music historian from the future (Holdus at one point legally changed his name to Lars ‘The Contemporary Future’ Holdus), nostalgically flicking through the pages of an encyclopaedia and pausing momentarily at irregular intervals. Just looking at TCF’s song titles too, may give you a sense of fatalism in the face of the algorithms we are left to solve. What _are _these? But despite the random-like quality that TCF’s output may appear to have, it is in fact a premeditated, and meticulously arranged structure, engineered to tease out wholly new perspectives from us. We may be looking at data <em>about</em> music, but equally, we may be listening to music _about _data too <em>(see ‘<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/t-c-f/tcf-1000-snares\">1000 snares</a>’)</em>; the music is simultaneously encoded and yet a code unto itself.</p>\n<p>It’s quite nerve racking writing a review of TCF. Whilst I scan his Facebook page, I find to my horror that he has previously picked out and targeted reviews of his own music, explaining with precise articulation where the journalist had gone wrong in trying to understand what he is doing; a bold move that fits in beautifully with the conceptual meta-analysis that his music evokes. Where one writer said of his music that it “sit[s] on the colder side of the electronic divide”, TCF responds:</p>\n<p><em>“When did code, cryptography, chopped vocals and stretch found sounds become cold? Is this a simplistic way of reading another human? What if I consider these things warm or human? The divide between cold (machinic, code etc) and warm (human, electronic analog music (I guess) feelings and emotions) is an old school (read: conservative) understanding of the current world we live in.”</em></p>\n<p>I think he’s right, and what’s more, the decision to critique writing of his music that misses the mark shows a sharpened precision in the message TCF wants to deliver. Perhaps the transmission instilled in the music can never be fully deciphered, but TCF’s vision is not a spontaneous, meaningless jab at ‘weirdness’, but a carefully constructed jigsaw that we can but only gaze at.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/176387478&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> Ripatti\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> 12”/Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 10/11/2014</p>\n<p>New material from any one of Sasu Ripatti’s many guises is something to treat as a rare grace. Extra significance should be afforded to his latest work however - not only is <em>Visa</em> the first album-length release from Ripatti since 2012’s <em>Kuopio</em>, the record also sees Ripatti (under his primary moniker, Vladislav Delay) return to the ambient genre, of which he is something of a master.</p>\n<p>The dynamics Ripatti manages to create with so few components is something which has always set him apart: all too often, ambient music seems to give way to clichéd euphoric builds or sickly cinematic crescendos. In the case of <em>Visa</em> however, it is often just the slight release of a filter, a subtle adjustment made to a loop or an added layer of static that gives narrative to the album. Opening track ‘Visaton’ for instance stretches over twenty minutes in length, yet never feels to be overstaying its welcome. Tape-saturated samples clatter forward like a typewriter stuck on a single character, whilst discordant soundscapes build to a disquieting ascent.</p>\n<p><em>Kuopio</em> was groundbreaking in its injection of rhythm into the ambient genre, using sharply cut harmonic loops and quaking tremolo’s to create rhythm without the need for percussive hits. <em>Visa</em> deploys similar techniques but with a touch more subtlety. For example, ‘Viisari’ murmurs tentatively, as melancholic synths quiver like long grass in the wind. Scratches of static and warbling samples creak beneath the atmospheres; beautifully exposed and fragile. ’Vihollinen’ comes as close to actual percussion as <em>Visa</em> gets, and as the track reaches its climax, hollow snares begin cracking like thunder through the faded piano loops.</p>\n<p>The album’s press release divulges that the record was composed in just two weeks - the Finnish artist having found himself with surplus time after being denied entry to the United States on a planned tour. If this feat were attributed to another artist it might beg belief, yet with the mystique Ripatti has already cultivated over the years through his wildly divergent productions it seems somehow plausible…</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/164675346&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> Vent\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> 12”\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 02/10/2014</p>\n<p>Istanbul based label Vent’s manifesto is a simple one; to provide raw dancefloor-functional techno with the bullshit cut out. With appearances from the likes of DJ Skirt and Miss Sunshine, Vent seem to be taking their mission statement rather seriously, featuring only those artists with a history of delivering heavy duty, early-hours techno weapons. The fourth instalment continues in much the same vein, seeing the union of two previous contributors to Vent’s discography - Tolga Baklacioglu &amp; Ingemar Stalholm, aka Arbiter.</p>\n<p>The EP hangs right on the fringe of conventionality; Baklacioglu’s unhinged rhythms pounding through a mess of jarring analogue bleeps and squelches across opener ‘Resuscitation’. His second offering, ’Startling Neuromancy’, is considerably more downcast, calling to mind Sawlin &amp; Subjected’s collaboration for Electric Deluxe. A rugged 4/4 stomp hammers its way unremittingly through a clutter of gurgling electronics and shudder-inducing drones.</p>\n<p>Stalholm’s contribution’s follow a comparatively more subdued trail, ‘Serenity Now’ centred around discordant atmospheres nagging against the twitching lo-fi drums which stagger across the track’s duration. Given it’s steady, muscular pulse, closing track 'Ziggurat' is nimble and light-footed in contrast. Twisting grooves are warped and mutated as they slink between Stalholm’s thickset percussion, grating sound-design occasionally threatening to disrupt them entirely.</p>\n<p>Vent’s fourth release maintains the succession of rough-edged warehouse techno with an impressively high level of consistency, the interplay between Baklacioglu and Stalholm’s signatures making a fitting balance across the two sides of the release.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/51318796&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"350\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> <a href=\"http://detroitunderground.net\">Detroit Underground</a>\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> Cassette/Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 28/11/2014</p>\n<p>Yu Miyashita takes the form of two very different projects. More recently, he has been composing under his birth name, painting boundless, cinematic soundscapes and employing his craft as a professional sound designer to stretch the imagination far beyond its borders. Much, much more could be written on Miyashita’s ambient work <a href=\"http://www.straylandings.co.uk/post/60644614647/0021-yu-miyashita-yaporigami\">(see here)</a> but it’s his longer running project - Yaporigami - that I’ll concentrate on for the moment. The Yaporigami project is markedly more ‘physical’ than the other, and is grounded in heavy-duty dynamics and painstaking attention to detail. His latest release on Detroit Underground serves as something of a manifesto of this more rhythmically-driven sound; a chapter of his dance floor work enclosed in one release.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that the track names on this EP are variations of the same verb; ’Am’, ‘Is’, ‘Are’, ‘Was’, ‘Were’, ‘Be’, ‘Being’ and ‘Been’, the music of Yaporigami is far from one thing. Take ‘Be’; a nauseating vacuum filled with motor-driven glitches and stomach-turning glissandos of cello, or ‘Was’; a deformed cousin from Objekt’s neo-electro family but underpinned with snarling growls of sub-bass. ‘Is’ lumbers forward haphazardly with giant mechanical steps, whilst the EP’s closer, ‘Been’, feels like a lethargic smack in the face before the final bell of a boxing match. Each time the sound feels graspable, Miyashita moves one step ahead, leading the listener down a garden path before pulling the rug beneath your feet. Even the name of this EP evades total comprehension, each word knocking the reader sideways down a jagged alley; ‘drudged’, ‘torn’, ‘routine’…</p>\n<p>It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly what makes the Yaporigami work stand out. Indeed, it’s difficult to tease out any specific feature of Miyashita’s music that can be isolated and examined more closely. Instead, every idea woven is from the same fabric, each texture intertwined with another, anonymously blending together in stealthy unification. Sure, there are semblances of convention that we may cling to as a listener - the pounding thud of peak-time kicks on ‘Am’, for example - but it’s impossible to separate these features from the overarching structure, so skillfully entwined are the elements of each and every piece.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/174200604&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Tommy Four Seven's productions have never sounded quite like that of his contemporaries. The construction of his 2011 LP <em>Primate</em> perhaps typifies his unique working methods best - restricting himself from using synthesisers and soundbank percussion samples, T47 instead chose to work extensively with a field recorder, capturing all manner of sounds and manipulating them far beyond recognition. Presumably inspired by his work as a sound designer and foley artist, the results proved remarkably effective, contributing to one of the most texturally vivid techno albums out there, demonstrating that technological restrictions can prove immensely effective in the pursuit of originality.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that T47's sound is often associated with German techno scenes, he originally grew up in the UK. Studying music technology in London, he then moved to Berlin with long standing friend James Kronier aka Alain a short time after completing his studies. Last year the pair fulfilled an obligation they made in their student days, releasing an LP of droning, apocalyptic noise under the moniker These Hidden Hands.</p>\n<p>With an appearance on Stroboscopic Artefacts' string of EPs celebrating their fifth anniversary due out shortly, we decided to catch up with T47 to discuss his move to Berlin, These Hidden Hands, and taking Veganism on the road.</p>\n<p><strong>So first off how are things? The latest '5YEARS' EP for Stroboscopic Artefacts is due out in early December – can you tell us a little bit about your contribution to the EP and your relationship with the label more generally? When did you first meet Luca?</strong></p>\n<p>My mind's a little hazy when thinking back to the start of my time in Berlin but I think I’ve known Luca since moving just under six years ago. We came up in the Berlin scene around the same time and we both released our debut albums in 2011, followed by swapping remixes. In 2012 Luca invited me to release an EP for his newly formed Monad series so our working relationship has grown with our friendship.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/164678261&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>You originally grew up in the UK. What were your early experiences of electronic music like, and what were the shortcomings of living here?</strong></p>\n<p>My early experiences of electronic music were during my school years. Jungle/D&amp;B rave cassette tapes such as One Nation and Innovation were always circulating around, as were recordings of House &amp; UKG from pirate stations such as Flex FM. I began mixing when I was fourteen and was getting a lot of old house and techno records form my cousin who married a high profile DJ. So at an early age I was totally intrigued by rave culture, DJs and obsessed with sharing new records with my mates or anyone who'd listened. </p>\n<p><strong>Your collaboration with James Kronier (Alain), 'These Hidden Hands' seemed to be your biggest project of last year, can you tell us a little bit about your relationship with James? The bio for your label 'Hidden Hundred' suggests the collaboration was a large part of your move to Berlin in the first place...</strong></p>\n<p>Alain and I met whilst studying Music Technology at what is now the University of West London. I was really impressed by his productions and after hanging out we found we had a lot of common tastes, especially in D&amp;B and we decided to write some tracks together, the first being for my now defunct label, Shooting Elvis, entitled ‘Strix'. We clicked in the studio and as our time at university drew to an end we thought about writing an album together. At this time I was DJing a lot in and around London but felt trapped musically. After a short visit to Berlin in 2008, I decided Berlin offered more opportunities and seemed more artistically friendly. Alain spontaneously decided to join me as he was a bit fed up in London at the time anyway, and we formed this big vision of writing a collaborative album. But with all the hurdles which come with moving to a new country, and our own individual commitments, it ended up taking a bit longer to come to fruition than we originally intended.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/15753296298\" title=\"These-Hidden-Hands 2 by straylandings, on Flickr\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/15753296298\" title=\"These-Hidden-Hands 2 by straylandings, on Flickr\"><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7526/15753296298_0e24a528bf_z.jpg\" alt=\"These-Hidden-Hands 2\"></a>\n<em>These Hidden Hands</em></p>\n<p><strong>Your sound-design based approach to production is rather unique, and I can imagine being quite far removed from how many other producer’s work. How do you find the collaboration process generally? Do you have to change your working methods at all</strong>?</p>\n<p>I like to mix things up and also let myself be inspired by other producers and engineers - collaborations are a great way to create new methods and to bounce new ideas around. But when collaborating with Alain as These Hidden Hands, we already know each other's ways of working so well, it was actually more productive to first write in our own studios separately, taking it in turns to adapt each others ideas until we reached something we were both feeling. Then once solid foundations had already been laid for a song, we'd often continue the final stages together in the same studio.</p>\n<p><strong>Is there more material planned from the two of you or are you trying to focus on the T47 stuff more again now?</strong></p>\n<p>We’ve taken a small break to give space to our other projects. I recently launched a new event series called ’47’ at Arena Club, Berlin which will also serve as a label supporting the various guests and I’m also working on finishing some much needed solo material. Alain and I do have a new album in the pipeline and we will do a few more live shows once it’s finished but we don’t pressure ourselves as from the very start, These Hidden Hands was conceived purely as a project for us to collaborate on uncompromised music that we wanted to make, and doesn't have any other specific goal or commercial motivation behind it. </p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/110904793&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I believe I am right in saying you are a fellow Vegan! Is it a struggle to maintain what with touring so intensely? I know it's a concept that is almost non-existent in certain countries...</strong></p>\n<p>Yes you are right! I find it's never a struggle to maintain as I can't imagine eating anything but vegan, however it can be difficult to eat delicious vegan food when traveling. That said it's getting better year by year as more people are becoming aware. Normally the first thing I do when arriving in a city is to check a phone app called Happy Cow which shows the nearest vegan and vegan friendly restaurants (a recent life saver in Japan). Many restaurants serve vegan food without knowing what vegan means, or have enough ingredients to just get creative. If there's really absolutely nothing good to eat, you've got to have a back up plan. For me that's normally fruit! </p>\n<p><strong>Do you think DJing so regularly impacted your productions as well? Do you think it encourages you to produce more dancefloor friendly music or sends you the other way?</strong></p>\n<p>DJing regularly does impact my productions to an extent but I try not to let the 'dance-floor' thing influence me in the studio. In the past when I have tried to write something intentionally 'dance-floor' I soon end up loosing interest so I've found that I feel much more satisfied and get better results when I write what comes to me and when I'm writing for myself only. </p>\n<p><strong>Finally what can we expect to hear from you in the next few months? Any new projects in the works?</strong></p>\n<p>The last production from me this year is the track I've contributed to Stroboscopic Artefacts 5<sup>th</sup> anniversary EP series. I feature on the third EP together with Xhin, Kangding Ray and Dscrd which should be dropping 8<sup>th</sup> Dec on wax and download.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/178375476&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

His ‘Route of Pain’ EP on Len Faki’s legendary ‘Figure’ imprint reflected the power and strength of some of Shed’s early releases, and caught the attention of techno guru Truncate, who has since remixed the entire EP. It’s perhaps important not to overstate Poncet’s output as something trying to be particularly conceptual or boundary pushing, rather, his work focuses on exacting the art of the perfect tool - a task left to the reserve of only the most talented techno technicians out there.</p>\n<p>The record opens with ‘Walfisch’, which holds a markedly straighter groove than his previous broken-beat efforts. Again, you can hear Shed’s gravitational influence on Poncet, as the dub stabs echo and shimmer around the stereo field, creating a dazzling hall-of-mirrors effect. However, for me it’s ‘Afterglow’ that really steals the show on this release; an eery and frantic pulsator reminiscent of some of the more obtuse output from Tobias or Tom Dicicco.</p>\n<p>There can be few things less daunting than having producers like Robert Hood or Psyk contribute to your EP - afterall, the sheer titanic fame that they possess and their years of presence in the scene has every possibility of eclipsing the original tracks that are meant to be the focal point of the release. This can be a real problem, I think, with early releases, as there is a sense in which underground music is unlikely to be recognised until it’s standing, not on, but alongside the shoulders of giants. Thankfully I don’t think this is true in the case of Poncet. Despite his impressive affiliations with some of the world’s best - Truncate, Len Faki, Robert Hood, Psyk… Poncet’s work can stand tall on it’s own merits, and in the case of this EP, can even overshadow the giants.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/56809694&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

Despite collaborating with the now ludicrously famous James Blake at their seminal 1800-Dinosaur nights, Klaus has never appeared to ride on Blake’s wave of fame. To do so, I think, would be out of character, or at least at odds with his disposition. Where Blake expands his sound to almost unbearable sizes, Klaus keeps things on the short and narrow with barely audible static and subtle shifts in mood.</p>\n<p>What I think is most impressive in Klaus’ work is his ability to generate aching tension using only a handful of delicate elements, and if his early work was considered sparse, then this latest EP is skeletal in the extreme. His trademark use of static here creates windy, cold sounding music, and the broken beats invoke a purposefully nostalgic rumination on dubstep. Take the opening ‘Delta’ for instance, with its sorrowfully sparse layout out or personal highlight ‘Luc’ with its warbling underbelly of sub. None of these tracks dramatically progress in any one direction, nor do they need to. Instead, they are simply ‘there’, present and unmoving, like the scenery of a film.</p>\n<p>Klaus’ meticulous approach to releases is also beautiful in its simplicity. Speaking to him earlier last year about his own imprint, he addressed the ethos of the label; “the basic idea is to put out 12”, 45rpm records, you know, no bullshit, no art, cut as wide as possible.” This ‘no bullshit’ spirit makes every release feel unique, and his latest record is no less special.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/63213836&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Few acts manage to remain so unrestrained in their explorations of electronic music as Italian duo Retina.it. Comprised of Lino Monaco &amp; Nicola Buono, the pair have spent over two decades mastering the capabilities of their bewildering array of hardware, producing music which touches on drone, ambient, glitch, house and techno in equal measure.</p>\n<p>Having released one of our standout EPs of the year, the brooding, dubbed-out ‘Ops-ci’ tape, we decided to invite the Pompeii based duo to provide the final ‘That Time When’ of 2014, discussing five of their most memorable live music experiences.</p>\n<p>1# ##Rome_1985##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7512/15884118149_a13fb81f4a_z.jpg\" alt=\"1\"></p>\n<p>Me and three of my old friends decided to go and see Sister’s Of Mercy in Rome, where we knew we’d be transported into another dimension quite different from our day-life. There wasn’t much to do in our area and not much music on offer, so we have to travel a lot to attend shows. Sister’s atmospheres and synthetic drumming totally caught us. The show was held in a Roman theatre with the mood of a batcave - I was totally submerged into the new-wave era sounds.</p>\n<p>2# ##Treviso_1985##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8650/16069508312_53f59f5a1e_z.jpg\" alt=\"2\"></p>\n<p>This was an unforgettable experience for me. More than twenty years ago I decided to spend a vacation with my art curator uncle in Milan. I was by myself and didn’t know anyone around there. I kew that in Treviso, not far from Milan, there would be an Einsturzende Neubauten show, so I decided to start my trip.</p>\n<p>I travelled by train and arrived early in the afternoon. I asked around but people seemed not to know about the gig, someone told me that there were maybe two places used for concerts. I didn’t know how to reach the venue by bus so I started my long march. While I was walking a guy in a car asked me if i was searching for the venue too, so I joined him for the journey. Finally we found it. In punk-style leather jackets and military shoes we were dissolving in an afternoon’s hot sun, when we watched the EN guys get out from a van and start to move their huge industrial instruments. We were there astonished! Then one of them - I guess he was Alexander Hacke, looked at us and said “you guys come inside”.</p>\n<p>Watching the gig was so emotional… After the concert I slept in the train station and only realised the day after that it wasn’t just a dream.</p>\n<p>3# ##Napoli_1996##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7578/15884440057_eb2f424d5d_z.jpg\" alt=\"3\"></p>\n<p>I think Zen Paradox was the first gig that inspired our passion for analogue equipment. It was the first time I saw them all together; an Arp Odyssey, a TB-303 and a TR-808 - all modified, they had a MIDI sync!</p>\n<p>After several DJ sets, Zen arrived on the stage behind his machines. He started playing, letting the machines communicate with one another. At that time it was difficult to see a hybrid set between analogue and digital equipment. The MIDI protocol was new, and in ‘96 very few were producing MIDI/CV interfaces. It was an hour of pure and intense trance music that let me fly across ancestral soundscapes… we had a dear old time!</p>\n<p>4# ##Rome_2002##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7531/16070202465_e880acf756_z.jpg\" alt=\"4\"></p>\n<p>We went to Rome, to see Pan Sonic play alongside F.M Einheit. Inevitably I was close to the stage, and it was a devastating mix of sounds. I knew how good Pan Sonic sound, because I’ve been familiar with their music in the past. The relationship between them and one of industrial music’s fathers, F.M. Einheit was incredibly intriguing.</p>\n<p>With his set of industrial machines - drills, springs and bricks, he crafted sounds that interweaved with the futuristic vision of Pan Sonic. The amazing thing was seeing him smash the bricks on a large metal plate and each piece that fell off the table seemed perfectly synchronised with the steady, geometric beats of the Finnish duo.</p>\n<p>5# ##Napoli_2005##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7518/15882776528_723365bba5_z.jpg\" alt=\"5\"></p>\n<p>A few years ago we started a project called “Resina” with our friend, Neapolitan musician Mark Messina. He is the founder of the historic Italian band 99 Posse. After the release of our Resina LP <em>Opinio Omnium,</em> we were invited to open a concert for Kraftwerk, and what better opportunity could there be to attend such a show? The performance was at the Arena Flegrea in Naples, a venue created in the Art Deco style - the long symmetrical  lines and white stone seemed perfect for a show as rigorous as that of Kraftwerk.</p>\n<p>After our performance we were about to move our equipment from the wings, when in the corner of my eye I saw Ralf Hütter approach Nicola extending his hand, and he was astonished. It was amazing, and the fact that we’d performed as part of a historic Neapolitan event with one of the groups that have been key in the evolution of electronic music, made our experience metaphysical.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>In the wider world, 2014 has been somewhat of a shitstorm – ISIS, Ebola, Ukraine, Future Islands on Letterman - and certainly won’t be looked back upon as a vintage year for humanity. Whilst the species at large continues to disappoint however, the fringes of electronic music have proved to be as fertile as ever, and in our little bubble we’ve enjoyed some real treats over the past twelve months. Like last year, our end of year summary isn’t a list or rundown of the year’s best releases, but is instead a collection of a few choice things that have defined 2014 for us. It is by no means meant to be exhaustive, rather a snapshot of our year in music. Enjoy.</p>\n<p>###Bloc Returns</p>\n<p>It feels almost perverse having people like Regis and Surgeon play in somewhere like Autumn Street Studios now. Even the geography of Autumn Street itself feels as though it should be the home to emerging (rather than renowned) talent, centred in the in-between-y bit of an Industrial complex in Hackney Wick. Surgeon in particular has emerged as an even bigger celebrity DJ in the last year thanks to <em>that</em> performance supporting Lady GaGa... And yet, as a venue, Autumn Street’s booking policy has of late been refreshingly purist in its selection of techno, with a clear set of principles in mind, peeling all of techno’s unnecessary layers off to reveal its humble core: the drum machine. That night, Regis and Surgeon stripped the sound back - rarely if ever looping more than three elements at any one time - such that even the most subtle of changes gave way to roars of euphoric cheers. The will power it must take to hold the tension with such few components must be extraordinary, and it’s a joy to witness it.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that this most recent gig is just one instance of Bloc excelling with meticulously programmed events, throughout the year having brought the likes of Green Velvet, Model 500, Scion &amp; Tikiman - names which scarcely if ever appear on UK billings. Further to this the promoters announced both the reinstatement of their yearly festival since and their return to Minehead Butlins, a venue which served them well until 2012's disastrous attempted expansion to the only partially completed development. If you'd asked me around the time, I would have imagined recovering from an incident of such magnitude impossible, yet with sheer determination, Bloc have recovered lost ground with incredible grace, and with names like Autechre, Jeff Mills &amp; The Moritz Von Oswald Trio already included on the festival lineup, and attending feels like something of an obligation.</p>\n<p><em>George McVicar, Theo Darton-Moore</em></p>\n<p>###DJ Rashad</p>\n<p>I did question whether to include the late DJ Rashad - who tragically died at the age of 34 in April - in a collection of our highlights of the year, but his passing should be taken as an opportunity to celebrate his work, and I found myself returning to his ecstatic, mind-twisting music in the wake of his death. It is a little jarring that outside of Chicago Rashad, an ambassador for a style of music not typically listened to in the LP format, will in a large part be remembered by his exceptional run of three albums that began with 2011’s 'Just A Taste Vol. One', through 2012’s 'Teklife Volume 1', and concluded with 2013’s 'Double Cup'. However across these records (and elsewhere of course) Rashad showcased some of the most vital dance music I’ve heard in recent years, and displayed a virtuosity across a range of productions styles unmatched by his contemporaries. He sounded just as comfortable programming brittle, hyperactive snares, as he did making the lush, heady sounds on later records, which drew influence from US hip-hop and from another bonkers dance that originated across the Atlantic – jungle. Rashad was one of the most talented musicians in an electronic music scene that is in many ways international, and he made music that was paradoxically location specific but also outwards looking, peering through a shroud of swirling intoxication.</p>\n<p><em>Rob Heath</em></p>\n<p>###Copenhagen Trip</p>\n<p>It's amazing what you can pack into five days. Having flown out to meet SonuoS founder &amp; DJ Finn Albertsson on one of his frequent trips to perform at Culture Box, (this time billed alongside Luke Slater and dub-techno pioneer Fluxion) it quickly became apparent how vibrant the city's music culture is as a whole. Through our contact online Albertsson has been something of a guiding light, exposing some of the darkest and most obscure recesses of electronic music. In person he is an equally good host, pointing out hotspots that might take weeks to discover otherwise. Visiting a city's record stores can often provide a good barometer of where musical interests lie, and as the selections available from the likes of Dorma 21 or Sound Station reflected, listening tastes are incredibly open - Ukranian drone, doom metal or the more experimental corners of dub-techno for example not things I find a great deal of in the UK.</p>\n<p>Without wanting to aggrandise the city too much, it is hard not to note the enthusiasm of those people I encounters on my travels, showing a genuine openness towards others expressing an interest in the same music scene. Maybe it comes as a byproduct of living in a place not so over-saturated with producer's, DJs, journalists etc. as London. Regardless of the reasons though, the buzz it generates is hard not to be touched by, and probably the reason I was able to make it out to an event every night I was there, including before my Saturday morning flight back, Albertsson's mantra - 'you can sleep when you're dead' still rattling around my brain.</p>\n<p><em>Theo Darton-Moore</em></p>\n<p>###Bohren &amp; Der Club of Gore – Piano Nights</p>\n<p>I’ve heard Bohren &amp; Der Club of Gore, a German group composed of members of various Doom Metal groups, described as ‘ambient jazz’, which is to an extent quite accurate but also makes it sound like you might find them performing live on an episode of The Culture Show on BBC2. However despite having some of the smooth edges and gorgeous, gentle textures you’d expect from an ‘ambient jazz’ album, Piano Nights is an extremely intense and deeply sad record, and not the sort of thing you’d find on breezy late night chat show. It can be soothing, it can be uncomfortable, and this is because it all moves along very, very slowly. I spent a lot of time listening to frantic, hyperactive music this year (see DJ Rashad above), and this record acted as a beautiful, melancholic counterpoint.</p>\n<p><em>Rob Heath</em></p>\n<p>###Vladislav Delay - Visa</p>\n<p>It’s hard to confess but ‘Visa’ was my first taste of Sasu Ripatti under the guise of the Vladislav project. To be honest, I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect, just a cursory glimpse at the track listing makes it look like a Sunn 0))) record - 22-minute opener? What is this? - and the record itself is no less puzzling. Visa guides you cautiously through a rich banquet of bizarre sonic experiments, each sounding at once meticulously crafted and yet wholly improvised. What’s so nice about the album is that it’s such a ‘warm’ sounding record and yet distinctly mechanical. It’s how I imagine music would sound if computers capable of making it for their own enjoyment. Indeed, I get the feeling that my computer even ‘enjoys’ playing Visa… who says androids don’t dream of electric sheep anyway?</p>\n<p><em>George McVicar</em></p>\n<p>###Adam Bohman</p>\n<p>I have to admit I’m including London-based improviser Adam Bohman for not just strictly musical reasons. Bohman had his first public exhibition of his visual art his year, at Café Oto’s Project Space in the autumn, and I thoroughly enjoyed browsing his wonderfully detailed and lurid collages, which he has been making privately for decades. To keep it musical, some of these collages were gig posters he had designed for the London Improvisers Orchestra, and I saw him perform as part of the trio Secluded Bronte with his brother Jonathan and Richard Thomas at Café Oto in June, performing live scores for the films of Walerian Borowczyk as part of a wonderful evening dedicated to the late Polish director. He also put out some great releases too, including the entertaining 'Music and Words 2', so it was a triumphant year.</p>\n<p><em>Rob Heath</em></p>\n<p>###Madteo @ Dance Tunnel [17.10.2014]</p>\n<p>You can never quite be sure what to expect seeing Queens based Matteo Ruzzon, aka Madteo DJ. His ‘Street Wax’ mix series illustrate the point well, darting between all manner of genres, from funk and disco, to breakbeat, hip-hop and techno as if there were no difference between them. During the Italian born producer’s visit to London's Dance Tunnel however, a turbo charged mix of rough-edged house &amp; techno was the only thing on the agenda.</p>\n<p>The capital sometimes feels like it’s lost something in terms of its nightlife, smaller often being overpowered by wealthy promoters and large capacity venues. 'Way Back Here's night at the Dalston based venue proved that the simplest of formulas is often the most satisfying; a Funktion One coupled with solid mixing and selections begged no additional frills or gimmicks. The intimacy of the venue proved another factor adding rather than detracting from the event, making Ruzzon's contagiously energetic DJing style inescapable.</p>\n<p><em>Theo Darton-Moore</em></p>\n<p>###Tim Hecker @ Berlin Atonal</p>\n<p>Since 2013’s phenomenal Virgins, Hecker’s sound has centred around building endless layers of scattered and fragmented components. In the live setting, Hecker orchestrates hundreds of splintered pianos, organs and static to slam into one another, as if constructing a towering block of Jenga pieces before crashing them to the ground. In Atonal’s colossal ‘Kraftwerk’, this effect is magnified tenfold, as the titanic concrete walls resonant the frequencies into every iota of space of the venue. As the building creaked and rumbled, Hecker’s set seemed to turn the already ghostly space into something of a haunted house, and gave audience members a very special headspace in which to reflect on the festival.</p>\n<p><em>George McVicar</em></p>\n<p>###Tesla Tapes</p>\n<p>Tesla Tapes, run by the group Gnod as an outlet for group members’ various individual projects, fills my quota this year for noisy and droney electronic music dragged out of (or through) the gutter. Tesla Tapes occupy similar musical territory to Irish label Trensmat, who I included in this feature last year, and I actually lauded Trensmat in particular for releasing a record from Gnod. Clearly I’m a creature of habit, much as like to laud myself for having an interest in the experimental. To my shame I don’t yet own a single Tesla Tapes cassette - although I’ve perused their catalogue extensively on Bandcamp - so buying one of their tapes can be a nice easily achievable 2015 resolution for me. In particular this year I enjoyed Sister / Body’s 'Lucifer Efekt'.</p>\n<p><em>Rob Heath</em></p>\n<p>###Downliners Sekt - Silent Ascent</p>\n<p>Downliners Sekt seem to be one of the few remaining outfits able to bring me to childish levels of excitement through their releases. The Spanish duo have managed to rationalise an incredibly wide spectrum of influences in the past - from breakbeat and hip-hop to shoegaze rock, yet their April released LP Silent Ascent felt like the most gracefully finesse'd release yet.</p>\n<p>In short, anything that sounds like it'd fit in amongst the legendary Chain Reaction back-catalogue is going to earn decent marks from me - 'Silent Ascent's pulsating, vapourous atmospheres and hypnotic, off-beat percussion fitting the bill perfectly. The use of sample manipulation and found sounds have been a staple of the pair's work up till now, however the interplay between this and more organic, live elements such as their opulent washes of synthesiser or use of live drumming put Silent Ascent in a different league altogether.</p>\n<p><em>Theo Darton-Moore</em></p>\n<p>###Fort Process</p>\n<p>My standout event of the year was Fort Process, a one day event of performances and installations of avant-garde music and sound art, in the sprawling passages and chambers of Newhaven Fort, a 19th Century fortification on the South coast of England. The event’s capacity was kept purposefully low so as to avoid overcrowding, and the programme was so extensive that it was impossible to see everything. Stumbling across performances and installations thus felt like a process of exploration, and for much of the day I chose not to consult the programme but instead just wander the site. John Butcher’s evening performance in an old weapons cache was a particular highlight, as was the closing performance from Peter Brotzmann and Steve Noble, which drew the biggest crowd of the day. Ex-Easter Island Head were fantastic as ever, and Ingrid Plum, Boldie, and Plurals were all new discoveries for me.</p>\n<p><em>Rob Heath</em></p>\n<p>###Jan Jelinek &amp; Masayoshi Fujita @ Cafe Oto [22.11.2014]</p>\n<p>Seeing micro-house pioneer Jan Jelinek has been an ambition of mine for a good few years now, so when the opportunity to watch him perform live alongside vibraphonist Masayoshi Fujita arose in late November, there was little deliberation needed. Trips to Cafe Oto can feel a little too much like a long hard stare in the mirror at the best of times, being often quite indulgent for want of a better word. Yet as is also common with the venue, the quality and depth of the music being performed makes its admittedly rather artsy context hard to care about too much.</p>\n<p>Taking to the stage after an amazingly creative supporting performance from Isnaj Dui (Katie English), Jelinek and Fujita blurred a dizzying array of influences into one cohesive soundscape. Musique Concréte and Krautrock influences felt as present as the micro-house and lo-fi electronic eccentricities that made Jelinek's name in the first place. The duo's improvisation’s were carried out with effortless precision; the performance could have been recorded straight to tape without any concessions made for the fact everything was happening on the fly. I guess at least in Jelinek's case this is the level of skill that should come to be expected from an artist that has been pushing his craft for well over a decade, still it was something quite breathtaking to see in the flesh.</p>\n<p><em>Theo Darton-Moore</em></p>\n<p>###Objekt - ‘Ganzfeld</p>\n<p>I’m probably not the best person to write a review of an Objekt tune. My admiration for his back catalogue is unmatched by almost anyone that I can think of, and my habits of listening back to his series of EPs is bordering on obsessive. Even my own productions feel as if they always end up sounding like Objekt rip-offs, so it’s difficult to really have an objective stance on his new material. Nevertheless, as I listen back to 'Ganzfeld' now, I still find myself with my hands on my temples, despairing - how is he doing that? - and a sense of righteousness about it too, thinking; 'this is what electronic music should be about'. ‘Ganzfeld’, I think, is a culmination of everything Objekt is good for; the hyper-engineered glitches, the expansive strings, those bass synths… and it brought with it a resurrection of the 90’s Warp sound and ethos that got me into this stuff in the first place.</p>\n<p><em>George McVicar</em></p>\n<p>###Head High- Megatrap</p>\n<p>Having been a fan since turning to a friend and slurring “what’s this? It’s dope” I was as excited as anyone was about the release of Head High's album this year. Expecting both nostalgic and unashamedly anthemesque techno, I wasn’t disappointed with the combination of drums and chords that can make even the staunchest of chin strokers whip off their shirt and hug anyone whose limbs fly into a three foot parameter. In a year with so many techno artists releasing albums I couldn’t say it’s the most adventurous release of the year but it is one which seems to undercut the moodiness and delivered a smile to the face and a fist to the air, making it a release which I enjoyed immensely this year.</p>\n<p><em>Owen Lewis</em></p>\n<p>###Mica Levi - Under the Skin OST</p>\n<p>So fervently had I been anticipating the return of Mica Levi (of Micachu &amp; The Shapes) since her criminally underrated ‘Never’, that I completely missed her scoring of what was arguably one of the best films of the year, ‘Under the Skin’. Unlike most soundtracks, Levi’s comes out at you in bold swipes, never fully sitting comfortably within the film nor completely removed from it. The creaking glissandos and dry percussive thumps don’t meander in the background nor simply colour the mood of the film. Instead, the soundtrack is a character unto itself, a tangible component of the film with its own questionable motives and personality. The bizarre death scenes, for example, that happen throughout the film are populated not only by Scarlett Johansson and her various victims, but also by a spin-tingling violin motif that sounds like the grim reaper sharpening a scythe. Indeed, if this soundtrack is a character in the film, it’s Death itself, moving facelessly behind the screen before snatching another victim. Few pieces of music had the same staying power that this did for me in 2014.</p>\n<p><em>George McVicar</em></p>\n<p>###Happy 5th Birthday: Stroboscopic Artefacts</p>\n<p>At the end of every year I find myself reflecting on the music that has stuck with me over the last 12 months, and Stroboscopic are rarely, if ever, omitted from my memory, so continuously innovating is the labels output. But two ‘moments’ in particular from Stroboscopic strike me as pivotal in 2014; Sendai’s contribution to the legendary Monad Series, and the 5th anniversary party at Corsica Studios with Perc, Rrose and label owner Lucy. Both of these left me inspired for days but for different reasons. First, Sendai expanded the borders of what I thought was doable in electronic music, taking the staples of techno and ascending them to previously unimagined heigts. The party at Corsica by contrast surprised me by how precisely contained the sound was; for a line up renowned for their esoteric sonics experiments, they still somehow knew how to shake a dance floor to its foundations. This ability - to transcend the familiar and familiarise the transcendental - is something that I think will continue to rank Stroboscopic among the best for years to come.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Given its prominence in recent years, it’s hard to imagine periods when techno was seen as something outdated, over-played and generally unfashionable. Whilst they may be bracketed by the genre in the loosest way possible, Swedish label Kontra-Musik are an imprint that have seen electronic music through hard times, as founder Ulf Eriksson explains when asked about the label’s origins. “In Sweden at that time, dance music was so unpopular. Techno or rave was considered to be something very ugly.”</p>\n<p>Despite the fact Eriksson had clear plans for a label from the outset, Kontra originally began as an event series, bringing all manner of artists to his hometown of Malmö – a City at the time otherwise fairly void of any discernible music scene. “The first party was packed actually - we had Sonia Moonear playing and it went very well” he begins when asked about the early Kontra events. “She was sort of connected to Gigolo (DJ Hell’s label) back then and it was very hyped. Also people are always curious when there is a new club emerging - the first night is easy, the second night is much harder. In one of the earlier events we also had Tikiman with Scion live. Not at all the same crowd I remember, even if the booking was much bigger. What I tried to do back then was to move the electronic music scene from the shadows into the light, sort of. I wanted to move the scene from the underground into normal clubs and venues. I wanted to make the music I loved so much, more available.”</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/163403503&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p>Although the label side of Kontra has definitely come to most strongly define it as an entity, events are something Eriksson continues to run in the City, largely at ‘Inkonst’ – the venue where he works as an Artistic Director, but also in other lesser known spots around Malmö. The ability to still put on successful parties in the City may provide the greatest indicator of the health of the electronic music scene in Malmö, as the label side of Kontra has gone on to achieve much wider recognition across Europe.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8674/15926424559_7f75a876be_z.jpg\" alt=\"JES_2698\"></p>\n<p>Besides, while there may have been many shifts and changes in Malmö over the years, where the current climate is concerned, Eriksson is positive about in his outlook. “The scene in Malmö is moving back underground after a few years in the spotlight sort of, but not because people are not into it” he reflects. “Still, I would say the scene is bigger (still small) than ever here in Sweden. Moving back to the underground is more of a DIY movement I would say. People are sick and tired of all the rules, restriction and costs of running things legally here in Sweden. So as a reaction to that, people take things in their own hands and throw their own parties. I would say it is a very healthy development. In Malmö there are also lots of labels emerging right now, but I do not think that is something particular for Malmö. It is just a thing that people do today. To have your own record label is as common as, lets say, being a vegetarian. It is the DIY mentality again.”</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/32875338&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p>Over its near decade long existence, Kontra has constantly redefined and adapted itself, being careful never to restrict itself in terms of sound. This is likely a reason for the label’s enduring success even with the aforementioned increase of competition, although by Eriksson’s count, it sounds like this was just a logical process of progression rather than a calculated ploy to maintain relevance. “I would say it is impossible for me to stick with one sound” he muses. “I am attracted to so much music so why limit myself? If some music falls into my lap that I find attractive in some way, it would be stupid not to release it. That would be to limit the possibilities to get music out there. I kind of think that maybe the greatest thing about Kontra, is that it is not so self-conscious. It is so much without strategy. That makes the label and the releases very honest in some way. Also, when starting this label I made a promise to my self to do this for a long time. And if you want to do a label for a long period of time, you better do not put any barriers on the sound. Things are moving extremely fast, trend cycles are accelerating more and more every year. A label stuck to one specific sound will not survive very long.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7509/16111758882_a26f4a1f3f_z.jpg\" alt=\"10635868_339158642926141_2171330781862173424_n\"></p>\n<p>Indeed, Kontra’s RA page states its aim as to ‘bring “music” back into electronic music’ – something clearly audible in the glacial, meandering synthplay of TM404’s ‘Svans’, or the Durian Brother’s recent experiments with prepared turntables, ‘Das Macht Modern’. Given this it’s perhaps unsurprising that Eriksson’s listening habits as he explains when asked on the origins of his interest in music, extend far beyond just the metronomic 4/4 pulse of techno. “I came into the [electronic music] game very late to be honest - like ‘96 I started to get into it maybe. Before that I was always into band-based music, like punk, jazz, rock, pop and hip-hop. Today I listen to a lot of electronic music for sure, that is my job, but all kinds of music is coming out of my speakers.”</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/168124793&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p>Whatever the reasons behind Kontra’s diversity, it is a factor that has obviously resonated with the label’s supporters, and something also reflected in the collaborations between Kontra and other figures in the Swedish electronic music scene, of which there are many. Whilst not preaching any sort of exclusivity, there is no doubt that the label has made some effort to support the local scene and artists – for example collaborating with Stockholm based Skudge recently, putting out a split artist EP under the name ‘Skum’.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7477/15492794573_94f32545a5_z.jpg\" alt=\"kontra-musik\"></p>\n<p>Andreas Tilliander is another artist with whom Kontra has worked with on a repeat basis, although by as Eriksson discusses, it sounds like relations have improved considerably since their first encounter. “Tilliander and I have known each other for a long time” he responds when asked about their initial meeting. “I do not remember when, but I organised an outdoor rave once in Malmö. Andreas was booked as Bulgur Brothers, a trio he had together with Mikael Stavöstrand and Johan Skugge. Back then Tilliander was sort of a pop-star in Sweden, so the same night he performed solo at the Malmö Festival, a yearly and in many ways horrible festival, organised by the city. Anyway, Andreas and his friends showed up at our party super drunk and not cool at all. He fell asleep in a sofa behind the stage and never performed. I was pissed of. After that we became really good friends (laughs). This is how we actually met for the first time and one of our favourite Kontra-Musik anecdotes. There are a few by now…”</p>\n<p>Alongside his releases under monikers such as Mokira TM404, Tilliander has also mastered several of the Kontra releases, including the most recent – a field recording heavy dub-techno EP from Italian producer Roberto Clementi.</p>\n<p>Beyond this, Eriksson seems to have pretty well sculpted ideas for the label's release schedule, despite the increased difficulties of running a label in the current climate. “After [the Clementi EP] we have a new white label release, this time with Villa Åbo who is one third of Frak and the guy behind the Börft label. It is really good one. Then me and Sebastian Mullaert from Minilogue are working on a mix-album together. We do this act where I DJ and he play live. So this will be out as well. I think that is all that is planned right now. It is pretty hard to run a label these days. Every week there are like one million new releases, one thousand new labels and a hundred less vinyl buyers. I do not think I can afford this much longer now.”</p>\n<p>Keep upto date with Kontra-Musik's activities via their website, <a href=\"http://www.kontra-musik.com/\">here</a>.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/57971767&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Reshaft is a collaborative project from Mizkami Ryuta (a.k.a Motoro Faam, mulllr) and Yui Onodera.Their debut record <em>Decon</em> (released last month on Comfortzone music), is a mesmeric bundle of brilliance that expands and contracts as it plays, creating new sonic forms within forms, and subtle, rhythmic patterns that cause tiny chain reactions in your ears. Ryuta and Onodera have made music that is, in a way, paradoxical - it fades into, but also enhances background noise. Their blend of organic and electronic sound is complex and craftily arranged, and presents the listener with unanticipated breaks and shifts in direction.</p>\n<p>Stray Landings talk to Onodera and Ryuta about rebellious crows, famous stone gardens in Japan and drifting from the path most travelled.</p>\n<p>**Why did you call the record **<strong><em>Decon</em>? And why the album cover of a crow perched on top of an air vent?</strong></p>\n<p>Onodera: The album title comes from essayist Jacques Derrida’s deconstruction. Reshaft is our platform to experiment with new methods – to go somewhere different from both of our previous work styles. So this album reflects many of our challenging ideas, and marks a departure from our usual ways of music production.</p>\n<p>The photograph is by a Japanese artist called Nozom Yoneda, and we chose this image among the few hundred photos in his collection. We thought that this isolated crow would perfectly represent our will to go against the present music scene. Nowadays, everything seems so average because people are aiming to be a generic icon that easily appeals to the crowds - so this solitary, black coloured crow can be seen as a symbol of rebellion. Also, in the ancient myths of Japan, crows appear as three-legged ravens, which indicate a good omen.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/170287403&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p>**Mizkami, do you remember when you first met Yui? **</p>\n<p>Mizkami: It was around 2006 when I met Yui for the first time - I sent a demo tape to his label. Last year, I met him again through a mutual friend, and Yui asked me if we could collaborate on a project. Then this project started!</p>\n<p><strong>And how did you go about the collaborative process?</strong></p>\n<p>Onodera: We both wanted to make this a platform to experience something different from both of our previous solo albums, so we tried various approaches for a diverse output in order to challenge this. We have done many collaborations with foreign artists before, but for Reshaft, we had the convenience of both living in Tokyo, so we were able to actually make music together in a live environment, rather than just sharing files across the web.</p>\n<p>It was an exciting experience for me and I was able to discover many things - not to mention this process was significantly different to our normal music-making methods, as we had to abandon our usual music production patterns. Ryuta and I wanted to push ourselves into a new place; we tried to stay away from our traditional walking paths.</p>\n<p>**Tell me about the process of making the record. Did you use field recordings or any strange instruments?　**</p>\n<p>Onodera: My main focus when making this record was to create beat-oriented music using field recordings. Not just constructing with electronic sounds but something more complex where the organic textures of the environmental sound moves around as rhythms. The majority of the sound that appears to be electronics is actually environmental sounds processed into complex layers. We are very satisfied with the outcome as this is something we haven’t approached in our solo works.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7576/16147349481_c0015eb1d2_z.jpg\" alt=\"TowerRecords SHINJUKU\"></p>\n<p><em>Decon display at Tower Records, Shinjuku Japan.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Do you think your approach on the record different much to how you would work as a solo artist?</strong></p>\n<p>Mizkami: For me, basically there is no difference. I simply want to enjoy composing music. At first Yui and I thought we would make one or two tracks as Reshaft to enjoy different ways of approaching music. However, we decided to continue the collaboration a little longer because we felt that our music was exciting, and the process went more smoothly than we thought.</p>\n<p>The first result is <em>Decon</em>. For Yui and for me Reshaft is very experimental, we have been enjoying producing the unexpected, and we expect something other than what we can produce as solo.</p>\n<p><strong>I read that you were a fan of the De Stijl movement in Art, about finding random artifacts and putting them together to make something new. Did you apply this method to <em>Decon</em>?</strong></p>\n<p>Onodera: Good question. Like you said, our approach is very close to the method of De Stijl where we build stories using limited materials. It’s not about the reality i.e. deconstructing objects and recomposing them by picking up the main elements - but transforming actual elements with obscurity into the non-systematical.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/175478845&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p>In Japan, we have a famous stone garden in the Ryōan-ji temple, and we call this style of beauty “Karesansui”. It’s a very Japanese feeling where people find beauty in something that seems without balance. It’s the same with me, I always feel the value of beauty within the unbalanced. I think it’s important to express what’s expanding beneath the surface, without being swept away by a particular emotion.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about the electronic music scene in Tokyo at the moment? I read the anti-dancing laws in the city have just been repealed – how much of an impact do you think this will have?</strong></p>\n<p>Mizkami: Indeed the number of nightclubs in Tokyo has diminished, but I suppose we definitely have more opportunities and places to go for music (including the Internet) than a decade ago.</p>\n<p>I live in Tokyo, though I listen to music without caring about the regions, or where and when the music belongs to. I guess everyone feels the same. Most of the Japanese think that this law is such a stupid idea - of course, as a musician, and as an individual, I feel the same. It is so absurd that I have nothing to say about it!</p>\n<p><strong>Finally what can we expect to hear next from Reshaft? Do you see the record as a one off project at the moment or are there plans for more material?</strong></p>\n<p>Mizkami: Reshaft is unpredictable and we don’t know where it will go… but we are working on an exciting project for the next step - please keep an eye out for what’s coming.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/179192014&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Inner Surface Music‘s offerings to 2014 revealed a penchant for abstract electronics previously not seen in the label. Alongside releasing a skeletal techno four-tracker from Yves De Mey under his new Grey Branches alias, ISM also shed light on Brooklyn based Angus Tarnawsky. Compiled from tracks written over a three year period, Tarnawsky’s ‘Pitched’ EP proved him as an artist with little regard for conventional production methods, creating heavily-processed rhythmic experiments, reminiscent of some of Autechre’s darker, more stripped-back moments.</p>\n<p>As Tarnawsky explained to us recently however, his process as a musician is a little more complex than that of your typical laptop producer. “I’ve been making music for as long as I can remember” he begins. “I studied improvisation at University and around 2006 I began to consistently apply effects such as delay and reverb to my acoustic drums in a more abstract capacity. After moving to NYC in 2010, many of my ideas began to be realised by purely electronic means, and much of this was linked to the modular synthesiser I began to assemble around that time. The concept of my current solo work is to merge the rhythmic sensibilities I have as a percussionist with the flexibility that studio tools can provide.”</p>\n<p>Tarnawsky’s experience as a drummer is still something inherent to his work however, and his background as a live musician has left collaboration very much at the core of his interests. Whilst speaking about his assorted projects, the extent of Tarnawsky’s involvement with different groups and artists becomes rather impressive to say the least. “I always have several projects on the go and inevitably they all work together to allow the right ideas to be presented at the right time - it gives you a good sense of using restraint. At the moment, I have two improv groups with the drummer Brian Chase where I process his acoustic playing in a live setting. One is a duo and the other is a quartet with electronics-guru Jaie Gonzalez and bassist Richard Hoffman. I also have an internet sound-art project called ‘Artifacts’ with the great pianist Nathan Liow who is based in Melbourne and additionally, have been playing with another amazing pianist, Richard Bennett here in Brooklyn. We work on very minimal pieces that are inspired by our involvement with composing works for the contemporary dance community.”</p>\n<p>Having been brought up in Melbourne Australia originally, Tarnawsky’s past five years have been spent in Brooklyn New York, a city which as he explains, has had quite a strong effect on his creative outlook. “NYC is an amazing place and I think anyone who has visited or lived here before knows what I’m talking about” he considers. “There’s a undeniable energy to the place. Australia also has a very dynamic culture and a great scene - Melbourne in particular - but you are rather isolated living there. For some that works fine but in my circumstance, I had the opportunity to move to NYC and join the band Apache Beat, who I played with for three years. Aside from the day-to-day inspiration of each city, a big impact of each location has to do with logistics. For example, my electronic focus began because I didn’t have a dedicated studio where I could play drums. Most people in Melbourne would go to a rehearsal studio but you’d have to take your gear and set it up every time then pack it down and take it home, load it up your stairs, etc. I would rehearse with my bands but couldn’t actually get any time to work on my electro-acoustic ideas in that environment. Melbourne is rather expensive and I couldn’t afford my own studio whilst living there. Arriving in NYC, I discovered that many people here rent dedicated spaces where they keep gear setup and so forth. Crazily, it’s actually cheaper than doing the same thing in Australia. I now have a studio in my basement that is soundproofed and I can play and record drums at anytime. This is reasonably common practice in the industrial parts of Brooklyn. Back in Australia, I really didn’t know anyone who had that luxury unless they lived somewhere further out of the city.”</p>\n<p>With an album of new material currently in the works, Tarnawsky’s mix for us follows a migration common with his own tracks; melding fifty minutes of tough, modular techno with increasingly abstract, ambient leaning soundscapes.</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Grey Branches // Exsolve [Inner Surface Music]</li>\n<li>AnD // Untitled B2 [Unknown]</li>\n<li>Angus Tarnawsky // Sensory [Unknown]</li>\n<li>Lee Gamble // Oneiric Contur [PAN]</li>\n<li>Pan Sonic // Hahmo [Mute Records]</li>\n<li>Austin Buckett // Sand Stems 1-7 (Thomas William Remix) [ROOM40]</li>\n<li>Shifted // Burning Tyres [Bed Of Nails]</li>\n<li>Vladislav Delay // Latoma [Echocord]</li>\n<li>Bill Youngman // Wespe [Killekill]</li>\n<li>Byetone // Grand Style [Raster Noton]</li>\n<li>Angus Tarnawsky // Dymaxion [Unknown]</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/stray-landings-mix-series/id556425050?mt=2\">Subscribe in iTunes</a></p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"60\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?feed=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0039-angus-tarnawsky%2F&amp;mini=1&amp;embed_uuid=c9835293-04bc-4f67-bbe2-59912328a8e1&amp;replace=0&amp;hide_cover=1&amp;hide_artwork=1&amp;embed_type=widget_standard&amp;hide_tracklist=1\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/0039-angus-tarnawsky/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=resource_link\">0039 // Angus Tarnawsky</a> by <a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=profile_link\">Stray Landings</a> on <a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=homepage_link\">Mixcloud</a></p>\n",

    "content": "<p>I think it’d be fair to say Berlin based Ian McDonnell aka Eomac made a fairly sizeable mark on the techno scene of 2014. Alongside releasing his sophomore album, <em>Spectre</em>, McDonnell saw both his first solo release with Luca Mortellaro’s Stroboscopic Artefacts and the signing of his Lakker project with Dara Smith to the legendary R&amp;S imprint. If releasing an EP via the Belgian label weren’t an achievement enough in itself, McDonnell &amp; Smith followed this up with a second EP, ‘Mountain Divide’, blending meticulously sculpted broken-beat rhythms with their signature glacial, Aphex Twin reminiscent synthplay.</p>\n<p>With these various feats in mind, we invited McDonnell to contribute to our ‘That Time When’ series, discussing five of his most memorable gigging experiences.</p>\n<p>##1 Dublin_2007##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7503/16026744469_09ce33b598_z.jpg\" alt=\"Whelans\"></p>\n<p>The Locust at Whelans was incredible for the sheer energy, madness, and yet tightness of the performance. Their songs are mostly less than a minute long - intense, complex blasts of rhythmic noise. And between songs they would just stand there silent and still. Then, out of nowhere, in unison, launch into the next blast of sound. I’ve never seen a band so together and so unhinged. Amazing.</p>\n<p>##2 Dublin_2007##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8622/15593000183_65edcbecb2_z.jpg\" alt=\"Locust\"></p>\n<p>I saw Pan Sonic at the Sugar Club about a week after The Locust gig - it was a good week for gigs in Dublin. The purity. Pure electronic music. Homemade synths, noise and sine waves. This was an all seated gig in a theatre-like venue in Dublin. In front of me people were squirming in their seats with their fingers in their ears. It was loud and it was physical. They were using frequencies that felt like something was trying to burrow into your ear. Ilpo Väisänen threw his synth off the table at the end and stormed off. Rock n’ roll. And very serious electronic music.</p>\n<p>##3 Minehead_2007##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8561/16026744579_0775e86801_z.jpg\" alt=\"Bloc\"></p>\n<p>It was my birthday, I was at Bloc with loads of mates, pissed on vodka, and dancing to my favourite musician DJing, Aphex Twin. It was one of those AFX sets where he starts with mellow, quirky electronica, Depeche Mode and hip-hop and finishes with Merzbow, via Current Value, Synthacon 5, classic rave anthems and the Grandstand theme tune. The kind of DJ set I love. It was the second night he played. The night before he had played a completely different set in the same room. Two masterclass DJ sets, two nights in a row.</p>\n<p>##4 Dublin_2006##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8674/16025528610_7a7740de67_z.jpg\" alt=\"NCH\"></p>\n<p>&quot;The point of course is to listen. There’s no final information to be conveyed… Listening to this music is like looking at a star-filled night sky, anything else is material for an astronomy lesson.&quot; - Christian Wolfe’s opening to his program notes for Morton Feldman’s second string quartet, which I saw performed by the Pelligrini Quartet at the NCH in Dublin.</p>\n<p>It is famous for being almost six hours long, with no breaks. It’s a mammoth undertaking for any string quartet to perform. But a very worthwhile one I’d imagine. To be a listener on such a musical journey is quite extraordinary - to be involved in making such a sound for that length of time must be something else.</p>\n<p>I’ve never done one of those long Berghain style DJ sets, but it must be similar - you get lost in the flow. Anyway, this piece is a beautiful, subtle and powerful piece of music. Quiet, repetitive and insistent, like a lot of Feldman’s music. It moves you to a different kind of listening, into a very dreamlike state, where a motif or a phrase might occur that triggers a memory of having heard it before, perhaps over three hours ago. It’s weird, and amazing. I’ve never had a feeling like the end of this piece, after nearly six hours of such quiet, delicate music. Nobody wanted to speak, or even breathe, in case they spoilt a really beautiful, silent moment. It was one of the most amazing musical experiences of my life, so far.</p>\n<p>##5 Dublin_1996##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7483/15593033533_788c7882c2_z.jpg\" alt=\"Point depot\"></p>\n<p>From lengthy string quartets to Keith Flint drooling onstage… I saw The Prodigy at Point Depot in 1996. When they played ‘Breathe’ I remember losing my shit - one of those moments when you are so lost in the music that all inhibitions go out the window and you are genuinely feeling quite alive. I remember thinking that this was the best night of my young life. The Prodigy had a run of gigs in the Point Depot, a venue on the docks in Dubin, between 1994 and 1997. This was my favourite one. They were my favourite band at the time, untouchable. This was just around the time they were going interstellar, after Firestarter, breaking America etc, and it is a very fond and formative memory for me.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Our latest podcast comes long overdue from James Rogers, aka <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/theweald\">The Weald</a>. Having not only contributed to the writing and research side of Stray Landings, Rogers has also appeared as a beacon of talent on our compilations and nights, and has thus been integral to the formation of the blog all along the way. His style has continually evaded full classification, with equal concern for dance floor fillers, abstract experimentation and sound collages. Even this mix itself is not the customary palette of sounds that one may expect from Rogers given his primary focus on techno, “I’ve been moving away from techno to more melodious climes” he explains, “this past year has been an amazing one for ambient music, and I’ve wanted to do a mix like this for a while. It was done inside the computer, and has some post-processing &amp; little bits of field recordings going on.” When pressed for a description of the mix, he responds in tongue-in-cheek self-mockery, “baked weightless ambience, floating in deepest water infinitely stretching out to the horizon.”</p>\n<p>Rogers has also recently founded the new Sheffield-based night, ‘<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ecoutezsheffield\">Ecoutez</a>’. “[It] started at a local pub”, he explains, as all good things do. “We got asked to do some music there for Tramlines (a festival in Sheffield) - then later we moved to Hagglers Corner, a local community arts space type thing, and Fred (Ras Si) started building the sound system. We like roots &amp; dub, jazz, rare groove, house &amp; anything funky and weird. we do it on Sunday evenings, it’s free, and although we are still taking baby steps, we are planning on making some bigger moves in 2015. Even though it’s on a Sunday people are really enthusiastic and don’t seem to mind braving the grim Northern weather to come and dance. This year I would really like to start an Ecoutez mix series, as Sheffield is full of great DJ’s.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, when asked who to watch out for in 2015, Sheffield seems to be at near boiling point in terms of its creative output; “I think Phoneutrian is quite underrated, I included a bit of one of his tunes in the mix, and he has a lot of good stuff on his Bandcamp. Harry Murdoch, who has also played at Ecoutez, is a great DJ and producer so hopefully we will hear some more stuff from him this year. Rhombohedral is another Sheffield head who has been bringing out some good stuff recently, the same with Lodger. No doubt Tarquin will continue his meteoric rise to grime stardom. As far as labels and nights go: CPU, Thrillhouse, Sheffield Techno Institute, Music People, Banana Hill, Funk n Kraftwerk, Paper Song Club and Offmenut for being true bassline warriors…”</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist</strong></p>\n<p>The Weald // Wolfloop 2 [Unreleased]<br>\nEduard Artemiev // Stalker Track 16 [Superior Viaduct US]<br>\nJack Jutson // Munari [Mood Hut]<br>\nHowlround // Torridan Gate [A Year in the Country]<br>\nPhoneutrian - Pressure / Seas [Unreleased]<br>\nLeyland Kirby // Stralauer Peninsula [History Always Favors The Winners]<br>\nBee Mask // Rain In Coffee [Spectrum Spools]<br>\nThe Weald // Spindelnat Edit [Unreleased]<br>\nTCF - E5 42 CC 3C 83 3D A0 76 DE 90 E4 CB 49 99 C9 9F C5 48 7A A8 2F 34 1F BC [Liberation Technologies]<br>\nPrinces of Dahomey // High Priest [PMF Records]<br>\nKyle Bobby Dunn // Spem In Alium &amp; Her Unable [Students of Decay]<br>\nKoji Kondo // Ocarina of Time Forest Temple (+ reverb) [Pony Canyon]</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/stray-landings-mix-series/id556425050?mt=2\">Subscribe in iTunes</a></p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?feed=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0040-the-weald%2F&embed_uuid=3087eab8-bc0c-4f04-986f-4c5f7049891a&replace=0&hide_cover=1&embed_type=widget_standard&hide_tracklist=1\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/0040-the-weald/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=resource_link\">0040 // The Weald</a> by <a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=profile_link\">Stray Landings</a> on <a href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=homepage_link\"> Mixcloud</a></p>\n",

Aside from the fact they weren’t even released by the 25th (if that’s not subversive I don’t know what is), their lack of any discernible melody or rhythm probably would’ve got in the way anyway. As with much of the rest of the Cutting Room Records release LP, the two offerings can loosely be termed as drone, complete with the usual traits (claustrophobia, paranoia etc). In short it sounds like your kitchen radio has been possessed by a poltergeist and it’s fucking glorious.</p>\n<p>The gloomy ambience which dominates the record has much in common with the kind of dense, fog-laden atmospheres you might expect to open a Raime or Demdike Stare track - the difference here is that these sounds don’t let up for a single moment. ‘-ment’ for example shudders across five minutes, grating synths drilling away everything in their path. At times the track feels as if it may be about to transition out of Dialta’s oppressive soundscapes, before another nauseating wave of plummeting drones signals the start of another round of the cycle.</p>\n<p>Penultimate track ‘Gloam’ is about as close to conventionality as the LP gets, which is saying something as it could hardly be considered accessible.  Stumbling kicks lurch drunkenly to and fro, pinning down waves of static constantly threatening to career out of control.</p>\n<p>There is something Kafka-esque about the general listening experience - travelling through Dialta’s labyrinth of warbling distortion and groaning soundscapes, it’s easy to feel disorientated. Transitioning from ‘Birthday’ into ‘Slow Hole’ the difference is almost inaudible - Dialta making his progression across the album at a tortuous pace which is all the more fitting of its aforementioned Kafka-link. Brighton based CRR has cropped up on my radar several times over the last twelve months, and Nolan Dialta’s LP inaugurates 2015 for the label in fine style.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/69803877&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Since the rise of dubstep into international megastardom, many of us have felt robbed by the assimilation of the genre into American mainstream culture. During the late 2010s, it became difficult for producers to reinvent themselves against the predominant festival headliners and sell-out venues, and adopt an alternative experimental style that still remained indigineous to dubstep heritage. As a result, UK dubstep nights appeared to lull and insist instead on house and techno sets, leaving the genre in something of a purgatory state. But there are some keeping the dream alive, as Senking’s latest instalment of our podcast series can attest; “I sure would like to see more of this kind of music being release these days” he explains, “I remember seeing Skream and Loefah years ago in Cologne. This was a great night of dancing for me, it felt like being 16 again [laughs].”</p>\n<p>Since then, Senking has blended the tighter, more mechanical approach of dub techno with the murky dubstep of the 00s. “Of course, in this mix there is plenty of dubstep and I think it´s no secret that I´m into this kind of stuff - it had an influence on my late work. But I´m not that interested in making dubstep now.” So why this turn to dubstep in the mix? “The thinking behind the mix in general was more about the “bastard rock” idea: several tracks running at the same time. I´m enjoying this a lot at the moment as it is not so much about making music, but more about administrating music… This way, I can be just a fanboy by putting this stuff together; it´s so great to play around with different tracks and being surprised when they fit together in a way I like. In the end, for me, this mix is about the joy of music making.”</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist:  </strong></p>\n<p>Killawatt &amp; Thelem // Swarf [New Moon Recordings]<br>\nKaiju // M16 [Osiris Music]<br>\nProxima // Grunge [Tempa]<br>\nBenton // Whormholes [Wheel &amp; Deal Records]<br>\nProxima // Lie Detection [Tempa]<br>\nProxima // Thermal Vision [Tempa]<br>\nReso // Smash Yer Face In [Civil Music]<br>\nSPMC &amp; LX One // Hunted [Tempa]<br>\nTwo Fingers // Vengeance Rhythm [Big Dada Recordings]<br>\nRhythm &amp; Sound // King and Queen in my Empire “duet” [Burial Mix]<br>\nSeba // Special Ops [Combination Recordings]<br>\nTricky // Mad Frankie Fraser [Palm Pictures]<br>\nRatking feat.

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> Self-released\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 26/01/2015</p>\n<p>They say scientists know more about space than they do about the deep recesses of the ocean. If it’s weird shit they’re after however, I wonder if they’ve spent enough time YouTube surfing, as someone who occasionally stumbles on it’s abstract corners. One such corner holding my attention over the last twelve months has been a YouTube channel titled ‘Chookiesss’, exposing all manner of weird and wonderful experiments in electronic music to the wider public. Recently, I discovered it’s founder has self-released his own EP entitled ‘Closed Mouths’, and much like the channel he curates, it is both a diverse and challenging affair.</p>\n<p>Perhaps what is most instantly disorientating is the fact it’s structure follows no conventional thread, meandering instead between disparate textures, all the way from the meditative groans of ‘Blossom’ to ’Cel’ - which seems to have been composed largely with the aid of a jackhammer. Throughout the EP, the tracks strain against themselves, lacing these vast sheets of ambience with fibres of high-pitched noise.</p>\n<p>Take, the opening ‘Dawn’ for example - with its mournful, haunting vocal loops gathering in intensity across a mesmerising four minutes - a long way from the eardrum shattering noise of ‘Cel’. Furthermore, ‘Flagella’ and ‘Velvet’, call to mind the work of Tim Hecker or Fennesz; droning walls of fuzzed out chords occasionally soar in intensity before crashing down wave-like back into Chookiesss subdued ambience.</p>\n<p>'Closed Mouths' doesn't ring of anything conventional in its composition, instead aiming to surprise and provoke the listener with its contrasts at every turn. In this sense the release feels somewhat fractured, as if showing fragments of something much larger - let's hope Chookiesss  has more pieces of the puzzle ready for us sooner rather than later.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/71814412&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>When the topic of 90’s Hardcore arises, one image always instantly springs to mind: a pair of wild-eyed young ravers clad in chemical suits and dust masks - an outfit that can now be considered synonymous with reese basslines, jangling house pianos and double-time breakbeats (or DIY I suppose). Beneath the masks the pair are Mark Archer and Chris Peat - a duo who shot rave music into the charts with a slew of pun-titled tracks like ‘Activ-8’, ‘E-vapor-8’ or ‘Brutal-8-E’.</p>\n<p>Over twenty years on and despite having parted ways with Chris Peat, Archer in still flying the Hardcore flag, gigging across the UK and beyond. With one of these performances being held in March at this year’s Bloc Festival, we thought it’d be fitting to invite Archer to contribute to our ‘That Time When’ series, revisiting five of his standout rave memories.</p>\n<p>##1 Stoke On Trent_1991##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7286/16184598900_219ac5fe00_o.jpg\" alt=\"shelleys1\"></p>\n<p>As much as it is documented that we ‘just turned up’ in a lorry and started playing at Shelley’s Car Park in Longton, there was a lot more thought behind it - well, at least a little bit. Shelley’s was a club that I went to most weekends if we weren’t doing a P.A anywhere, the promoter of the night was Amnesia house from Coventry who also did nights at the eclipse.</p>\n<p>I’d noticed that once the night was over, most of the ravers would stand around in the car park, doors open on their cars with rave tapes blaring out. We had played at Shelley’s a few times already as Altern8 and as Nexus 21 and had promo’d Activ-8 off a dub plate there to see if the track worked, so we thought that doing a free P.A. in the car park would get some great footage for the video, as well as giving the ravers something to dance to.</p>\n<p>3am, as everyone was coming out of the club, we pulled back the side of the lorry curtain and started playing to the crowd that had gathered in front. We had let word slip that something might happen so there were more people outside the club than usual and people had travelled from as far as Wales and Scotland! People were dancing on top of cars and the car park was literally rammed with people all going mad, not something I’m going to forget in a hurry.</p>\n<p>##2 Coventry_1991##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8615/16346010246_8cc4840a05_z.jpg\" alt=\"eclipse\"></p>\n<p>The first ever Altern 8 P.A. - Eclipse, was pretty chaotic as gigs go. There was a bit of a stage invasion at the end by crowd members who were completely spangled, and didn’t even realise there was a P.A. going on, but this was the gig that brought about the Altern 8 image (we had played at the eclipse a few month previous as Nexus 21 and wanted to look different).</p>\n<p>With Infiltrate 202 doing the rounds on promo, the reaction was brilliant and we had the whole video for Infiltrate recorded that night, complete with a girl dancing between us not even aware we were playing live. Even bumped into the Homeboy from A Homeboy a Hippy and a funky dred on the way out - top night.</p>\n<p>##3 Bloc_2009##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7446/16371986135_f38212dfd0_z.jpg\" alt=\"bloc\"></p>\n<p>Very daunting this one was, I was playing a DJ set following Skream &amp; Benga and they tore the place a new one, with Skream totally mullered and stopping every tune he dropped within a minute. The crowd was going absolutely mental and to follow this had me wondering if the oldskool was going to cut it (I’d also had my slot moved forward so anyone planning to head to the room for the advertised time would miss it), but by a few tunes into the set I’d got no cause for worry. Hands were going up for every tune, crowd knew the words to all the vocal tracks and the total sing along to Prodigy’s ‘out of space’ at the end just blew me away, so buzzed up I left my headphones by the decks (a small price to pay for such as great memory).</p>\n<p>##4 Birmingham_1991##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8625/15751993543_38846d981b_z.jpg\" alt=\"birmingham\"></p>\n<p>City Of Music celebration, Centenary Square, N.Y.E. Having a gig booked by Birmingham City Council didn’t really fill me full of confidence with this one, but we had a gig later on that night at Wigan Pier so knew we’d at least have one good gig to bring in the new year. I got a call from my dad a few hours before we set off to say that something was on the local news about Centenary square in Birmingham - where we were playing there was already reported to be around 40,000 people there…</p>\n<p>There were around 2000 die hard ravers right at the front who’d been waiting for us to come on, but seeing that many people in front of the stage was mental! ‘Activ-8’ was still in the charts and had got to number three so a good percentage of the crowd knew it and when our stilt walking robot came on to the stage the noise was unbelievable. Wigan Pier obviously paled in comparison.</p>\n<p>##5 New York_1991##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7402/16371986035_bcfa90259d_z.jpg\" alt=\"limelight\"></p>\n<p>There was some kind of industry schmooze-fest going on in a downstairs part of ‘Limelight’ on the night of this gig, so there were people like Shep Pettibone and Cathy Dennis in the crowd. DJ’s on the night were Joey Beltram and Lenny Dee so I was a tad star struck (still get like it much to the annoyance of my girlfriend).</p>\n<p>Playing out in New York was totally different to the UK gigs we were used to doing and it had an almost punk vibe to it with people moshing at the front of the stage. Joey Beltram managed to play ‘Move My Body’ as his last tune, just before we came on and it was the first track in our live set (ouch) but the atmosphere in there was like nowhere else and the track still went off. One of our dancers discovered special K that night and despite me shouting to him we were leaving, he stayed at the venue, sat on a chair in the middle of the stage like Jim Royale.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>My first exposure to Ben Sims was being shown a clip of him mixing alongside Cristian Varella, managing six turntables between them - this should give at least some barometer of Sims’ skills as a DJ, which are nothing short of masterful. Over the years however, the London based producer has had many ventures besides his pursuits as a world renowned DJ, running nights, labels, radio stations and producing techno records as surgically precise as his mixing skills.</p>\n<p>With a performance scheduled for this years Bloc festival, we decided to catch up with Sims, discussing the festival, his relationship with Kirk Degiorgio** **and the future fate of London nightlife.</p>\n<p><strong>You managed to remain as prolific as ever last year despite having a large amount of gear stolen from your studio in Hackney, how did you manage to remain motivated after such an incident?</strong></p>\n<p>I’d only been at the new studio two months when that happened and it wasn’t quite finished before the break in, but it did make an arse of my plans for plenty of new production work last year.</p>\n<p>Luckily I’d predicted that it may take anything up to six months to get the sound right in the new place. I’d really got my head down in the old studio before I left and had a batch of tracks put aside for new projects, so release wise it didn’t hold me up too much but obviously it was a nightmare and it took months to get the insurance money to start over. My first proper session wasn’t until September 10th, months after I moved in.</p>\n<p><strong>Was their any development in trying to catch those responsible? I remember seeing a lot of people share the CCTV footage via social networks…</strong></p>\n<p>Nope. Admittedly we didn’t expect the equipment back but we at least wanted to make it more difficult to sell and make people more aware of it. In general the police were fucking useless to be honest, they took it seriously when the statement was first made public and helped in getting lots of retweets and shares etc. but quickly lost interest, far more worried about saving face than actually doing their job.</p>\n<p>We even gave them the footage and exact times they needed to pull CCTV from other cameras but they didn’t do anything, I don’t think they have the staff or time to actually investigate so called ‘victimless’ crimes, they’re obviously too busy filming TV shows about arresting drunks!</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about your decision to close <em>Theory</em> last year as well? Will this be the end of your work as label host or just a transition into something new?</strong></p>\n<p>As happy as I am with the label’s output recently I just think its run its course, I’ve gone full circle from it being a remix project to a solo to a label for releasing music by others, all the way back again. It just feels right to finish at a point I’m proud of and start something fresh.</p>\n<p>I’m not going to immediately launch a new label to take its place, initially I just want to focus on making new music, finish off some of the other projects that were overshadowed by Theory and take it from there.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/44859648&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>You’re performing at Bloc this year… How was the experience last time you played there? Who are you most looking forward to seeing on the lineup this time round?</strong></p>\n<p>Obviously there’s loads of great names on the line up and plenty of my current faves and all time heroes but I’m most looking forward to checking out Ron Morelli, as although I’m definitely a fan of the label, I’ve never really seen him (or any of the regular L.I.E.S. acts) spin, plus Traxx will be on my hit list as I only got a chance to see him once before and he was awesome… I’ve gotta check out ESG, I only saw them a couple of times many moons ago and they were amazing, so tight, so really looking forward to that.</p>\n<p>I had a lot of fun the couple of times I played Bloc at Minehead before, I used to go to soul weekends quite a bit at holiday camps like Butlins in my yout’ and was hugely influenced by that whole scene, so it’s great to be spinning at an electronic event like Bloc at the same kinda venue, feels like a rite of passage in a way.</p>\n<p>I did also play the ill fated London one but just on the ship for Boiler Room. It was really cool and obviously I didn’t know anything about the forthcoming drama when I was on, it was only after that things started to get crazy with security and police clumsily shutting it down. I’m very glad they’re back to their spiritual home again.</p>\n<p><strong>Have you always lived in London? The last couple of years have seen quite a large threat to the city’s nightlife – Fabric recently coming under fire, alongside the closure of Plastic People, and Cable in 2013. How do you feel about this and do you think we’ll see more change to the London clubbing scene over this year?</strong></p>\n<p>I grew up on the Essex borders and moved to a London postcode in my early 20s but I’ve been partying and DJing around the London circuit since the late 80s, so I’ve seen many clubs come and go.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8583/16205476837_10838bde92_z.jpg\" alt=\"ben-sims-nowa-jerozolima-658\"></p>\n<p>To be honest it’s kind of inevitable, most are in industrial or barren areas when they open, so they don’t really bother anyone but when leases or licenses need renewing, the whole area might have changed, become fashionable or gentrified and a loud club, with hundreds of people on the streets around it every weekend isn’t appropriate anymore.</p>\n<p>Obviously it’s a shame when legendary clubs close or are getting serious hassle from the authorities but its also a bit naive to think they’ll last forever to be honest, best to celebrate them while they’re there and make the most of them.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of the local scene you joined NTS radio last year, have you been enjoying having a regular slot on the station? Any special plans for the show across the rest of this year?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah it’s great to be back doing a regular show, especially on a local station. NTS has an almost pirate radio feel about it, with many of the DJs coming from the Dalston/Hackney area and I really like that, plus it’s very open musically and not known for one sound or one genre specifically and that’s really important.</p>\n<p>I actually just revamped and relaunched the show, the first one of 2015 went out two days ago and is now called ‘run it red’ (named after my tendency to distort channels on mixers), plus I’ve given it some structure, some different sections and tried to make it a bit more professional sounding with jingles, vocal drops and music beds etc, rather than just me mixing a bunch of new tunes for three hours and annoying people by talking over them!</p>\n<p>The focus is still very mush on pushing new techno, house and electronica (I only play music I’ve bought, been sent or has been released in the month prior) and whenever possible, to push new artists and labels.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/36073893&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p>It's not a DJ set or podcast as such, it's meant to be more informative than that, like the kinda radio shows I used to listen to obsessively (Jazzy M, Colin Dale, Tim Westwood, Mike Allen, Coldcuts, Solid Steel etc). It's meant to showcase the music, not me.</p>\n<p><strong>And how about your Machine parties with Kirk Degiorgio? How did the two of you first meet and when did you decide to start running nights together?</strong></p>\n<p>We had many friends in common for a long time without properly meeting each other - that didn't happen til the mid 2000s when I booked him to play a Split party at The Key in Kings Cross (R.I.P.), a few years later after Split was through we got talking about putting a night on together.</p>\n<p>The concept of solely focusing on new music was all Kirk, he also found someone to help us run/fund it (Josh Doherty). That was four years ago and now with my manager (Dean) helping us things are the best they've ever been in London with regular nights at Corsica and Fabric plus we're working on occasional one offs for later in the year and regularly taking the night to different countries all over the world ( last weekend Spain, this weekend Thailand and Singapore).</p>\n<p>Add a label and a forthcoming mix CD by Kirk to the mix and it's all going very well indeed!</p>\n<p><strong>Finally what's next for yourself? Any new projects in the works over 2015?</strong></p>\n<p>This year I'm aiming to do more in the studio and try to get some long discussed, never materialised ideas off the ground (like a hip hop project, and hardware only electro jams) plus some techno collaborations too.</p>\n<p>I'll be resurrecting at least one of my labels that was taken down prematurely by distributor collapse (Symbolism) and also trying to do a few more 'all night' sets in open minded clubs - just before Christmas I did one at Twisted Pepper in Dublin and really enjoyed it, kind of like warming up and setting the mood for yourself, its a great challenge as you have no one but yourself to blame if the flow of the music over the evening is shit, so there's far more responsibility than just a DJ set, and after many years of happily staying in my comfort zone, I'm ready to experiment a lot more and take some risks!</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/182120566&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>I must admit that I first became aware of Randomer’s output quite late in the game, when Hessle Audio’s ’116 &amp; Rising’ compilation showcased the now classic ‘Brunk’. Since then, Randomer’s productions have always stood out to me as somehow distinct from most, continually reshifting the parameters of experimentation, always keeping one step ahead of the rest. His tracks are dizzying in their complexity; marrying intricate polyrhythmic webs and percussion that hits harder than nails. The result is an intoxicating one, and it’s this ability to combine textural complexity with dynamic brawn that has allowed Randomer’s productions to steadily permeate UK dance music for the last seven years. Last week we had the opportunity to catch up with the man behind the music ahead of his Bloc performance in March to discuss Plastic People, Jungle and the death of the album.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/15619373&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>So how are things with you at the moment? What was 2014 like for you in reflection?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m great thanks. Enjoying having a more relaxed January after a hectic few months! 2014 was a mad year. Easily the best I’ve had so far, and I’m just grateful and happy to have got this far.</p>\n<p><strong>You’re playing at the exciting revival of Bloc festival this year - were you there at the 2012 event? Who are you looking forward to seeing on the bill this time round?</strong></p>\n<p>I was not at the 2012 Bloc, however I was out that night in London and the atmosphere everywhere was crazy with all the people that had been at the festival making their own last minute parties and creating havoc. Turned out to be a great night.</p>\n<p>I’m losing my shit about the jungle line up on Sunday this time around. Dillinja is my hero as far as electronic music goes, so to see him along with Source Direct and Randall and Doc Scott playing old school sets… I’m gonna go nuts!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4293/35894408162_1facc469db_z.jpg\" alt=\"ase\"></p>\n<p><strong>I read that your influences can be traced back to pirate radio and jungle - do you think D’n’B is due for revival? Is there any recent D’n’B that you have been enjoying recently?</strong></p>\n<p>Maybe DNB is less ‘trendy’ than it used to be in mainstream electronic music. The scene is still alive and I made some of my best friends in music through drum’n’bass. It informed so much music that came after it in the UK, that even if people stop making music at 170 bpm, it lives on in that. Guys like Alix Perez, Sam Binga and Fracture have been making some really cool stuff that crosses over with what’s happening in hip-hop at the moment. Also I find time to connect with the ridiculous and twisted world of Mefjus, Icicle, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>You joined the acclaimed L.I.E.S imprint last year with ‘Residents’ - how did that come about? Are there plans for more involvement with those guys in the future?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes working with L.I.E.S has been a pleasure from the beginning. I spent the first part of the year thinking about what I was going to do with a number of tracks that I had made the year before and decided on a whim to send them to Ron Morelli. I had no idea if he was going to like them or not, but he emailed me back and said he wanted to put them all out. We’re looking to work together more in the future for sure!</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/158081729&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Up and down the country we have seen the closure of some great clubs recently - most notably perhaps Plastic People. What do you see as the impetus for this? Will it last? What’s your history with Plastic People?</strong></p>\n<p>There’s a lot of clubs closing yes. It’s a big shame. A lot of it is officially due to noise restrictions and safety, but I have a feeling that there’s a lot of expensive property in central London that the powers that be would rather see invested in by big property developers. It could force clubs in London to start relocating to the outskirts, and this might be a cool thing. I used to go to a lot of free parties in London, and one of the best things about them was the location in industrial parts of London…</p>\n<p>Plastic People was a big shame. It meant a lot to me, I used to go down to FWD all the time from about 2007. Friends put some great parties on there also (shouts to Medium and Neighbourhood). And I played my first ever gig in the venue. It feels like a line has been drawn over those times.</p>\n<p><strong>How’s your white label series doing? Are there any plans for more releases on this imprint? What was your initial thinking behind doing this?</strong></p>\n<p>The white label I put out as an experiment to see what it was like to put out a record. I wanted to know more about the ins and outs of it, it helps your relationships with other labels to know what they have to deal with. I had the tracks lying about and didn’t want them to get lost in time so I chucked them on.</p>\n<p>Perhaps I’ll do another some time, but there are no concrete plans.</p>\n<p><strong>You once stated that “the album format is dead”. Could you tell us a little more about why you think that is?</strong></p>\n<p>That was quite an outlandish statement looking back on it. I think I was talking about how hard it is to make an album of <em>songs</em> in electronic music. I do really enjoy the immersive experience that a purely listening electronic album like Untold’s last year can provide.</p>\n<p>**Finally, what can we expect to hear from you this year? Are there any exciting projects you can tell us about? **</p>\n<p>I’m going to be working hard on my craft. I’m always up for taking chances with my ideas and they don’t stop coming. And the best place to hear my new music is when I’m performing. So I hope I get a chance to come everywhere that people want to hear me this year!</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/112398812&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> arjunamusic\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> 12”/CD/Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 09/02/2015</p>\n<p>Future jazz has never been articulated so clearly.</p>\n<p>'ambiq' are electronic pioneer Max Loderbauer, clarinetist Claudio Putin and percussionist Samuel Rohrer. While each has a prolific musical career in their own right, brought together, they pool their individual talents to form something refreshingly original.</p>\n<p>In today’s musical landscape where collaborations are frequent and genre splicing is the norm originality like <em>ambiq</em>’s is hard to come by. Perhaps that’s why they find themselves on <em>arjunamusic</em> – a Berlin-based label run by Rohrer with a penchant for timeless, classic, and independent acoustic and electronic music.</p>\n<p>Comprised of eleven songs, ambiq’s eponymously titled album is a genuine attempt to find a new musical realm; following in the tradition of modern composers like Steve Reich, the form of each composition is hard to label. Time signatures are unidentifiable, the melodies difficult to predict, and the sonic textures many – despite only three musicians present on the recording. The music demands everything from you, and from ‘Erdkern’, song one, to ‘Tarantula’, song eleven, you won’t be able to dedicate ambiq anything less than your full attention.</p>\n<p>One of the core tenants of arjunamusic is the focus on both acoustic and electronic instrumentation and production. It would seem that this is a primary concern in ambiq, where Putin’s clarinet and Rohrer’s percussion are subjected to electronic manipulation.</p>\n<p>The classic percussive sounds of chimes and bells are turned queer through Loderbauer’s electronic interference. Delay and reverb are purposefully used sparingly to give clarinet a flavour of the alien, and inorganic, analogue synth melodies and drum patterns are woven seamlessly into the music’s fabric to deliver a record that defies classification.</p>\n<p>Perhaps my initial labelling of ambiq as “future jazz” was reductive, then.</p>\n<p>However, given that listening to this music made me think of Jonny Greenwood and the London Contemporary Orchestra, as well as Berlin-based Brandt Brauer Frick, it’s clear that ambiq – though creative, ambitious and original – is not truly unique.</p>\n<p>This is not a slight on the trio’s work, however, as the album stands as a master class in how to approach the seemingly impossible brief of making something new and unheard of. It’s brave, contemporary, and inventive, and it should be given the upmost respect if you decide to give it your attention.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/120333908&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

Pushing even further forward into realms of unearthly abstract experimentation, it feels as though Kerridge is trying to reimagine the mysterious mood of a half-remembered dream, or warn us with a dystopian depiction of the future. The opening groan of the introductory track ‘GOFD’, for instance, sounds lifted straight from a horror movie, and marks the beginning of an increasingly morbid montage. Or take ‘DAYT’, with its burly, menacing horns that waver like the war cry of a elephant, and the epic ‘WOSN’ that weaves together boundless strings into a rich mesh of shimmering resonances.</p>\n<p>Yet, despite this otherworldly territory of Kerridge’s music, to think of it as unstuck from time and place altogether would be a mistake. It has an an undeniable ‘spatial’ quality at its core, and it’s important not to divorce his sound from its live context entirely. Speaking to FACT last week, Kerridge explains, “I really feel this LP catches a particular moment. I wanted to keep a bit more space between things, to let it breathe”. Indeed, having recently co-founded the new Contort imprint that the album is signed to, it’s near impossible to decouple Kerridge’s output from the wide open spaces of Berlin’s abandoned power stations that house the new Contort parties, including their residency at Berlin Atonal festival.</p>\n<p>The spirit of Berlin’s factory spaces can also be found in the track names themselves. The tracklist delivers a series of mysterious acronyms: ’TRN5’, ‘NCV’, ‘WIAGW’… Each individual track is a distinct part or product, developed and packaged as if a unit on a factory conveyor belt. Even the album cover itself looks like a modular key or hard disk used to store these unique codes. But that’s not to say that this LP is formulaic. Far from it, the record serves as something of a leap forward in sonic experimentation. Where his 2013 effort <em>Fallen Empire</em> raised a lot of questions around the current state of industrial and dark ambient, <em>Always Offended…</em> seeks to distill those ideas into purer, more articulate forms.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/78572221&color=8f8f8f&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> Self-released\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 09/02/2015</p>\n<p>Whilst reviewing Reshaft’s glitch-laced ambient LP <em>Decon</em> late last year, I remember Yu Miyashita (Yaporigami) mentioning his friendship with duo member Yui Onodera. It is presumably this association that has led to their most recent project - a pair of remixes, with Miyashita contributing his take on a cut from <em>Decon</em>, and Reshaft following suit with a reinterpretation of ‘Been’ from Miyashita’s <em>Drudged Torn Routine</em>.</p>\n<p>The two offerings manage to both reveal crossovers between the two acts, as well as highlighting points where they deviate from one another. Miyashita’s cast of ‘Comfort Zone 3’ shakes free of the original’s hazy, out of focus feel, creating a lumbering, mechanical slab of techno. There is something reminiscent of early Klaus releases, or Rene Pawolitz’s take on dubstep as The Panamax Project in Miyashita’s wearied half-step rhythms.</p>\n<p>Reshaft on the other hand stretch the boundaries of Miyashita’s drum-work to their limits - kick drums staggering between billowing synthesisers &amp; abstract percussion. The effect is jarring to say the least, the tonal palette significantly more ambiguous than Miyashita’s menacingly affront original.</p>\n<p>The way in which both acts’ sounds have been aligned here gives an unfamiliar, explorative mood to the tracks - keeping a sense of anticipation all the way through. Furthermore, if this is the calibre to be expected of tracks Miyashita &amp; Reshaft are comfortable to dispatch as a casual free download, their more considered projects throughout 2015 should definitely be something to look out for.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/79687713&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> <a href=\"http://swedishelectronicliberationfront.se/\">S.E.L.F.</a>\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> 12”\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 16/02/2015</p>\n<p>Andreas Tilliander made his name releasing dubbed out electronica and glacial hardware techno for imprints such as Mille Plateaux, Raster Noton and Kontra Musik. Along the way he also made about a dozen other names; adopting more alias’ than you can shake a Scandinavian stick at - Lowfour, TM404, Komp, Svaag and Rechord are just a few of his assorted pseudonyms. His latest record comes from under the ‘Mokira’ moniker - a name which has tagged some of Tilliander’s oldest, most influential productions.</p>\n<p>This said, I may have been a little hasty in defining the so titled ‘Skaka Hund Skaka’ as a record - host entity S.E.L.F. or ‘The Swedish Electronic Liberation Front’ beg to disagree. “Just like Magritte’s pipe wasn’t a pipe, this is not a record” declares their press statement accompanying the release. Personally I reckon it probably is a record, but without getting too caught up in another Cartesian episode, the release whatever it is, is rather captivating.</p>\n<p>The fact each track title is a variation on the release title ‘Skaka Hund Skaka’ is fitting considering they all feel cut from the same mould. The same web of static, rolling drum machines and echoing clicks and taps are common to each. Skaka Hund Skaka’ &amp; ‘Skaka Skaka Hund’ for example are barely distinguishable from one another, it is only (as the onomatopoeic title might suggest) the order of clicking percussion and swelling bass rumbles which separates them.</p>\n<p>There is a slight deviation to this formula in intermediary track ‘Hund Skaka Hund’, which is reminiscent of the 3am warehouse jams you might find on a label like Electric Deluxe, albeit on a heavy dose of sleeping pills. The track crawls forward drowsily, its bassline plodding forward as if trekking across the desert for days on end, weary and disorientated.</p>\n<p>With the Mokira alias having been out of service for the last four years, ‘Skaka Hund Skaka’ puts the project back on the map in fine style. Minimal, dubbed-out techno with lots of static may sound like a simple formula, but when under the guidance of an artist as well versed as Tilliander, it can turn out to be something quite special indeed.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/180089157&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> Repitch Recordings\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> 12”/Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 25/02/2015</p>\n<p>Jonathan Krohn has achieved rather a lot over the last two years. He debuted as part of the duo Talker (along with Karl Meier), releasing both an album and EP of industrial, noise ridden techno.  Solo, his sonic standpoints are similar. Under the name ‘Stave’ he has put out two further works , both with comparably brooding aesthetics. Following suit is his most recent release, ‘After The Social’ which feels as if it’s been composed with little more than a bass guitar and an oil drum. It has a gritten, sandpaper like quality to it - like two bricks disintegrating as they are scraped against one another.</p>\n<p>Despite it’s rugged texture, ‘After The Social’ maintains an amphetamine charged level of energy. ‘Hardened Chord’ for example thunders forward from it’s first second - like a greyhound loosed from the stalls. Like much of Stave’s EP, the track is essentially loop-driven, which seems an odd approach for a set of tracks so richly textured. The technique is usually reserved for more overtly functional techno, yet here it adds nicely to Krohn’s droning soundscapes.</p>\n<p>The tracks smoulder intently - like Sunn O))) with a pulse. They crackle wildly as they are repeatedly barraged by fuzz and distortion. ‘Circle Pit’ lets out tortured screams above an abyss of bone-shattering sub, rumbling forcefully and incessantly. ‘Paid Jazz’ offers at least a degree more dynamic. Its intro gives the listener a few seconds to gather breath before thundering back to a cacophony of rattling bass and thudding snares.</p>\n<p>Karl O’Connor alleviates nothing by way of intensity across his spartan take on ‘Hardened Chord’ - brazen 4/4 kicks hammering beneath rumbling percussive flourishes. He does take pains to construct some shifts in dynamic and intensity and intensity however. The track develops with slow menace - in line with the Sandwell District signature sound which has made his previous productions so influential.</p>\n<p>'After The Social' is full-throttle, and on the surface makes little concession for subtlety. After a few listens it becomes clear where the EP's real beauty lies however. Despite the lack of breaks or intro sections to the tracks, Krohn's detailed nuances give the release a wild, untamed feel, which is hard not to be affected by.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/80423015&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Last week we caught up with Michael Hann, the man behind the mysterious Marreck moniker and head honcho of the nascent <a href=\"http://rejectandfade.tumblr.com\">Reject and Fade</a> imprint. This article comes in the light of his latest LP <em>Ceteology</em>, which was recently released on the criminally overlooked Irish label <a href=\"http://www.trensmat.com\">Trensmat Records.</a> Hann should feel right at home at Trensmat - a label that has held tight to the pillars of experimental music: brave, daring and radical, both Trensmat and Hann’s Ceteology LP capture the essence of noise music and culture in its purist form.</p>\n<p>We first became aware of Reject and Fade through the brilliant rkss release <em>Tunnel</em> - out on cassette last year. “Robin is cool as cucumber and deserves a shout out every time!” states Hann. “In the mix I have also dropped in a few demos, as I thought it would be cool to drop in stuff people haven’t heard and who are or are likely to be releasing stuff soon on Reject and Fade. I am being a little non committal as I am not planning on releasing a lot via RnF (maybe only two to three releases a year), so a lot can change between now and whenever. Ideally I would like each release to have a sense of occasion about it and leave people anticipating and hungry for what is coming next.”</p>\n<p>Reflecting on the release of <em>Ceteology</em>, Hann has compiled a mix of the influences surrounding the record, ”I kind of put a constraint on myself that I could only use music which I had been listening to when I was making the record but also I didn’t want to chuck in some of the obvious references such as Drexciya” he explains. “I decided I would only use music which I took away with me when I went off to work offshore. What you have here is what I was listening to when I was in between work, thinking about home/trying not to think about home, flying backwards and forwards and: voila…”</p>\n<p>Tracklist:</p>\n<p>Raime // Your Cast Will Tire [Blackest Ever Black]<br>\nrkss // Rain [Unreleased]<br>\nJo Johnson // In the Shadow of the Workhouse [Further Records]<br>\nGranite Portal // Scavenger Hunt [Unreleased]<br>\nSwans // Toussaint Overture [Young God Records]<br>\nShifted // Burning Tyres [Bed of Nails]<br>\nBlood Room - Quell [Unreleased]<br>\nWizard Of // MirrorExit [Unreleased]<br>\nMarreck // Octavo [Trensmat]<br>\nNick Cave and the Bad Seeds // Push the Sky Away [Bad Seed Ltd]</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?embed_type=widget_standard&embed_uuid=bb7e7f07-973a-4c59-9094-d0bdd33c17d9&feed=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0042-marreck%2F&hide_cover=1&hide_tracklist=1&replace=0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"180\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/0042-marreck/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=resource_link\">0042 // Marreck</a> by <a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=profile_link\">Stray Landings</a> on <a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=homepage_link\"> Mixcloud</a></p>\n",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> Prosthetic Pressings\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> 12”/Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 02/02/2015</p>\n<p>New York based producer Greg Schappert, aka Donor is perhaps best known for his forbidding analogue experiments with Truss (or MPIA3). Their joint efforts have seen a healthy release catalogue develop, the combination of their slightly off-kilter approaches to techno resonating with those looking for something more raw and adventurous.</p>\n<p>Recently however, Schappert’s efforts have set on producing his debut LP, <em>Against All</em>. This is an album with which he seems to have pinpointed and amplified those factors most defining of his previous work.</p>\n<p>Arguably, <em>Against All’s</em> greatest forte lies in it’s ability to remain club-ready whilst still providing something of the unexpected. Perhaps this is down to Donor’s deviation from conventional 4/4 percussion. ‘Fault Is Found’ or follower ‘Own Exile’ calling to mind Objekt’s frenetic percussive workouts with their close-knit kick patterns and nagging hi-hats. ‘Menace Is Mine’ is similarly abstract in its approach, exchanging snares for rasping breath-like textures, indistinct and mechanical alongside Donor’s rumbling drone of low-end.</p>\n<p>His unremitting use of sub-frequencies is another constant throughout the LP. Even those tracks where penetrating kicks seem to be the driving influence - they are often forced to blast through a wall of similarly resounding bass textures. ‘Calling’ sees this technique used in the most extreme as the track rises in intensity with the aid of Donor’s swarming percussion and vapourous soundscapes. In other places the effect is put to more subtle use - ‘Station A14’s stuttered kicks rolling between resonating high-end and sidechained low-end, swelling ominously.</p>\n<p>An interplay between dense rhythms and thick, fog-like atmospheres has been a constant of Schappert’s work until this point, giving his releases a disorientating, claustrophobic aesthetic. This signature has been delivered with great skill and creativity here, <em>Against All</em> aligning a range of different approaches to techno with rare grace.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/185140232%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-6EZng&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"350\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> Blackaxon Records\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> 12”/Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 15/12/2014</p>\n<p>Better late than never so the idiom goes. Jay Clarke’s debut on his own Blackaxon label at the end of 2014 saw the London based producer step up in assured fashion to release his own material. Productions aimed firmly at the dancefloor with enough style and melodic nous to set it apart from your typical white label debut. Having had support from some of the most noted DJs in the world for his productions (early fans including Ben Klock), the ‘First Flight’ EP sees Clarke finally stepping out with some strong, faultless music of his own.</p>\n<p>'The First Glimpse of Light' starts the EP off with smouldering rhythms, weaving expert grooves and muffled textures into something truly danceable. This is subtle and engaging dancefloor music, Clarke’s ability to build tension and string loops into tangible, lively rhythms demonstrates his skill as a producer and perhaps belies his anorak-like knowledge of the genre. 'The Black Lodge' clatters along in a similarly reverb soaked fashion, although the intensity here is paired down to give more space for the whirling atmospheres and jackhammer percussion peeking through the mix.</p>\n<p>The stand out track is undoubtedly ‘Vanishing Act’ however - it is quite frankly a dancefloor monster. Its unsettling melody drives deep kick drums along a compelling and twisted path. Just as you get used to the jagged melody Clarke switches up the progression leaving small moments of dissonance as the chords change, it’s an incredibly successful technique that leaves the listener in twists and knots.</p>\n<p>Jay Clarke has been a pretty well-kept secret until now; perhaps only familiar to those in the know across the London Techno circuit. Having been a resident for the popular VOID party at Brick lane’s Café 1001, it’s nice to see Clarke’s enthralling take on dancefloor techno finally getting a proper home. The launch of Blackaxon sees him take complete control over his own output, and with a string of releases in the pipeline for 2015 we should be seeing a lot more of Jay Clarke in the coming months.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/171168147&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

From Cronenberg’s ‘The Fly’ to R. Crumb’s graphic reimagining and even an appearance in The Simpsons, the angst and horror of The Metamorphosis never seems to leave our collective unconsciousness, no matter how many times we try and exorcise it. The latest instalment of these recurring nightmares comes from Asturian-born producer Reeko, this time bringing the anguish of Gregor Samsa into the world of brooding techno…</p>\n<p>The EP opens with a soft, icy pad, enveloping the stereo field like a giant white sheet and framing the mood of the whole release. This functions as a kind of modern equivalent of tuning an orchestra; wetting the sonic palette and teasing out the flavours to come. We then have three movements; ‘Capitulo’ I-III, and with each new act a new dimension to the plot is added. I moves at the earthy, subterranean level, grounding the subs into immovable foundations, whilst II pushes things further into more technical and trippy realms. By the third act, we are in seriously avant-garde techno territory, and this is the highlight of the release for sure.</p>\n<p>Indeed, by the final track, the record has undertaken the kind of drive that we find in Kafka’s Metamorphosis - there is no real release or escape from its dynamic push, and instead every track insists of piling on more and more intensity, like a never-ending roller-coaster that can only go up… But it’s worth pointing out here that this is but part one in a two-part series, the second half of which is expected to come later this year. With this in mind, the EP (or half-album) should perhaps not be considered as a distinct, discrete whole, but rather as mere hint at more to come soon. If this is anything to go by, then part two is going to be fucking mental.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/191724601&color=958d8d&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Laurie Osbourne aka Appleblim has one of those faces which has become synonymous with late-noughties dubstep. Co-founder of the legendary Skull Disco label alongside Sam Shackleton, Osbourne is also owner of the Apple Pips label, and has been a fixture at some of the most important nights in dubstep, such as FWD&gt;&gt; or Scuba's Sub:stance.</p>\n<p>In the production world, Osbourne has been a frequent collaborator, appearing on records with the likes of Ramadanman, Komon and Gatekeeper, garnering attention for his off-kilter drum programming and dub inflected synth-work.</p>\n<p>With a new collaboration on the horizon this time with Houndstooth favourite Second Storey, we decided to catch up with Osbourne, to discuss his upcoming performance at Bloc festival, studying at Bath Spa, and what's next in store for the now London based artist.</p>\n<p><strong>The first time I saw you play was back in 2010 at Berghain's Sub:stance night just when Berlin seemed to be getting steadily into Dubstep. Do you think your approach to DJing has changed much since then?</strong></p>\n<p>Hmm not really, I mean I try to be as eclectic as possible these days, within the context of the event. I wouldn't start dropping prog-rock at Rinse.fm at MoS, however I will play Grime, House, D&amp;B, Electro, Noise etc. That stems from my experience warming up at FWD&gt;&gt; or Sub:stance being given the freedom to play with people's heads, playing some quite ambient/sparse music on a massive soundsystem or even some jazz is a great experience all round. My mate Gatekeeper put it well the other day, you have to remember that essentially you're getting to hear a load of music you like really loud on a good soundsystem. The enjoyment of that should be the start of any vibe at a DJ gig.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/188099244&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>You're making an appearance at this year's Bloc – you've performed at the festival before right? How were the previous experiences and what can we expect this time round?</strong></p>\n<p>Well there's quite a few different snapshots - the first time I played was as 'Skull Disco Soundsystem' with Necta Selecta, Shackleton, and maybe Pev too. The response was brilliant, I mean it was in the pub bit of Pontins which was great - like an episode of Phoenix Nights or something! It was very sweaty, people were climbing on the speakers and the stage - proper shirts off raving. I remember tunes like 'Roll With The Punches' by Peverelist getting pulled up! That was exciting as it was the first tome I'd seen music made my people I know illicit such strong responses, very exciting and one of the major buzzes of being involved in music. Then I played for Subloaded on their stage at Bloc a couple of times. Always great vibes, getting Crazy D hosting, or Dread MC, or Sgt Pokes - these were great hosts and it's such fun to play crazy new rhythms and watch them react...</p>\n<p><strong>You've done a fair few different 12”s with Komon over the last couple of years – how did the two of you first meet? What do you think it is about the collaboration that works so well?</strong></p>\n<p>We met through Wedge/Bleecker and Addison Groove/Headhunter. Him, Tony Addison and White Boi used to do a show on a pirate station in St. Pauls when it was still pretty gully around there, so we went and played on that, and they played on Wedge's Sub FM shows. Friendships were formed - Komon helped us move house from Bath to Bristol when we barely knew him, testament to his nature!</p>\n<p><strong>Anything new in the pipeline for Apple Pips? You had an amazingly fruitful year in 2013 with six different releases, why the break over last year?</strong></p>\n<p>Life man! I've moved back to London, and have been concentrating on my own work in the studio which is finally bearing fruit. Apple Pips will definitely be back this year with both some solo and some collab work... I've got a lot stockpiled which I'm actually really happy with so that's good.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8599/16122050693_e51a7369cd_z.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong>I looked at the same course you were on at Bath Spa (and really regret not taking the position!) How much of an influence do you think the course had on you in general? Were you producing much before?</strong></p>\n<p>I wasnt producing at all, so really it formed me entirely, but it was the combination of both the course, the other people on the course, my producer housemates and having the time and space to start the Skull Disco label. All that combined... but the course definitely made me think about music more deeply - it helped me see it's potential, to see that all sound can be music. It also developed my love and respect for experimental music.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/39010425&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>What kind of thing were you listening to growing up? Was electronic music always the focus?</strong></p>\n<p>Well pretty standard white-middle-class-male listening I’d say! Hip-Hop, Pop lots of Indie and noisey guitar music. I was a real NME reader and actually found a lot out about stuff like the Ragga Twins, Shut Up and Dance and Autechre through the NME. Also the rave era was happening when I was at school so tapes were going round - Colin Dale, Colin Faver, Top Buzz, Easygroove etc. I went to my first rave in '92 at Hypnosis with Sasha, Jumpin’ Jack Frost and Njoi all on same lineup!</p>\n<p><strong>Have you noticed much of a change in the Bristol scene over the last few years? There still seems to be a lot of interesting things going on in the city although the focus has changed somewhat – any producers/collectives in particular you have been keeping tabs on as of late?</strong></p>\n<p>Its hard to say because 'our music’, the bass scene or whatever you want to call it, definitely refracted and after Pinch stopped doing Dubloaded. It definitely felt that house was taking over a bit. Of course you had Young Echo and so on who did great experimental nights at their studios which were ace, but these were much smaller nights than the 1000+ raves Pinch was doing at one point. I’m sure there’s tonnes going on under the surface but I’m less in touch as I have been doing much more inward looking self-exploration on my own vibe in the studio, rather than going out raving or DJing recently.</p>\n<p>There’s a great new night back on at the Old Croft called 'Who Cares’ which is a core of people from the bass days plus some others who wanted to bring back the vibe of Dubloaded - midweek, positive vibes, and they do a cool thing where there’s a bunch of residents like NY Transit Authority, Jus Now, Break, Addison Groove, Joker and so on, and then they get one or two secret headliners every time as well. It’s great to see new people in Stokes Croft catch the inclusive and positive vibe of these DJs and musicians, it’s a real Bristol family affair…</p>\n<p><strong>You’ve talked quite a bit about your formative years playing FWD&gt;&gt; nights at Plastic People, how did it feel to hear about the club’s closure?</strong></p>\n<p>Very sad but I bet they do something else. To be fair i think they struggled with the sound restrictions, and maybe it’s good to move on and try something new…</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/90574430&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p>Our debut 12&quot; comes from Japanese sound-artist Yu Miyashita/Yaporigami. We first became aware of his work two years back, upon the release of his stunning <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdigk5DMYkI\">Sync/Body</a> collaboration with visual collective <a href=\"http://brdg.tokyo/\">BRDG</a>. His blend of atmosphere rich sound-design and fragmented techno felt distinct and refreshing. After contacting Miyashita and arranging a <a href=\"http://www.straylandings.co.uk/post/60644614647/0021-yu-miyashita-yaporigami\">mix/interview feature</a>, we quickly realised that his work was some of the most unique music we had heard in some time, and decided it needed to be exposed to a wider audience.</p>\n<p>This EP, 'Grind Analysts Fig.1' sees the union of Miyashita's two projects; the a-side being occupied by the relatively dance-floor centric tracks he crafts as Yaporigami, whereas the b-side is reserved for the haunting atmospheric soundscapes he composes under his birth-name.</p>\n<p>Included with the 12&quot; we have also put together an accompanying booklet, seeking to reveal some of the processes we went through when making the record. It features an interview with Miyashita, as well several labels and artistic collectives (including BRDG) with which he has worked closely over the last few years.</p>\n<p>'Grind Analysts Fig.1' will be available as part of a limited 100 copy vinyl run from early April, and digitally shortly after.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 550px; height: 241px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=621066452/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=e99708/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://straylandings.bandcamp.com/album/grind-analysts-fig-1\">Grind Analysts Fig.1 by Yaporigami/Yu Miyashita</a></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Butlins has had somewhat of an unlikely affair with electronic music festivals. Hosting parties such as Bangface on a regular basis, the comfort of sleeping in a chalet is tempered by the fact the event stages fulfil roles as bowling alleys and bingo halls as their usual functions. This provides an almost postmodern joke that underlies a festival like Bloc; putting brooding artsy electronic music in close proximity to dodgems, fairground rides and crazy golf courses. But if you can get over the challenges of trying to dance on beer soaked, technicolour 80s carpets, Butlins can be a pretty entertaining setting for such events. It can also be an important grounding experience; no matter how profound the music might seem, don’t forget that you’re essentially in a big arcade.</p>\n<p>Compare that to the event at Pontoon Docks in 2012. A sense of anger and confusion rippled through the festival as rumours of overcrowding and imminent closure start to emerge on Twitter. ‘That’s it’ people said; Bloc is over. As much as that was a pretty disastrous event, its tedious to keep bringing it up. Through a series of one-off parties at Hackney Wick’s Autumn Street Studios, Bloc have managed to recover their reputation to the point of being able to throw another full-blown weekender at their former home in Minehead.</p>\n<p>Alongside returning to Butlins, the bookings felt like Bloc had also made a return to their former sonic roots. Where the Pontoon Docks event felt quite diversified with acts like Steve Reich, MF Doom and Snoop Dogg, this year featured a canalised line-up of almost exclusively electronic acts.</p>\n<p>Stroboscopic Artefacts signee Donato Dozzy was one of the first to play, opening the weekend with thumping, Chicago-influenced warehouse techno. I had expected the earlier sets to take a more subdued approach - easing the audience into the weekend’s proceedings. Yet the no-nonsense stomp of Dozzy’s assorted dance-floor selections against a backdrop of glaring strobes provided a refreshing but intense opening to the weekend. Livity Sound’s abstract mix of grime techno followed, as Peverelist, Kowton Asusu showed a mastery of live FX processing and stuttered drum programming.</p>\n<p>Some stages were subject to sound issues - Hessle Audio’s set, for instance, was plagued by crackles and volume flux. Having been one of the first labels that we truly loved, Hessle’s presence is always welcome at these events. They’ve done their time, and now they facilitate a space for newer acts to fill. ESG also fell victim to technical issues - the cavernous setting didn’t lend itself well to their intricate percussion, and the Soul Jazz Records signees had to battle against crowd chatter.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/16721539958\" title=\"Dean Blunt by straylandings, on Flickr\"></a></p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/16721539958\" title=\"Dean Blunt by straylandings, on Flickr\"><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7655/16721539958_442d8e0215_z.jpg\" alt=\"Dean Blunt\"></a>\n<em>Dean Blunt</em></p>\n<p>The Carhartt stage had arguably the best sound of all the stages, and perfectly accommodated Akkord’s formidable half-step techno. Synkro’s background in D&amp;B was audible as ever through the set. Warped breakbeats snaked across the stereo field with clinical precision. Afterwards we sit watching the French Sci-Fi ‘La Planet Sauvage’ in the main pavilion, when two notably floaty individuals approach us. “Can you roll us a joint?” they ask, “we’ve taken too much acid”. They follow us to Call Super and the tight, Krautronic bleeps set them off into a swaying trance. The main stage culminated with Karenn’s pulsing warehouse jams. The novelty of seeing an entire table of drum machines and FX will likely never ware off.</p>\n<p>The dualism between the brooding music and budget family holiday setting was perhaps most baffling during Positive Centre’s set at Bloc’s rather aptly titled ‘Pub’ stage (it is literally just a pub). Having previously seen Jefford in an abandoned power plant, shoulder to shoulder with legions of black-hoodie clad techno goths, his meditative blend of drone and techno didn’t seem quite right at two in the afternoon in a building styled like a smaller version of my local Wetherspoons. This said, the setting didn’t get in the way of Jefford’s expertly executed set, providing plenty of bass-weight for those who still managed to stumble to and fro after the previous night’s events.</p>\n<p>Luckily, Young Echo’s Vessel didn't suffer the same fate, setting the standard for the rest of the day at a dizzying height. The Bristol based artist shifted daringly between various nightmarish scenarios; from abstract electronica and mangled post-punk breakbeats to squealing noise and spatial krautrock synth jams. The performance felt expertly planned, and yet there was also a natural, improvisational quality to it as well. As Gainsborough cut sharply to silence at the end of the performance, the audience seemed stunned for a few seconds before ubiquitous cheers of appreciation filled the room.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/16690563287\" title=\"Moritz by straylandings, on Flickr\"></a></p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/16690563287\" title=\"Moritz by straylandings, on Flickr\"><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7622/16690563287_717c95d55d_z.jpg\" alt=\"Moritz\"></a>\n<em>Moritz Von Oswald Trio</em></p>\n<p>After Vessel’s rushingly intense performance, the mellow dub jams of the Moritz Von Oswald Trio seemed all the appropriate. They acted as a kind of palette cleanser with clean, calm, downtempo grooves colouring the mood of the room. Without Sasu Ripatti at the helm of the percussion, the trio lacked a certain tightness. Yet I felt a certain allegiance to the group; here was a band who had essentially started a whole new genre; taking the dub techno model to a jazz set-up.</p>\n<p>We can thank Helena Hauff’s hectic array of drum machine patterns and electro for setting the festival back into full swing. After beginning DJing in Hamburg a few years ago, Hauff has built an international reputation for playing an extensive variety of music that goes beyond the polished sound of most house and techno prevalent throughout the festival. We were treated to entire libraries of dance music, and her masterful control of the decks seemed to awaken many of the festival goers from their lethargic slumbers. One of the most anticipated sets of the weekend came from Dean Blunt, whose intriguing personal and artistic life is enough to bring crowds from all backgrounds. The cap and moustache combo, his personal bouncer on stage and his stark vocal style have all contributed to his ‘outsider’ persona, and for those looking for some weirdness in his set would not be disappointed. For almost ten minutes, the set opened with a repeated loop from an interview from Khalid Abdul Muhammad that read “the white man’s world we feel is coming to a close” over the sound of avalanching rubble. From there we were treated to a series of broken ballads, half tempo and distorted, before an epic 20-minute interlude of harsh strobe lights and white noise. As Blunt left the stage, there was an enormous sense of confusion on the faces of the audience members. “What just happened?” I heard someone say, as we all came to.</p>\n<p>Since winning the Mercury prize, Jon Hopkins has enjoyed a level of success that is usually only reserved for acts who have working for decades in the scene. The fact that he occupied a slot directly before Autechre probably says more than anything else. The juxtaposition between the two performances was staggering, almost ludicrous. Where Hopkins' hyper-polished, dancefloor electronica worked into a comfortable 4/4 rhythm, Autechre's two hour assault of battering low-end and circuit bent percussion was nauseatingly intense.</p>\n<p>Where Hopkins’ accompanying visuals could've been pulled straight from an Vans advert - skateboards, sunsets and so on, Autechre switched off all lights for their entire set, plunging the Main Stage into darkness. You could call Autechre’s set breakbeat or glitch, but the tempo modulated to such a degree that catching the rhythm at any point was a near impossible task. Autechre don't agree to gigs regularly, and the Bloc appearance showed that when they decide to, they do things properly. With no lights, rhythmic repetition or even melody of any kind, there was nothing tangible to cling to in the entire set. A quick survey of the audience saw a sea of people completely spellbound - all with heads down and eyes closed.</p>\n<p>Having seen more than enough fists pounding to techno kick drums, Sunday finally opened itself to some variety in its selection of dance music. Seeing as Bloc was already a huge nostalgia trip it seemed only right to dive straight in to a tribute to the old school jungle sound with Doc Scott, Raime and Ben UFO reviving some of the grittier roots of UK underground music. The true hero of the night was definitely MC GQ, animating the crowd to the most beautiful peak at the top of which was Dillinja. Certification, as if any was ever needed, that jungle is massive.</p>\n<p>With a day almost entirely dedicated to throwback jungle, one could argue that Bloc have lost some of the forward-thinking ethos that they were once known for. Indeed, Bloc feels like a work in progress in some respects. There have been reports of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/728689533892141/permalink/820982971329463/\">heavy-handed security</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BLOCWKND/status/573827264158306304\">gender disparity in the line-up</a>. These are issues that must be resolved if Bloc wants to stabilise itself for future events. But the passion is there, and the crowd show every level of enthusiasm needed for its rehabilitation.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> Aboretum Records\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> 12”/Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 14/04/2015</p>\n<p>Most records struggle to stand out in the way that Drøp's 2014 'Vasundhara' EP did. Lurching broken-beat rhythms cut between churning noise, experimenting with rhythm and texture in a way that felt fresh and unchartered. To top it all the release was rounded off with a gorgeous screen printed sleeve - like a cell under the microscope, magnified with absolute clarity.</p>\n<p>The imprint responsible, Aboretum, have finally got round to releasing their second 12&quot;. This time label head Marco Berardi aka Mogano is the author of the tracks, bringing something of the celestial to the label's abstract brand of techno.</p>\n<p>The 'Sycomore' EP is laced with eastern timbres, sweeping cinematically between Berardi's off-kilter drum patterns. Take opening track 'Retama'. Drenched in echo and reverb, a haunting string motif dances hazily between the track's ambling, sparsely placed rhythms. 'Anunnaki' picks up pace considerably, whilst still following a similar format. The drums here feel more muscular and cemented, yet the wave of ringing steel pan atmospherics still refuse to give way under Berardi's thundering toms.</p>\n<p>Downwards signee Samuel Kerridge's interpretation of the track on the other hand belies anything previously recognisable. It is 'Anunnaki's snarling, devilish cousin - sounding as if it had been spat from an exhaust pipe, blackened by smog. Kerridge's warped vocal textures and steady motorik drum patterns vaguely recall the likes of Throbbing Gristle or The Normal, bringing something of the noisier sub-sects of the new-wave scenes to the platter.</p>\n<p>The climax of the release, 'Sycomore', comes right at the end as you might expect. What you might not have expected however is the sheer force of Berardi's closing offering. The track is not listened to so much as felt - sub loaded kick drums pummelling the listener into a state of submission.</p>\n<p>Aboretum have had their fair share of problems when it comes to pressing records. The latest release follows around twelve months after their debut by Drøp - delays with their pressing plant leaving the label with a tortuously long wait between releases. With this in mind, the release of Berardi's 'Sycomore' EP is all the more gratifying, taking on the feat of matching the first record's dizzying quality, and doing a fine job of it.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/198291996&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>It might not be the first place you think of, but on consideration Iceland has had a pretty rich history where electronic music is concerned. Of course it’s been responsible for titanic names such as Bjork or Sigur Ros, however the scene extends far beyond that. Arnvidur Snorrason, aka Exos is one who has witnessed its evolution, pushing a broad spectrum of techno since the late 90s. When we caught up with him ahead of his performance at Fabric on the 11th, he was optimistic about the current state of the Icelandic scene.</p>\n<p>“Techno in Iceland is like the weather - it changes very fast” he considers. “Sometimes I can get away with playing really banging techno in our local clubs and people love it - other times they are not so ready for it. But I think techno has risen in popularity all over the world over the last few years - you don't have to feel like an outsider, like it used to be. We have a lot of very talented DJs and artists in Iceland and a very open-minded electronic music scene in general.”</p>\n<p>In his own career, Snorrason has come to be one of the most respected figures on the Nordic techno circuit, mixing rugged analogue jams and glacial dub-techno with the kind of skill that can only be obtained by years of obsessive practise. Although this might suggest he was to some extent born to do it, Snorrason insists his career path wasn’t actually so straight forward. “I never decided to become a DJ” he states when asked about his formative years. “I’ve been a music freak since I was a child - my father was responsible for that. He showed me everything from African music to bebob jazz, and by the age of four, I was translating lyrics by Grandmaster Flash. I began to DJ at my school at the age of 12, and it's continued ever since... I began producing when I was 16, when my dad bought me some gear back in 1996. We made some really deep sounds - before that I was a drummer. Then after a few years of making music I began releasing on Thule Records and Mosaic.”</p>\n<p>Having recently put out a remix for Allen Saei, aka Aubrey, 2015 looks to be a busy year for Snorrason. Alongside a reissue of his ‘Q-Box’ EP on Thule, his LP <em>My Home Is Sonic</em> is set to be re-released on Delsin, and a track written with Nina Kraviz entitled ‘No Criminals’ will also be released through Kraviz’s label Trip in the coming months.</p>\n<p>Despite his regularly touring, April’s visit will be the first time Snorrason has visited London’s Fabric nightclub, however it certainly sounds like he’s planning on making the most of the trip. &quot;I have heard it has one of the best sound-systems on the planet and I am definitely going to test that out. I’ll be playing a mix of vinyl and CDs - old and new music and a lot of unreleased stuff from my homeboys in Iceland - Thor, Introbeats, Oculus and myself.”</p>\n<p>His mix for us provides a taster of what can be expected at the Fabric appearance, covering an hour and 40 minutes of house and techno, becoming progressively more wild and untamed as the mix progresses.</p>\n<p>No tracklist available.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"60\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?embed_type=widget_standard&amp;embed_uuid=8924668f-2065-4bd0-9ea7-eb5fd72dff74&amp;feed=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0043-exos%2F&amp;hide_artwork=1&amp;hide_cover=1&amp;hide_tracklist=1&amp;mini=1&amp;replace=0\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/0043-exos/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=resource_link\">0043 // Exos</a> by <a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=profile_link\">Stray Landings</a> on <a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=homepage_link\"> Mixcloud</a></p>\n",

Never been a true household name yet not completely estranged from the spotlight either, the novel nature of their work has earned them slots alongside the likes of Kraftwerk and even an appearance on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uRZrqO6j8\">MTV</a>. But their presence in recent years seems to have evaded the public eye, and the duo are long overdue for commemoration.</p>\n<p>Since the infancy of the project in the mid-90s, Retina.IT have grounded their work in analogue hardware. This gives their sound a rich, sturdy quality, but there is also a clear ‘live’ kind of feel to it as well. You can hear each composition unfold at a natural, organic pace. Take ‘Logos’, for example, with its proliferating layers of fractal patterns. Or the corporeal hums of the EP’s finale, ’Aesculapius Dreams’.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a step back for a moment to admire the audacious title of this EP: The Occult Philosophy. What on earth could this refer to? The spirit of their musical ethos? The transcendental nature of music itself? The sound itself does have something inexplicable about it. The synths feel familiar and recognisable, and yet the grooves are unmistakably modern. Indeed, for all their linkages to the past, Retina.IT remain a contemporary outfit. Their last EP, ops_ci was available on cassette - which has become an ironic emblem of stylistic modernity in 2015. The EP also has clear nods to Rrose, Demdike Stare and the Stroboscopic cohort, who also seem fixated on occult aesthetics.</p>\n<p>What we have here is not a relic from the past but something from pioneering musicians with years of practice under their belt. The most important thing is that they are still looking for ways to mess with our expectations.</p>\n<p>Words by George McVicar</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2659429068/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless=\"\"><a href=\"http://semanticarecords.bandcamp.com/album/retina-it-de-occulta-philosophia-vol-1-semantica-71\" target=\"_blank\">Retina.it – De Occulta Philosophia Vol.1.

    "content": "<p>Lofthaus is the joint project of Thomas Barnes and Henry Gillet. Together, along with Marie De Cuir, they form 'Algebra of Need'; a collective outlet for a range of art forms including cassette, vinyl, text and film. “We all trust what the other writes and don't care if it isn’t &quot;marketable&quot; - something that is sonorous is far more important” Barnes explains. The collective take their name from a Burroughs poem, and this should give you some indication of the squalidness of their work. The latest release from AoN, for example, is an EP entitled “Alive with Pleasure”, which, according to their Bandcamp, &quot;attempts to show the true emotional side of lust.&quot; The EP itself lifts its name from a condom advertisement, and takes issues like premature ejaculation as its subject matter.</p>\n<p>When pressed on the concept behind the 'Alive with Pleasure' release, Barnes muses; “I have always found hooking up a sort of Russian roulette. You basically judge someone on purely aesthetic qualities then take a leap of faith, and you do all this because you have a hormonal or social drive to do so. Most songs about making love and romance are contained in a certain style and sound, but for me there is no music about the dirty side of love. I find darker music suits these emotions better. The concept for 'Alive With Pleasure' was to try capture this cluster fuck.” He isn’t kidding. Lofthaus’ productions have a notably disquieting, seedy quality to them. ‘Alive with Pleasure’, for example, opens with a dialogue from an 80′s porno. “Sexuality is one of the strongest forces in the Western world.” Barnes continues. “You need to look no further then companies making bikinis for six-year-olds and offering cut-priced Brazilian waxing to early teenagers. Look how they market pop stars to kids. It’s pretty disgusting, but oh so brilliant.”  Lofthaus have extended these concepts into the latest installment of our podcast series. The mix itself runs through three acts; from soundscapes to warehouse techno to degraded noise. Indeed, this narrative is intentional, as when we first began discussing the idea of a podcast, Barnes formulated the concept; “I find when doing a mix if you aren't playing to anyone at the time its hard to keep focus, so I like to have something to score or an idea to follow. We came up with the idea for this mix to kind of reinforce the idea of the EP in some shape; ‘a drug fueled one night stand - from surprise to accomplishment to shame’.” Listen below.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?embed_type=widget_standard&embed_uuid=258d9b93-b6c0-451f-a2df-fda3ad2fd9fb&feed=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0050-lofthaus%2F&hide_cover=1&hide_tracklist=1&replace=0\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<p>by <a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=profile_link\">Stray Landings</a> on <a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=homepage_link\"> Mixcloud</a></p>\n",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> Modal Analysis\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> 12”\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 20/04/2015</p>\n<p>Greek imprint Modal Analysis have had a pretty flawless run since their founding in 2012. They approach their records in a careful, considered manner - making sure each sounds unique whilst still maintaining a consistent aesthetic. Their latest 12&quot; managed to capture my attention before I’d even listened to any of the tracks, showcasing a rather intriguing collaboration between Greek experimentalist Biomass (Panos Kyveleas), and Italian improv-noise duo, R.O.M (Alessandro Quintavalle &amp; Luca Pastore).</p>\n<p>The so titled ’M.D.O.F’ EP (standing for ‘multiple degrees of freedom’) arguably deviates the furthest from Modal Analysis general blueprint. Despite their gritty textures previous records have felt wholly electronic - here the fact the ‘M.D.O.F’ EP  is the product of several unrestricted live jams with acoustic instruments is incredibly audible. If you give the record the attention it deserves, the details and nuances hidden within unfold continuously, revealing more of themselves with each listen. There is some ambiguity between which timbres are organic and what is synthetic - Kyveleas’ buzzing drones and R.O.M’s menacing free-jazz ramblings churn together as a single entity.</p>\n<p>Take opening track 'MDOF#1’ for example, it’s hard to tell where each artist’s work starts and finishes across the sparse, seething soundscapes Quintavalle’s earth-rumbling bass work almost indistinguishable alongside the bed of found-sounds and warbling synthesisers. Proceedings seem to get progressively warped as the release moves forward, 'MDOF#3’ working into a particularly gurgling climax, more unsettling than the darkest of Lynchian nightmares. 'MDOF#4’ maintains these surreal contortions, screeching woodwind building to a headache inducing climax around the track’s midpoint, before faltering to reveal Kyveleas’ muted static percussion.</p>\n<p>For the electronic avante-garde to fuse with the orchestral so gracefully is a rare occurrence, especially in an age where classical music meeting the electronic world usually results in some dodgy tech-house with a string track laid over the top. Biomass &amp; R.O.M have managed to present a release which explores the relationship between these two spheres with rare grace and originality.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/192778941&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>There are many reasons you might have heard of Christina Nemec. She is the founder of Comfortzone Records, producer Chra, and bass player of Blackest Ever Black favourites Shampoo Boy. Speaking of the 70s and 80s however, it appears Nemec’s focus wasn’t always on electronic music. “I grew up in a small town called Villach, close to the Italian border and the former Yugoslavia” she begins. “In the late 70s I loved hard rock, post-punk and of course Kraftwerk. I started to play bass guitar in the early 80s and moved to Vienna where there was a big post-punk/new-wave scene which I fell into. During the late 80s I played in several guitar bands. Inspired by Godflesh we started Bray a combination of a drum machine and 3 bass guitars.”</p>\n<p>Whlist Bray have continued along the metal route however, Nemec was drawn in by electronic music. Speaking on the scene in Austra, Nemec is rather animated. “Especially in the mid-90s when labels like Mego and Laton started, music changed. It was hip that time to listen to abstract music… funny! I really loved it - techno got way too commercial for me. These days Mego still exists and Fennesz is still around in Vienna, as well as some of the colleagues and friends I’ve also incuded in my mix. There is still a pretty diverse scene and some nice clubs as well.”</p>\n<p>Recently her passion for more abstract sounds has found a home in her glitch-laced solo project Chra, and as a part of Shampoo Boy, alongside Peter Rehberg and Christian Schachinger. When asked about her first meeting with the group however, Nemec’s story dates back long before the band’s formation. “Peter was DJing in the late 80s at a bar called Chelsea Bar in Vienna” she muses. “I heard Mark Stewart’s ‘Stranger Than Love’ for the first time in that set, and fell in love with it. Schachinger was playing in a noise-rock band that time - Occidental Blue Harmony Lovers. Soon after Peter moved to Schachinger’s apartment and they formed severals bands together and ran a fan zine. We started the group much later, having our debut release on BeB in 2013.”</p>\n<p>Alongside the two production projects Nemec founded her own label Comfortzone in 2009, originally as a platform to release her own material. As she explains however, Comfortzone soon evolved into something much more important. “I started the label release my debut album - I was in negotiations with labels, but didn’t want to wait so long. I also wanted to establish a platform to release lots of queer/feminist artists - as a member of female pressure I felt an urgent need to.” Comfortzone were responsible for one of our standout albums of last year, Reshaft’s <em>Decon</em>, and have pelty in the pipeline for 2015, including a 7&quot; record with Mika Vainio, and a compilation EP featuring various Vienna based female producers, including Gustav, Cherry Sunkist, Pasajera Oscura.</p>\n<p>Nemec’s mix for us covers an hour of the drone, ambient and leftfield techno with which she has been promoting in recent years, featuring several Comfortzone artists, as well as some of the projects with which she is involved with directly.</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Irradiation - Entropy [Temp Records]</li>\n<li>LCC - Quarz (Tujiko Noriki Remix) [Editions Mego]</li>\n<li>ZU &amp; Eugene Robinson - We’re All Friends [Trost Recordings]</li>\n<li>The Haxan Cloak - The Fall [Aurora Borealis]</li>\n<li>Reshaft - still_echo [Comfortzone]</li>\n<li>Cherry Sunkist - Glass [Comfortzone]</li>\n<li>Shelley Parker - Beachy Head [Structure]</li>\n<li>Klara Lewis - Shine [Editions Mego]</li>\n<li>Mika Vainio - Rasputin 3000 [Comfortzone]</li>\n<li>Fennesz - Becs [Editions Mego]</li>\n<li>Shampoo Boy - Riss [Blackest Ever Black]</li>\n<li>Chra - Snowbird [Comfortzone]</li>\n</ol>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"60\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?embed_type=widget_standard&amp;embed_uuid=fef3cc35-9824-4085-9c55-67c0437e3eea&amp;feed=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0045-chra%2F&amp;hide_artwork=1&amp;hide_cover=1&amp;hide_tracklist=1&amp;mini=1&amp;replace=0\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/0045-chra/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=resource_link\">0045 // Chra</a> by <a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=profile_link\">Stray Landings</a> on <a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=homepage_link\"> Mixcloud</a></p>\n",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> BleeD Music\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> 12&quot;/Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 11/05/15</p>\n<p>Promoters BleeD have been bending the rules of the London clubbing circuit since late 2010. Their bookings have brought many of the darker, more abstract strands of electronic music to the capital, without detracting from the fact BleeD events are in essence, still parties. The theme of mixing the abstract with the functional has also been used in the construction of BleeD’s debut record release, composed by founder Caspar Clark operating under his Volte-Face alter-ego. The ‘Charlatan’ EP recalls hours gone by in blackened warehouses, presenting a selection of five deeply hypnotic dancefloor trips.</p>\n<p>Considering it is the opener to BleeD’s frontier as a label, 'Until The Light Takes Us’ is notably intense. The track mounts to almost unbearable levels of pressure - Clark’s dizzying synth motif’s cutting through the air like helicopter blades getting progressively faster in preparation for take off. Alternately, Peder Mannerfelt’s recast reduces the track to it’s essentials, teasing out some wild modular squeaks and bleeps in the process.</p>\n<p>Despite the quality of the remix, Clark has arguably taken charge of presenting a diverse release quite well on his own however. The gliding, Deepchord reminiscent ‘Sine Qua Non’ for example is followed by Clark’s most deviant of offerings, 'IXAXAAR’. The track clatters forward loosely for its opening minute, before being snapped into line by a booming 4/4 stomp. Bleeps and blips echo through the fog, stuttered voices occasionally adding to the paranoia. The EP’s title piece, ‘Charlatan’ on the other hand closes the record with swathes of warm, dust-coated ambience. It feels to some extent like a ghostly echo of the track’s opening offering - thundering rhythms and rushing chords reduced to faltering melancholy soundscapes.</p>\n<p>BleeD have proved their value time and time again through their event series. Given that, alongside the creativity displayed across this debut release, their entry into the label game should only spell good things for the London techno scene. Watch this space.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/98039307&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Now with over a decade of releases under his belt, Spanish producer Juan Rico has become a well-established name within the International techno community. Under his various aliases Rico has extended his output to a diverse set of labels, including Oscar Mulero’s Pole Recordings, Ben Sim’s Theory Recordings, and mainstay Planet Rhythm Records. Following his latest release, a two-part reimagining of Kafka’s ‘Metamorphosis’, we caught with Rico to discuss Barcelona, Danny Elfman and the Birmingham sound.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/57060439&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>So to start things off, how has 2015 been for you so far? Quite impressive to have three releases out in three months!</strong></p>\n<p>There are still interesting things that need to be edited for 2015 but I’m sure it will be a great year overall, both in my professional career and personal life. It’s important changes in my life that give me the energy when it comes to production work.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about the ‘La Metamorfosis’ EPs? How did the idea come about? Should we treat the two as a split album?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, of course we can call it a split album. I liked the idea of doing a mini series of two parts, which could tell the story in another way. I think it’s always interesting to change ways of doing things, and in this case, I split the album into two parts instead of one. The whole idea came when my brother, who’s always had some influence on my creativity and always finds things to recommend to me that will often serve as inspiration for future projects, and usually film related, recommended that I read Franz Kafka’s ‘Metamorphosis’. He thought I’d like it and that I’d find some inspiration in it, though I don’t think he expected that ‘La Metamorfosis’ would be the outcome.</p>\n<p>I started to read the book during one of my flights and because it’s always noisy on the plane, I had the idea of putting some ambient music on my MP3 player as an improvised soundtrack. It was something really inspiring and casual, since I chose tracks that suited reading the book. Then, I came up with the idea of translating the story into techno, telling it in multiple chapters. In this way, I find it easy to create something; when you have a strong source of intense inspiration.</p>\n<p><strong>What drew you to Kafka’s work in particular? I’ve always thought of his novels as being perfect for reinterpretation for some reason, but I don’t think I’ve ever heard a musical reimagining before.</strong></p>\n<p>That’s the best part of it all. It also appeared to me as an innovative and different way of translating the book. I thought it was intense in the beginning, and I tried to express that in the music, using organic sounds - for example the insect on every track, striving to tell the story in a better way.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/3720704&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>You seem to put out around five releases every year under various aliases which is pretty crazy… How do you manage to maintain a level of enthusiasm? What keeps you inspired?</strong></p>\n<p>I don’t have this kind of performance every year, mostly because other years there have been circumstances, like trips for example where I have less time to edit releases… But yes, it’s true; between the projects I edit at least one album a year. I look for  inspiration by giving my albums a feeling and an argument. That kind of inspiration I get mostly from movies. I watch a lot of films and I find movies are a great source of inspiration.</p>\n<p>Sometimes an important personal situation can also inspire me in a great way. Recently I moved to Barcelona and this change has had a big effect on both my personal and professional life. I find much more inspiration over here and have much more energy than before. That’s why this year I’ll release a lot more than before under my two aliases.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/17424161876\" title=\"164433_535033619853338_818004793_n by straylandings, on Flickr\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/17424161876\" title=\"164433_535033619853338_818004793_n by straylandings, on Flickr\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8730/17424161876_05de9a0cfe_z.jpg\" alt=\"164433_535033619853338_818004793_n\" alt=\"\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of aliases, I’m a big fan of your dub work as ‘Architectural’ - what was the thinking behind starting that alias? Do you see it as necessary to have different monikers for each style that you explore? When do you know that a release is going to be under a certain name?</strong></p>\n<p>Architectural started during a musical transition I was experiencing, where I produced only one kind of techno, much more raw than what I produce nowadays and much more oriented towards the sound of the noughties. So I started to explore new sounds, to play around with dub elements. The first result was an edited EP on Music Man’s label under my ‘Humano’ alias, but that label in particular wanted me to release all my work under that alias with them and I didn’t like that idea. So, I decided to create my own project from the beginning, considering I had so much material. It was a new world for me! I could experiment with melodies and sound that I couldn’t use before, yet was able to keep the intensity in the tracks. It’s not that I believe that it’s important to have several aliases, there are people that have explored different styles and genres while still using the same name. That said, there are other artists like me that were tagged from the beginning with a specific and concrete style and it’s quite hard to get out of that.</p>\n<p>So, if I wanted to do something different, like Architectural, I had to create a new name. After all, I don’t want to leave out the techno of my origins! The truth is, I don’t believe there’ll be any doubt about what track will come out under Architectural or under Reeko. Even when the tracks could have some similar sounds, each project is very different. Architectural has a futuristic jazz vibe and it’s melodic, while on the other side, with Reeko, I experiment with new sounds which make the techno sound more organic and raw.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m also really fond of your explorations into ambient - is the genre something that you listen to often? Who are you listening to at the moment more generally?</strong></p>\n<p>I do listen to a lot of ambient and I have a lot of it on my mp3 player: ambient, experimental and composers  like Gustavo Santaolalla, Danny Elfman, Angelo Badalamenti and Alexander Desplant. Also, in the ambient and experimental world, people like KTL, Asmus Tietchens, Ryan Teague, Oren Ambarchi and many more. It is a genre that I find attractive and inspiring - especially tracks that last longer than 20 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>You’ve been DJing for what must be around 15 years now - what are some the shows that stick with you most? What makes a show memorable for you?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s very hard to say which one of them. From the more recent ones, I remember my first time in Buenos Aires’ Under club. I really liked the public’s reaction to my first four-hour-set. It was a very atmospheric and visceral session and I think the audience reacted as I’d hoped.</p>\n<p>What really makes a show  memorable is when I find the perfect mix between a comfortable booth and being close to the audience, coupled with a nice, clean and strong sound, and an audience willing to listen and feel.</p>\n<p><strong>Your Discogs page cited Birmingham as a reference for your live sets. How much of this is true? Is the work of Regis, Blackdog, Surgeon, Sandwell District etc important to you?</strong></p>\n<p>In the beginning, the music coming from Birmingham was very important and in Spain that style was quite successful. When I wrote my first albums, that’s why they have that sound – it has helped me write the techno I write today. But like everything, there are beginnings, and mostly when you’re young and don’t know other areas, you just do things in the tried and tested way. Nowadays, I think things have changed and the influences are there. Those artists influenced thousands of producers, including me. Year on year every artist has looked for his inspiration in different places. In my case, when I started to listen to different genres, you could tell by the way I produced my music. I think it’s important, but something you only learn over time.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally, what can you tell us about future projects you have coming up? Anything releases in the pipeline you can tell us about?</strong></p>\n<p>There are some tracks waiting to be released before the year ends. An EP with Pole Group that’ll be released in July, an EP with Soma after the summer and an album under my Architectural alias. So, it’s going to be a very busy year I guess!</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SXP_8wooesU\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> Fourth Wave\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> 12”/Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 04/05/15</p>\n<p>I’ve spent far too much time combing over Kevin McPhee’s 2012 Boiler Room mix trying to ID releases. Just about every track in the set was both unreleased and unidentified at the time of broadcast, from Bobby Champs’ swaggering ‘Krenshaw’, Boddika’s piston-firing ‘Steam’ and McPhee’s own dizzying WNCL release ‘In Circles’. Whilst these have all been slowly siphoned off over the years, there are still gems yet to see the light of day three years later.</p>\n<p>One such gem to be unveiled recently is ‘FRUMMPPP’, a collaborative release from McPhee and camera-dodging Delsin signee Gerry Read. Anyone familiar with their first meeting on ‘Demolition Man’ will be aware of the mayhem their combined efforts can bring, retaining a healthy amount of self-aware humour amongst the bravado.</p>\n<p>‘FRUMMPPP’ does share some similarities to their first offering in its jagged lo-fi thrills, but otherwise deviates quite a bit from ‘Demolition Man’. Staggering, fax-tone glitches and thickset, stomping 4/4 kicks mesh together, thundering brazenly from the commencement. There is something vaguely comic in the way the track swaggers forward cocky and unabashed, grinding synth-tones struggling to keep up with the incessant boom of low-end.</p>\n<p>On the flipside the pair have turned in a recast of the original, vaguely familiar of Gerry Read’s previous Fourth Wave offering ‘Legs’ with it’s mangled sampling and rough-edged, skittering house rhythms. Bumping, chopped-and-screwed house drums work into a chaotic frenzy alongside clipped vocals and misfiring computations.</p>\n<p>Read and McPhee are two artists who share much in common in their sonic outlook, and although only making up their second release together, ‘FRUMMPPP’ is just as joyously noisy and quirky an affair as ever. Let’s hope their next meeting won’t be too far off.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/204005655&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Emerging last year as the latest project of Taiwanese sound artist Lucia H Chung, en creux challenged us to reconsider the boundaries of minimal production. Her debut release, the mesmeric ‘Default 0003′ for SM-LL took the label’s manifesto of exploring repetition to the very limit, ticking static, modem bleeps and eery soundscapes.</p>\n<p>With her latest contribution to the imprint - ‘Default 0006′ having recently been made available, we caught up with Chung to discuss performance space, the problems with translation and the origins of the en creux project.</p>\n<p><strong>So first off how are things? You've just jetted off to Taiwan I believe - what are your plans while you're over?</strong></p>\n<p>Things are going ok! I recently had my second release on SM-LL, and I’m now thinking about the next project, although early days yet. Yes I am in Taiwan at the moment - back to see friends and family. I normally pop back twice a year if I can, although it can be quite a challenge as it’s a very different atmosphere here. The weather for sure is one of the huge difference between Taiwan and the UK. The food as well, it’s a very different mixture of flavours, spicier, sweeter, sourer… all the senses are exploding and intensified, which I very much enjoy.</p>\n<p>The general soundscape in the city is muddier and denser and you can almost feel the humidity and the heat of sub-tropical weather in all the sounds. I sometimes feel split between these two worlds, but people say this comes out in my work, so I guess that’s good.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/135929583&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>The en creux project was something you started on SM-LL exploring the idea of negative space - a term taken from a book by Michel Chion. Can you tell us a little bit more about your original inspiration for the project, and what you mean by 'negative space'?</strong></p>\n<p>Wow, this will probably take me a whole day to explain. I will try my best to make it short for you (laughs). The notion of en creux came through at the end of my research project in the music department at Goldsmiths, University of London. I was in the thick of the thesis writing, and had been grappling with my ideas without a specific term to describe or narrow them down. I was writing about Rachel Whiteread's 1990 sculpture <i>Ghost</i> and comparing it with Alvin Lucier's famous 1969 piece <i>I am sitting in a room</i> as I saw an interesting parallel between the materialisation of Lucier's voice in the space through audio recording and the reversed casting process in Whiteread's <i>Ghost</i>. The end result of both pieces is derived from the 'casting' process of the 'negative' of space. Whiteread's sculpture inverted the invisible part of a living space into a tangible and palpable object while Lucier's recording articulated the resonant frequencies of the room, which in turn, moulded the 'form' of the final outcome.</p>\n<p>I stumbled upon the term 'en creux' by pure accident - a very happy accident, if I may say. Michel Chion's notion of en creux was intended to describe the phantom perceptual experience from one sensory channel to another, a transference of psychological presences and absences through sound on screen. What really interested me was the translator's special note to the term. In the English translation of Chion's <i>Audio-Vision: Sound on Screen</i>, the term was translated as 'phantom,' yet the translator particularly pointed out that en creux in French 'properly refers to negative space - the shape of the space in a sculptor's mould, defined by the mould’. I found the semantic meaning of the phrase and the translation issue that arose fascinating and it encapsulated my research interests perfectly. So I took liberties to 'lift' the term and placed it in the context of my own practice to expand the notion to its broadest sense. So when Martin (owner of SM-LL) asked me if I would like to contribute to the label, I thought to use 'en creux' as some sort of guideline for the music writing process.</p>\n<p><strong>This latest release felt quite different to the first and much more affront in it's approach - do you think this was down to the fact you used the MFB Kraftzwerg for the release? When did you get the synth and what's the writing process like using it? What other hardware have you been using?</strong></p>\n<p>I bought the MFB Kraftzwerg about three or four years ago. In 2011, I got invited to do a solo performance at Jazz Servant Quarter in Dalston, for which I used a laptop and mixer feedback. That performance was quite a nerve wracking experience for me as there's no way to 'control' feedback entirely. All I could do for preparation was to spend time understanding the 'character' of the particular mixer I was using, how to converse or argue with it, how to make it 'tick', if you like (laughs). I realised that I really enjoyed this kind of physical interaction that was not only connecting things and turning knobs, but also the very process of getting to know a machine and its sounds by putting all your attention on a very single, minute detail. So after that performance, I started to looks for a machine that would be self-contained, that would allow me to focus all my attention on one single thing. It was simply love at the first sight. I wanted it as soon as I saw its image on the internet, and managed to track one down second-hand.</p>\n<p>I wouldn't say there's a particular 'writing' process with the recent en creux release that utilises Kraftzwerg. The structures of both tracks are straight recordings of me 'playing' with the synth, or rather, me 'listening' to it. I think the design of Kraftzwerg poses quite a bit of restriction as the board is pre-connected, very different from other modular synth, say the Roland System 100, which I have some experience with. There is, though, a pre-determined theme in both tracks. Noise, which is different from Default 0003 as it's the result of my sitting with two Fostex TT-15 tone generators and an Akai S20 sampler. I won't say it is more affront this time, I think it is just more focused. I think the aggressiveness of the sound is always there lurking in my music, for example in Colour of Quantum (2011), but Kraftzwerg definitely brings more punchiness to the sounds and lower frequencies to the overall spectrum.</p>\n<p><strong>I understand you have been doing a lot of live work in galleries - do you prefer the gallery space in general as a host for your music?</strong></p>\n<p>I think the connection to the gallery space comes from my roots in Fine Art. I obtained my first degree in Fine Art at the University of Education in Taiwan, which provided four years solid training for its students to become art teachers. I learnt basically everything there, classic pencil and charcoal drawings, watercolour and oil paintings, Chinese ink painting and Calligraphy, printmaking and sculpture. Into the second year of the uni, I very quickly found myself gravitating towards sculpture, particularly larger sculptures or installations incorporating space. Working and thinking in a spatial term has since become almost an instinct, and I naturally react to different spaces.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/71458170@N04/17573010675\" title=\"ec2 by straylandings, on Flickr\"><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5448/17573010675_cc08102fab_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" alt=\"ec2\"></a></p>\n<p>In some ways, the gallery setting does provide more freedom than a commercial music venue, as it is easier to move things around. In the gallery, you have to think about the layout, the dimension, the viewer's movement, the convergence of direct and indirect sounds, and other people's work. In a music venue, the stage and the speakers is generally pre-determined. You work with what you're given, and find the best setting you can get during the sound-check. Still, I always try to go to the venue to see the space before I start my preparation for the live performance if possible. Or I will ask for photos so I get a rough idea. In this sense, I guess the working process is pretty similar for me, and strange and new spaces always get me very excited (laughs).</p>\n<p><strong>You played for several years as part of Mimosa Moize with Martin Thompson aka Pokk! - is the project still ongoing? It had a bit of a resurgence last year with your contribution to a Quark release.</strong></p>\n<p>Martin and I met through my work in 2006. The subject of collaboration always came up in conversation but we both had doubts in the concept back then. I can't really recall what made us decide to finally work on something together. I guess we just gained confidence and trust in each other through working together on smaller projects. Mimosa Moize took shape in 2009 and has since been fortunate enough to work with many great labels and artists who had inspired its music. It might sound odd but the project has actually since taken on its own personality. Martin and I often talk about new projects/ideas for Mimosa Moize, but I don't feel 'it' has yet reached any mutual agreement with us (laughs). I'd say that Mimosa Moize is definitely 'alive' though in a dormant period at the moment. I get the feeling that it will come back totally transformed and become something very different. I am looking forward to it!</p>\n<p><strong>For those who don't know - can you explain a little bit about the Default series and its relation to SM-LL?</strong></p>\n<p>Default is a digital offshoot of SM-LL in two aspects. First of all the Default series is the digital release, serving as a stepping stone to SM-LL - limited pressed vinyl releases. Default utilises the digital platform to offer artists the opportunity to show their sonic experiments, it is particularly for new artists to the label. The work released on the Default Series can be a work-in-progress, a rough draft, and can even be a non-sound/music piece in the future; whereas, SM-LL will be the format for more full-fledged concepts and work.</p>\n<p>Secondly, I think the Default series functions as a reminder for SM-LL. The very first release planned for SM-LL was actually a 12&quot; vinyl, yet the budget fell short and the master plate had to be abandoned in the end. It was an unfortunate situation that's probably quite common for small independent labels. We felt that the desire and need to push new music shouldn't be stopped simply by financial difficulties, so Default was created to voice our ideas and to host the music that we believe in.</p>\n<p><strong>You’re working as a researcher at Goldsmiths University - can you tell us a little bit about your work there?</strong></p>\n<p>Ok... another hard one, and I will try my best to be short and concise (laughs). The research project at Goldsmiths was initiated by my chance encounter with American artist Roni Horn's work at the Tate Modern in 2009. Without any prior knowledge of the artist, I went to see the exhibition and was totally captivated (I have since seen the Thames in a totally different light). What struck me was the experience of encountering 'similar things in different forms,' which was achieved by her sheer concentration on the process of doubling through a variety of different mediums including sculpture, drawing, photography and text. It was the notion of circumstances in time and space created through her doubling strategy, which I found particularly fascinating. The narrative of the work only started to unfold in the consciousness of the viewer after the second encounter or 're-encounter' of the same or very similar work under the same or very similar circumstances taking place moments later. The very existence of her work lied in such narrative that it relied on the viewer's encounter and re-encounter, which was only possible through this process of doubling.</p>\n<p>Horn's aesthetic thinking and strategy of doubling lent me the essential vocabulary to articulate the core subject in my own research practice, which is the notion of translation, or rather the very process of translation, the act of crossing over and going beyond as the prefix 'trans-' denotes. The ideal of translation is to find the perfect rendering from one language to another. From my own experience of being bilingual, I realise that there's never a perfect rendering as there's always something that falls in-between two systems, something that is slippery and untranslatable. I am especially interested in the very moment of being caught in-between the process of translating. It's a very personal and transient place. It only takes place when particular circumstances arise, and I experience it in Horn's work through her doubling and pairing. So there is a lot of doubling going on in most of the work I have produced at Goldsmiths, sound becomes an aesthetic agent to induce certain circumstances for people to experience this transient place I'm talking about.</p>\n<p><strong>I really enjoyed that quote from Susan Stewart on the Default 0003 page , particularly the line, &quot;it is only by means of difference that identity can be articulated&quot;. What role does literary theory play in your music? To what extent do you think literary criticism is important for understanding music?</strong></p>\n<p>That's a very good question. To be honest, I don't really know whether I am influenced by literary criticism or not (laughs). One thing for certain is that language is very influential on my thinking about work. I guess criticism also comes from the training of conducting a research project, as you learn naturally to look at things contextually and critically. I think it is helpful when it comes to analysis of your own work, either to trace your own development or to place your work amongst your contemporaries.</p>\n<p>I think critical thinking is very helpful when it comes to understanding issues with music publishing, for example the conversion problem that Default 0006 has with MP3 online streaming. Certain frequencies do not translate well at all on the internet, yet sometimes you just can't do anything about it. In the case of Default 0006, both tracks (Noisewave and Düsseldorf generator) have this very weird digital distortion in the sound after uploading up to bandcamp. It is certainly an annoyance, and there is nothing we can do but to put a special note in the blurb. Despite the disappointment, I start to think about the notion of compression and that leads me to Jonathan Sterne's discussion on the meaning of music format and its impact on our experience with music.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally what's next for yourself? Any other projects in the works for 2015?</strong></p>\n<p>I feel like letting myself follow the flow for a bit this year after completing my PhD last year… I think there will definitely be more stuff coming from en creux project, some sort of physical release perhaps. I am also working on some sort of live performance set-up for en creux, and hopefully something will come along later this year. Apart from my own project, I am also helping Martin with SM-LL and so far we have some extremely exciting artists and releases in the pipeline. I think it will be a great year for SM-LL. I am very excited about it!</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/201406612&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>London-based Peur Bleue Records has been steadily building a reputation for itself off the back of a handful of\nreleases that have been in the nexus of techno, electro, drone, and ambient. A familiar combination perhaps, but as label boss Gohan, alias of Anatole Baboukhian is keen to stress, Peur Bleue ‘tends to be more than just another techno/dark ambient record label’. Peur Bleue means ‘shit scared’ in French, which should come as little surprise to anyone that has heard the eldritch sounds found on the label. But Baboukhian tells me that ‘though there’s an undeniable tendency to put some dark and scary tunes out, this is not the only direction we want to head towards’. He says that the next Peur Bleue release, from Nick Araguay, will prove that point.</p>\n<p>Much like Stray Landings, Peur Bleue began as a blog before becoming a label. Baboukhian decided to set the label up at the time he was readying his debut Gohan LP <em>Peur</em>, as he felt that the album, as a personal document, would be out of place on another imprint. Since then, he has released a pair of Gohan EPs, most recently the _Stabbed in Konya _EP earlier this year; a full album from Altkat; and a 12” from Nummer.</p>\n<p>To these ears the Peur Bleue sound is like a more electrifying cousin to fellow shadow dwellers Samuel Kerridge or the Blackest Ever Black label, combing through an exhilarating pool of influences such as early electronic music, Italian horror soundtracks, minimal wave analogue electronics, sound collage, and contemporary European urban musics, to create atmospheric electronic music that in Baboukhian’s words, has ‘narrative scope’. For Peur Bleue, telling a story is important. Reference points for this kind of theatrical, gallimaufry-like music include Demdike Stare and Dalhous – musicians with not just large record collections, but  extensive DVD collections too. Unsurprising then, is the refreshingly consistent visual style of the label, coordinated by Baboukhian’s graphic designer brother whom he runs the label with.</p>\n<p>The mix Gohan has put together for us is admittedly a ‘bad idea from a PR point of view’, offering a selection of some of the aforementioned influences rather than a straightforward introduction to the label. He says he has grown ‘a bit tired of doing techno-ish mixes recently’, and so apart from a few more predictable track selections such as tracks from Volte-Face and Peur Blue signee Altkat, the rest is a glorious collection of ‘different colours’, tracks he says he will ‘never get bored of’. To give just a flavor: the late English saxophonist Lol Coxhill occupies the same hour as North American underground pop musician D’eon, and pianist Keith Jarrett is found alongside black nationalist wordsmiths The Last Poets. There’s also some Vangelis too, operating under his 70s pseudonym Odyssey.</p>\n<p>Baboukhian is originally from Paris where as part of the Ego6 crew with his brother (who remains in Paris) and some friends he was influential in the development of grime in France. He cites the instrumental that Ego6 provided for Tempa T’s ‘Swing’, as a particularly proud moment. He professes to having always been an anglophile when it comes to the ‘modern music culture’ of the UK, being drawn in by everything ‘from Joy Division to So Solid Crew’. He moved to London six years ago, and so I wonder as a relative newcomer what he makes of the musical and cultural geography of the city, and particularly Peckham, where he is based.  He says the area is ‘a perfect example of the British taste for trying new things’, and highlights the new record shops such as Rye Wax that have recently opened, as well as the bars, clubs, and radio stations that have sprung up, which all help foster a sense of community lacking elsewhere. There is, of course, ‘a lot to say about gentrification and how poor neighbourhoods change in London’. With developers circling overhead the area is becoming increasingly unaffordable, but for now at least there are ‘plenty of possibilities for doing new stuff’. However as Baboukhian wryly remarks, herein lies the appeal for unwanted investors: ‘I think the corporate word for this is ‘vibrant’.</p>\n<p>Check out the Peur Bleue <a href=\"http://blog.peurbleue.com\">blog</a>, and listen to past releases and other mixes on their <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/thisispeurbleue\">Soundcloud</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Keith Jarrett - Köln, January 24, 1975 Part I [ECM Records]</li>\n<li>Rapoon - Donnez­-moi une cigarette [Alrealon Musique]</li>\n<li>d’Eon - #03 [Hippos In Tanks]</li>\n<li>The System - Vampirella [Romantic Records]</li>\n<li>Volte-Face - Charlatan [BleeD]</li>\n<li>Lena Platonos ‎– Shadows Of Blood [Kunstkopf]</li>\n<li>Peder Mannerfelt - In Place Of Once Was [Digitalis Recordings]</li>\n<li>Altkat - Errant sous la pluie [Peur Bleue Records]</li>\n<li>Lol Coxhill - Echoes Of Falmer [Tago Mago]</li>\n<li>Electronic System ‎– Skylab [Omega International]</li>\n<li>Jean-Pierre Mirouze ‎– Sexopolis [Disc’Az]</li>\n<li>Sun Palace - Rude Movements [Passion Records]</li>\n<li>Azymuth ‎– Amazonia [Milestone Records]</li>\n<li>George Duke ‎– Feel [MPS Records]</li>\n<li>Odyssey - Who [WWA Records]</li>\n<li>The Original Last Poets - Die Nigga!!!

    "content": "<p>The last time I saw Ryoji Ikeda was at the Brighton Dome. Not to slur the venue too much (I quite like it) but it is generally more inclined towards musicals, soft rock and stand up comedians. Although it was a little odd being in a club in the early evening as opposed to sloshing Jaegerbombs around at 4am, by comparison Village Underground's lofty warehouse setting combined with the venue's collosal soundsystem made a far more appropriate setting for the Paris-based sound-artist.</p>\n<p>Across his rather lengthy career, Ikeda has become a staple of the Raster Noton label, performing and orchestrating installations at reknowned arts venues including MoMA and even gaining himself a residency at CERN, the European centre for nuclear research. In doing so Ikeda has also earnt himself a place amongst the rare few electronic musicians to be adorned in both music scenes and the wider, more discerning world of modern arts. In this instance his visit to the capital occured as Ikeda tours 'Supercodex'; an performance using mathematical models and raw data sets to generate both music and visuals.</p>\n<p>Having missed the first round of tickets, I was delighted to nab a space after a further performance was announced due to 'popular demand'. Testament to the show's demand was the number in attendance for the second viewing - I had expected its late announcement to result in rather few numbers on the ground, however VU saw queues stretch right round the corner.</p>\n<p>After a lengthy wait, Ikeda materialised from the back rooms abruptly and the crowd fell to silence. Perhaps what was most engaging about his set was the careful mix between textures; some barely audible, but others played with such force they could be felt physically. Stuttering clicks and glitches danced between each other, steadily swarming into distorted cyclones of noise, tremor inducing low-end stabbing through clear and precise. Broken poly-rhythms would falter into moments of silence, leaving the audience unsure whether to applaud or wait for the next development.</p>\n<p>The performance culminated with one final frantic assault of breakbeat-paced glitch and blinding strobes, the flashes almost appearing to mesh together into a single, warping image as your eyes struggle to keep focus. Just as unexpectedly as the show had started, the screen cut to black and Ikeda swiftly departed from the stage with not so much as a word or even an acknowledgement that anyone else had been in the room at all.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> SM-LL\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> 12”/Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 29/06/2015</p>\n<p>Where many bemoan the monotony of modern electronic music, SM - LL reclaim it under clear unambiguous manifesto for the label’s sound: ‘We Like Repetition’. Their name, too — a truncation of ‘Sm(a)ll Fish in a Big Pond’ — is ideologically antithetical in its opposition to the predominant musical sphere, focusing exclusively on the niche and estranged. This is what keeps SM - LL constantly interesting and long overdue for recognition. Their latest release, ‘Batch 0000′ follows in this tradition, and comes from R.E.C, a duo based in Copenhagen.</p>\n<p>We spoke with R.E.C earlier in the week who described their project as something that “circulate[s] around a concept of raw and constantly evolving sounds”. This particular record can be seen as something of a departure from previous SM - LL output, as there is an undeniable dancefloor focus this time around. Whether it’s the frantic analogue bleeps of side A or the scratchy shuffle of B, both tracks sound like a modern techno record, but one that has been stripped of all it’s superfluous elements. Without the typical hallmarks of a traditional dancefloor record, the listener is invited to rethink the more exciting aspects of techno again, and let them blossom within a new sphere.</p>\n<p>It takes a few listens to realise that side B is actually the inverted, deformed cousin of side A. For the 12” itself, each side is cut at different speeds, which therefore means that there is altogether the potential for four versions of one track to be played. The end of each track, too, has a nihilistic conclusion, as we hear the tape recorder “dying and literally breaking”. This brings to mind the medium-is-the-message ethos of Christian Marclay’s abstract turntablism. Marclay’s work focuses on the supplementary qualities that a vinyl record can afford; the crackles and pops, the pitch bends, even the sound one makes when snapped in two. Back in 2005, Marclay wrote about vinyl in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/feb/14/popandrock\">an interview with the Guardian</a>;</p>\n<p><em>“[i]f the music in a groove fits with what you're playing, then play it; if not, then you can play it backwards. If that doesn't work, you try it at a different speed. If it really doesn't work you just break it”.</em></p>\n<p>The record is also limited to just 17 copies, and each comes with a three-word etching of your choice; keeping the notion of a collector’s edition well and truly alive. In essence, what I think both Marclay and R.E.C are hoping to achieve is something like a shift in perspective about the materiality of music. 'Batch 0000' is not merely just a recording of a performance, but an object of creative manipulation itself. This time, however, the collector’s edition is not a static antique, but something that can be stretched, distorted, warped, cut and fucked with as much as desired.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/205611957&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Pasquale Ascione, Davide Carbone &amp; Lucindo Cutolo seem to move as a pack. The trio of Italians were originally brought up in the same area, as they put it across “Vesuvian towns in Naples at the foot of the volcano&quot;. As many do, the group have since migrated to Berlin, seeking a more healthy techno scene and a location where their work might be more fully appreciated. The move appears to have been a clever one - through their productions Ascione and Carbone have made some rather significant movements over the last few years. Between their respective aliases (Ascion and D. Carbone) they have appeared on labels such as Sleaze, Drumcode, Black Sun and Modularz, and are also curators of the acclaimed Repitch Recordings along with another fellow Italian, Nino Pedone aka Shapednoise.</p>\n<p>However, despite the grounding Ascione and Carbone have built up for themselves over recent years, as they state when we caught up with them earlier this month it was Cutolo who stimulated their most recent project, 3TH Records. “Lucindo was already DJing in the local scene when we were about to start producing” they begin. “After several years, our paths crossed again. After spending time together, playing records and hanging out, we found some common interests and ideas. Lucindo started to write down some tracks showing us his ability with rhythms and so on. After a few months (this was three years ago now) the idea of starting another label was up in the air so we didn’t think twice before starting 3TH and building up its sound.”</p>\n<p>Since its establishment last year 3TH has acted as a platform to host the trios own music – the furthest deviation from that coming in form of an appearance from Carbone’s alter-ego Honzo. Despite being only five releases deep, 3TH have already built a reputation for crafting dark, brutish techno, the jarring industrial timbres frequented by the trio giving the label a rough-edged, almost punk feel. The curation of the label may be tight, but 3TH are keen to stress their releases are spontaneous rather than meticulously planned. “We don’t have any kind of scheme, it just happens” they begin. “For both [3TH and Repitch] there’s a kind of fusion of our tastes and this leads us to decisions. Basically we all already know what would work for the others.”</p>\n<p>Their contribution to our podcast series acts as a kind of guide to the label’s progression. In their words it: “tells the story of the label embracing different styles that characterize [its] sound, from experimental to dance-floor music, passing through industrial patterns and trippy textures.” The mix is crammed with 3TH’s own material, covering from the first release right up to the label’s next 12&quot;, ‘Public Head by Ascion’, due out at the end of May.</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ascion &amp; D.

    "content": "<p>Finnish artist Antye Greie Ripatti, better known as AGF, has chosen the title of ‘poemproducer’ for describing her work. Fusing themes of Westernisation and digital culture into her poetry and glitch-laced electronica into her productions, the tag doesn’t seem to do justice to the breadth of her output. Across her decade-spanning career, Ripatti has put over 20 releases to her name, and curated installation art at galleries across the globe.</p>\n<p>Ripatti’s latest project is an LP entitled 'A Deep Mysterious Tone’, an album that recontextualises Japanese poems from female authors spanning back hundreds of years. The aim of the project in part is to retell a chapter of history from a female perspective - a chapter all too often ironed out of art history. We caught up with Ripatti in the build up to this release to find out about at this, and her other projects first hand.</p>\n<p><strong>So how have you been? What have you been up to recently?</strong></p>\n<p>Well today I’m preparing for a show at Berghain with Holly Herndon for this record release party which is pretty cool. I haven’t played live in quite some time and I want to change my live set a bit. I’m used to performing with a laptop but this time I think I’ll try playing with the iPad. I don’t know how it’s going to work in a club but I think it’s more intuitive as an instrument than the laptop. I’m also thinking of playing some really old tracks - something like my ‘best of’ I think (laughs).</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/109222714&color=a8a3a0&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>How did the contact with Holly first come about?</strong></p>\n<p>I didn’t really know her work until I saw someone wrote in one of my reviews something like, “everyone’s bigging up Holly Herndon but AGF has been doing this for 10 years” and I was like “who is that girl?” Then I dug a little deeper and I thought “yeah it sounds like a similar approach at times, I like that” - I felt like she was my younger sister or something. We started getting involved in the same Twitter conversations - we have a lot in common; we’re both fascinated by the Snowdon revelations, Government surveillance, Wikileaks, Whistleblowing etc. Then she surprisingly invited me to this show - It’ll be an exciting night, it’ll be a “show what ya got baby” kinda night (laughs).</p>\n<p><strong>And that’s just before the release of A Deep Mysterious Tone right? Can you tell a little bit about that?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah so I’m interested in looking into the history of poetry from a female point of view. I think given that history is often talked about by men about men, it’s about time we started telling the other story as well. So I applied for a grant to do some poetry research, and I found the earliest female German poet ever recorded, from the 11th Century, as well as some more recent poets and cut their poems up with field recordings and noise and created this work called 'Gedichterbe’ in 2010. I got some really nice reactions from this and I really liked working in that way; I work so intensively with language and poetry in my own stuff anyway that I thought it would be nice to just look into different languages and cultures in the same way that I did with these German texts. So next I used the same technique with Finnish texts for 'Kuuntele’ in 2013; and my most recent record, 'A Deep Mysterious Tone’ is the same idea but with Japanese texts. It is becoming a series, digging into different languages from a feminist perspective. The next one is going to based on Russian texts.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4329/36024350526_76b9bfffc6_z.jpg\" alt=\"qw\"></p>\n<p><strong>Do you find there are certain creative freedoms that you can only access through working with other people’s texts in that way? For example with the Tujiko Noriko track there seems to be a lot expressed that you’d have difficulty saying in with music alone.</strong></p>\n<p>No it’s true – I probably wouldn’t have written that song by myself. Because I have this text which is like 100 years old I felt braver to use those words. Tujiko Noriko is singing it mainly, she’s singing ‘I am a new woman, I am the sun’ and it’s so touching. In a way it’s something so simple I would have never written it myself.</p>\n<p>But in terms of poetry, my work has a lot to do with my identity. I grew up in East Germany behind the wall and this has been one of the main themes in my solo work. Then through travelling the world I’ve acquired a Westernisation theme in my music, so from that point of view I’m on a personal level not so concerned about gender issues. I feel very confident about actually being a human. I’m not such a girl in a way - personally, you know? I am just insulted that things are not changing for my gender. So I do this activism not because I feel like a superwoman myself or something, I’m not that type. I don’t care personally so much about gender except for the fact I want a better life for my daughter and I want equality for my peers.</p>\n<p>In my work I’ve been more concerned about humanity and where my place is. For instance a regular topic of my work is the period after the wall came down in ‘89, which is around the same time the internet came about. For me that was kind of like my new country. I didn’t feel at home in this new Germany that came out of the fall of the wall. I didn’t feel I belonged there and it didn’t feel like my country, so for me it was always like I turned into a European citizen or a world citizen… Actually I would say that I feel stateless. Of course I am German and it’s my language and I love that language but I don’t feel at all connected to that country which is now Germany. Generally, nationality is overrated. I am pro-culture. I do think independently from nation, gender, race, religious beliefs; we need to develop new ethical sets of thinking and acting, and we need to unite to overthrow the dysfunctional forces at work.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/201522575&color=878787&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>I really feel like the Internet is an invisible web to be connected to what you choose to be connected to (which can of course also be very stupid and terrible) is a good thing. I grew up very restricted, without information, without truth, without transparency, without access to all kinds of things. Think North Korea, this is how I grew up – not as extreme but just about. For me that’s my theme; how much I enjoyed going into this new space which was the Internet and what became of it and where it is now. How Imperialism has been creeping into that space in the last 10 years… I’m concerned with machines and I love computers, my computer is my friend – that kind of stuff happens a lot in my work. It’s very personal poetry.</p>\n<p>I have a connection to code also – I have done a lot of music based on code language, I don’t know if you know that. Finding poetry in these things has been one of my big interests.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you record a lot of your own samples too?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh yeah - about 30% of my records are based in field recordings. I take a recorder around with me all the time. I’ve started using these recordings not so much as hardcore ‘sound art’ or whatever but to function in the same way that a kick drum might work in a club; using the environment I’m in to shape the music. I do this in an attempt to own the sound; so that I can say ‘this is my sound. I own that bass drum’ (laughs).</p>\n<p><strong>How did the ‘V I S I B I L I T Y’ blog come about and your involvement with ‘female:pressure’?</strong></p>\n<p>I did an <a href=\"https://medium.com/@poemproducer/some-things-just-must-be-said-simple-and-clear-there-is-a-lot-of-women-in-electronic-digital-d252f67a5b03\">article</a> that gives quite a comprehensive explanation of my involvement with female:pressure and why I did that. I also did this ‘Nerdgirls’ mix of over 100 female pioneers in electronic music, which still seems to be important. I was doing some work in this small Estonian town just last week with a curator who I wrote a book with, and he had the idea to get a really young girl to interview me. She said that she was really influenced by that Nerdgirls mix and that made me so happy, I was like “that can happen!”</p>\n<p>I guess I never really considered myself a Feminist until quite recently; I just thought ‘oh it will be fine’. But I lost my nerve a few years ago when I saw the lineup of this really big, publicly funded music festival that had just one woman on the entire bill. I was just like ‘what the fuck…’ This is taxed-money; contributed by women from society, and they make a festival with 99% guys? No way! So since then female:pressure has been collecting facts on labels and festivals and the first report was released in 2013. There was a public outcry on social media and the music press, and all the boys got defensive… it was quite interesting. Then in January Björk did that interview with Pitchfork saying how she felt as though she never got recognised as a producer, and that maybe the reason was that the public simply don’t see women in the studio. So I thought ‘hey let’s get some pictures together of women in studios for International Women’s Day’, and that’s how V I S I B I L I T Y came about.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/77513427&color=afadac&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>It feels like the blog is the final nail in the coffin for promoters who say there simply aren’t enough female producers to book for festivals.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah there’s really no excuse — it’s systematic. I get really aggressive about it, and I know that doesn’t make any friends. Even women on female:pressure were afraid to speak out with me because they thought they would get even fewer gigs than before, and they were scared, I understood that. But I was so pissed off I just thought, ‘I don’t need this. If they don’t book me, fuck them’. Now I’ve made more friends than enemies so that’s OK (laughs). I also wrote an email to all the curators, cultural organisers, and bookers that I know saying ‘listen: there’s no excuse anymore not to work gender-equal, 50/50. It is unacceptable to me that you don’t accept diversity’.</p>\n<p>It’s not just electronic musicians, either – that’s what I am part of but it’s representative of all the other parts in society except for very hardcore jobs like being a nurse or something. Anything which has good pay and respect in society has women as underdogs, so they have to reinvent themselves every day. I find it interesting at the same time to look at all these different women and how they are doing this. Look at all those female grime MCs in the UK – RoxXxan or No Lay for instance. I’m listening to all of these women and how they find their voices in male dominated genres.</p>\n<p>I’ve been talking to people in architecture and they’ve been saying exactly the same thing – you could make the same blog about women in architecture. The men get the jobs and the women are doing the same jobs for less pay, or they’re not invited to conferences or don’t get the credits and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>I suppose part of the reason why the blog is so effective is that the world of engineering and electronics itself is so male dominated, so it’s really powerful to see those stereotypes reversed.</strong></p>\n<p>Exactly - like most of the instruments, the software, the gear is all made by men. There is such an ancient history that goes behind why women aren’t as present in electronic music. The biggest argument I got from men about my stance was that ‘well, there are simply more men in the industry, why do you want 50/50?’ And I can see that the male white producer is scared and upset by this prospect, I get that. But I think it would be a great evolutionary step to put it this way and start from zero and see where this leads. As long as we keep telling the story the way it’s told now, it’s never going to fucking change.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally, what plans have you got for the rest of the year?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m working hard on my next solo record at the moment - I can’t say too much about it right now but I want it to be absolutely amazing… which is really hard because I have released so many albums and I’m trying to find a voice again and make something meaningful. I’m also working with a cultural organisation that I founded four years ago in Finland, and a media lab in this little village, and public sound workshops… I want to put out this message that although we live on the remote edge of the world, it’s still means we can be doing super-dope stuff here! We also invited artists over for a residency doing acoustic sculpture, installations, happenings, we made a protest boat trip with a local fisherman where we had the Japanese sound artists Ryoko Akama playing to the ocean to prevent the building a nuclear power plant. I’ve also been invited to do several sound camps with students and artists coming over, we made a sound app called ‘Sound Map Hailuoto’ which looks like a map of our island and you can listen to our island’s sonic environment, and we’ve also been developing sonic bikes with Kaffe Matthews for the tourists in the summer.</p>\n<p>You can strem AGF’s latest release, <a href=\"https://agf-poemproducer.bandcamp.com/album/a-deep-mysterious-tone\">‘A Deep Mysterious Tone’</a> below.

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> Fullfridge Music\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> CD/Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 19/05/15</p>\n<p>Fullfridge Music have been in existence since 2011, their location in the south of France never deterring founder Cloudnumber from bringing producers from around the globe on board with the project. The latest release, <em>Classics From The Bluweirdo</em>, pulls many of these artists together on one complete work, showcasing the label’s most avante-garde tendencies.</p>\n<p>The album has been constructed how one might approach a mix, building from oddball, Radiophonic Workshop style experiments such as Lokom’s ‘Chantal’, or Hasan Hujairi’s deliriously fragmented sampling on ‘How To Be Good and Complacent’. The turning point comes in the closing minutes of ‘Titre’, a crumbling mix of Eastern vocals, warbling synthesisers and thickset drumming from Egyptian composer Ahmed Saleh.</p>\n<p>For the latter half of the release, the imprint’s inclination for frantic, broken-beat rhythms is brought into focus. The clattering, Pearson Sound reminiscent drums of Bombé’s ‘Indo’, or A Taut Line’s grime-spattered musing, 'Warned Off’ both make good examples.</p>\n<p>There is a mix of old and new faces across the LP; Lindus Phrasen aka HGLDT turns in the joyously noisy ‘Reutrn’, whilst Shinigami San recasts ‘Broken TV’ by previous Fullfridge signees The Uncowl, crafting the track into a sleek, twisted-electro weapon.</p>\n<p>The Grenoble based label have been growing steadily over their four year lifespan; their graduation to the vinyl format late last year also indicating a stylistic shift. <em>Classics From The Bluweirdo</em> provides a fitting mission statement as to exactly what this altered direction might be; needless to say we like it a lot.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/byfpmFJMt8E?rel=0&controls=0&showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Peder Mannerfelt’s releases have never been short of artistry. His most recent project is one of the most daring yet; a reconstruction of <em>The Belgian Congo Records</em> entirely using synthesisers. The original is a series of recordings of Congolese music coordinated by filmmaker Armand Denis and first published in the 1950s. Mannerfelt’s re-imagining, however, is entitled <em>The Swedish Congo Record</em> and has been released via Yves De Mey Peter Van Hoesen’s ‘Archives Intérieures’ imprint.</p>\n<p>Through his electronic rework of the original compilation, Mannerfelt has presented a vivid, highly imaginative work. By keeping the original titles and giving full disclosure to its context, he pays honest tribute to the originals rather than seeking to exploit or misinterpret them. The LP shines a stark spotlight on a rarely highlighted period of colonialism and invites us to reconsider a period of ruthless exploitation.</p>\n<p>In light of this release, we decided to invite Mannerfelt to contribute to our That Time When series, discussing five of his most memorable gigging experiences. The results are just as eclectic as you might expect.</p>\n<p>##1 Fireside_1996\n<img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8844/18742156656_179b18fe03_z.jpg\" alt=\"Fireside_1996\">\n<em>The</em> defining gig of my youth. Refused were my main obsession for a few years in my teens. After they released <em>Songs To Fan The Flames Of Discontent</em> (their best album in my opinion) they did a tour together with Fireside and Entombed, two other of the most important Swedish bands from the 90s. I was lucky enough to catch them when they played in Stockholm, even though it was a school night.</p>\n<p>##2 <strong>Unknown_2013</strong>\n<img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8833/18580735628_752e6e70ef_z.jpg\" alt=\"Meshuggah_2008_Melbourne_2\">\nMassive and out of this world. The coolest thing about Meshuggah is that they somehow appeal to every kind of metal fan, from crust-punks to glam rockers. I saw them for the first time two years ago. I broke a rib in the mosh pit during ‘Bleed’. Unfortunately I had promised my girlfriend to dig a flowerbed the day after, nothing I would recommend doing with a broken rib.</p>\n<p>##3 <strong>Unknown_2007</strong>\n<img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8859/18768917625_5f1ab7535b_z.jpg\" alt=\"Matt_Hoopes_and_Matt_Thiessen_at_Sonar_Baltimore_May_2007\">\nIt´s always difficult when you go see a band that you loved in your teens 10 years later, but hearing ”Deathbed&quot; live for the first time made me feel like I was 15 years old again.</p>\n<p>##4 <strong>Butlins_2011</strong>\n<img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/540/18742680476_a0d12e4abd_z.jpg\" alt=\"Theo\">\nI’m not that into watching a DJ ”DJ”, but seeing Theo Parrish transforming an empty room on a Sunday night at ATP into a frenzy with basically the whole festival dropping in one by one, looping up James Browns ”Funky Good Time” (probably the cheesiest JB track ever) for what felt like at least 30 min is nothing short of a master at work.</p>\n<p>##5 <strong>Unknown_Various</strong>\n<img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/308/18769048455_63ef11c1cc_z.jpg\" alt=\"background_10\">\nYou don´t go <em>see</em> Sunn O))), you experience it with your whole body. For the first 45 minutes or so your entire being screams for mercy and your only instinct is to flee. If you endure that and surrender to the volume and sheer sound pressure it will become a truly transcending event. Kind of like being in a really hot sauna for a few hours.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=20277492/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless>[The Swedish Congo Record by Peder Mannerfelt](http://archivesinterieures.bandcamp.com/album/the-swedish-congo-record)</iframe>",

This is the site of the latest release from Michael Fahres. Recorded at the foot of the mountain, Fahres’ <em>Tibataje</em> LP is a labyrinth of tessellating percussive grooves, played on traditional El Hierro wooden drums and later electronically manipulated by Fahres in the studio.</p>\n<p>The mountain is said to possess distinctive percussive qualities. Every sound that hits the face of the rock is imitated back to the world, in a strange form of call-and-response. The album aims to hone in on this effect; “aggrandising, clarifying, changing and uncovering the specific characteristics of the mountain using music as its means.” This LP marks something of a departure for Fahres, as most will know him for his electronic experiments dating back to the 70s. The result is a recording as eerily still as the mountain itself, with a kind of quiet-before-the-storm uneasiness about it. At points there is nothing but the sporadic dry thud of the drums. At others, we are left with only the soft hums of the wind laying dormant in the backdrop.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that only three drummers are present in the entire recording, it can often sound as if an complete ensemble are playing at you with full blare, smothering the entire stereo field in an immense web of polyrhythmic power. You can hear the off-kilter echoes of the mountain, exploring the terrain’s sonic possibilities and presenting them within a new creative context. The album’s closer, ‘Davor’ is perhaps the most estranging in this regard. Ambient pads, alarm clocks and glottal oboes creep into the mix, blurring the line between the real and the imaginary at the very last stretch of the piece.</p>\n<iframe style=\"width: 100%; height: 241px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=722773799/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless>[Tibataje lp by Michael Fahres](http://testtoon.bandcamp.com/album/tibataje-lp)</iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Mike Gervais has managed to facilitate a rich network of producers and DJs across an impressive 15 year career. “I’m always working to maintain a balance between family, friends, health, promoting, producing, performing, and on and on and on” he begins when we spoke to him about his work earlier this month. “My recent focus has been split between re-establishing our SYSTEM nights at First Avenue (of Prince/Purple Rain fame), adjusting to life without a laptop in the DJ booth, and riding the never-ending ups and downs in the studio”.</p>\n<p>Gervais can also boast of two labels under his belt; SYSTEM and the now discontinued Timefog. “Long story short: Timefog was run by a few of my very close friends and myself. Three of the five members moved to different cities all over the world and some creative differences started to show. It was frustrating to see it crumble right when some real momentum started but that's just how things go sometimes,” he reflects. “SYSTEM was created as the logical next effort to Timefog. It's not like I was just going to stop doing what I've been doing for the last two decades. I couldn't stop even if I wanted to. We're looking forward to expanding the brand into everything from low quality energy drinks, to $5 ear buds found at gas stations and tween outlet stores, to whatever that thing Flo Rida was pushing… Really shove the brand in everyone's faces you know? I'm kidding obviously.”</p>\n<p>His club-nights have garnered particular attention too, especially through their affiliation with Zak Khutoretsky, aka DVS1, with whom Gervais has worked with extensively with over the years. “I first met Zak in ‘97 through friends and Minneapolis parties and all that.” He explains. “Actually he was my first influence when I was looking to step out of the crowd and into the DJ booth (for obvious reasons). He's still a major influence for me today. The scene in Minneapolis... it's been explained by people more eloquent than myself many times but to sum it up into one word would be: struggle. There's so many factors pushing against us like the 2am bar closing time, the even worse 2am business closing time (aka no legal framework to have a legit after-hours venue), the fact we are a flyover state and there's only about 300 real techno fans in the area, isolation from other major/minor cities (five hours to Milwaukee, six hours to Chicago, five to Cedar Rapids, six to Winnipeg, eleven to Detroit, etc..), not having any clubs setup for this music so we're forced to retrofit rock venues with additional sound/lighting/gear at every event, door/cover splits with venues making events more expensive to run compared to other cities, lack of usable underground locations, and the list goes on. Just finding a venue that will be willing to host this kind of event are difficult to find.”</p>\n<p>The nights that Gervais hosts through SYSTEM are some of the few that can still function in these choppy waters. “We have headliners come through but it's not on a weekly basis. On the flip side, the promoters who find their way through it are really in it for the right reasons (and it's never a big payday). The crowds and dance floors are some of the best I've experienced anywhere. Packed with smart listeners who aren't just on the sidelines stroking their chins and trying to catch a glimpse of what that track you just played was. Engaging people with great energy all the time. When an event hits, it REALLY hits. Zak has said many times this city builds a certain character and I couldn't agree with him more. I'm proud to call Minneapolis my home.”</p>\n<p>This year, his Assailant EP sedimented his credentials as a producer firmly into the foundations of modern techno. You can hear his rich background in the scene throughout the EP, which combines intricate pockets of harmony with tough sound system physicality. In light of this release, Gervais has kindly put together a mix for the latest instalment of our podcast series.

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> Semantica Records\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> 2X12”/CD/Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 22/06/2015</p>\n<p>Better known by her moniker Cio D'or, Cologne based Cio Dorbandt has been a prolific and diverse figure in the world of experimental electronica. With two albums, 10 solo EPs, and three EPs co-produced with the likes of Donato Dozzy, Gabriel Ananda and Paul Brtschitsch, her output has continually shifted in style. Her latest release, entitled <i>All in All</i>, comes from Sverca’s Semantica imprint, and marks yet another change in approach. Earlier this year, we were treated to ‘Off and On’, a silk-spun dub/ambient 12&quot; that hinted at brooding, unspoken moods. This time however, Dorbandt makes no effort to hide the darker tendencies in her aesthetic.</p>\n<p>The LP is crammed with shepard-tone synths and ticking 808 percussion, not to mention an omnipresent sub, reaching unfathomable depths at points. Opener 'After And Before’ gives us a glimpse of things to come before the album has fully begun, as a discordant string motif gives way to reveal chasms of bass in the track’s closing seconds. 'Tomorrow Was Yesterday’ begins with the same sense of lurking menace, before slowly peaking above the clouds in the track's final section. Transitioning to rousing orchestral timbres amid Dorbandt's gum-stuck kicks and vaporous high-end, the track makes a fitting indicator of the contrast found across the rest of the LP. The trembling strings and dulcet tone keys of 'Now and Then' are case in point; feeling oddly at ease alongside puncturing bass and grumbling atmospherics.</p>\n<p>Dorbandt's work has always had an expansive feel to it, perhaps highlighted by the aforementioned breadth of her output. Here for example, despite the undercurrent of paranoia; there is also a thrill in exploring the uncharted. They feature fairly frequently, but the way in which she places tremoring orchestral timbres within clinical early-hours techno feels refreshingly unfamiliar.</p>\n<p>As the LP progresses, things become progressively more abstract. From the Deep Medi-style sway of 'Hecto’ to 'Yotta’s carousel of buoyant low-end and hissing percussion. Perhaps signified by their similar titles, the final tracks almost seem to merge into one, 'Yocta’ sounds like a languid cousin of its predecessor. The track glides deftly; like some dead eyed sea-floor inhabitant snaking through the depths. 'Zepto’ closes the LP with even deeper ventures; electrical purring, plodding kicks and warbling metallic soundscapes.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1466511375/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://semanticarecords.bandcamp.com/album/cio-dor-all-in-all-semantica-73\">Cio D&#39;Or - all in all.

    "content": "<p>The work of the Oliver Peryman, better known by his Fis moniker, never ceases to evade description. With a rich background in D&amp;B and techno, there are undeniable tendencies towards beat-oriented music present in the sound. However, to only focus on these would be to misdescribe Fis entirely. There is something more mystical and elemental at work throughout his work, and his music takes clear inspirational cues from nature.</p>\n<p>However, unlike  the field recordings of say, Wolfgang Voigt or Fennesz, Peryman’s work doesn’t so much replicate nature, as mimic it. The naturalistic motifs are there, but re-realised through computer-mediated software and hyperengineered effects. His latest album, <em>The Blue Quicksand is Going Now</em> brings this phenomenon to the fore, twisting and contorting textures in novel and innovative ways. We hear flutters of tremolo that sound like a flock of birds taking flight, gravely subs that lap around the stereo field like a diving whale and the thick churning of dense undergrowth. It’s a complex and considered record, and one that cannot be fully absorbed with just surface listening. In light of this release, we decided to catch up with Peryman to talk nation, permaculture and Alice Coltrane.</p>\n<p><strong>How have things been this last year? What have you been up to?</strong></p>\n<p>Things have been really good thanks. Just had a great summer at home in NZ, working day jobs, finishing the album and writing more stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m looking forward to your Berlin Atonal set this year. It must have been daunting to follow Cabaret Voltaire in 2014! What have you got planned this time around?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m looking forward to it too. Atonal was a definite highlight of last year for me. Such a dope festival. If anything, following Cabaret Voltaire actually took the pressure off, it was a perfect chance to work outside the spotlight and step in from there. As for this year, Jovan is pushing himself on the visual side as always, it’s inspiring to see how rapidly he develops his stuff, it makes me want to push things too. It's looking like we’ll offer a progression on last year…</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/206513256&color=ababab&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I remember that there was a surprising amount of (what sounded like) naturalistic samples in your set at Atonal last year: wind, rain, running water and so on. I can hear a lot of this in your new album, but with some grittier, metallic elements in the sound, too. What has changed in your taste since last summer? What are you listening to at the moment?</strong></p>\n<p>I don’t actually listen to much music at all, nor do I have a big knowledge about it. I rely on friends to share what they’re into, which is nice in a way. Lately, if I do put stuff on it’s been Alice Coltrane. She was a genius. I’ve been liking lots of classical too. Someone passed me the Aiki, Lowe, Kalma release on RVNG recently, been loving that. All good stuff to learn from. As for my own work I think it’s leading/following me through some big shifts, there might not be as much ‘harsh noise’ anymore, that was coming from some pretty unhealthy energies in my system, that’s fine but it’s also nice to feel everything balancing out. I wouldn’t be surprised if an elemental influence remains, that’s a big part of my life and where I’m from.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us something about the Loopy imprint that this album has released on? What, if any, is the 'ethos’ of the label? Are there any future plans for it?</strong></p>\n<p>There are certainly future plans but that’s for the label to reveal. The same goes for any kind of 'ethos’; that’ll get clearer as time goes by. I do feel ‘Loopy’s becoming something really valuable and well worth following, if my own experiences are anything to go by they’ll relate well with people and get their best efforts in return…</p>\n<p><strong>You’ve said in the past that making music for you is more of a bodily experience than one of cognition or language, that you feel the progress of a track through the torso rather than the mind. Do you think the heavy emphasis placed on dance in D&amp;B has influenced you in this regard?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah it will have done originally if not so much anymore, I used to study stuff from Consequence (who also mentored/supported me when I was starting out), and Photek’s earlier stuff too. Both of their outputs always sounded like an actual physical thing in the room. I’d say the wider soundsystem music traditions have been influential in this respect too. New Zealand has a strong soundsystem culture of its own, mostly very strong DIY handbuilds, I’d say that’s where my appreciation for low frequencies came from, especially the outdoor raves in NZ. I’m yet to play on better systems overseas to be honest, which is why I’m building one of my own in Europe. I won’t be returning or running away from D&amp;B I guess. I don’t know, I’m just thinking about other things at the moment…</p>\n<p><strong>I especially like the artwork for Tri Angle, and I understand that those were your own creations. Is the artwork that accompanies your music important to you?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s not hugely important but it’s always a pleasant part of the release process. It comes after a tracklisting has been finalised and you start to feel a record is making its way into the world. I love that Tri Angle let me do those artworks. They were both such effortless releases for us actually. Robin just let me play around with shit and everything fell into place. I use the drawings more as a way of understanding the essence of each track or releases as a whole. The artwork for my new record is actually a hand-drawn work done by Brian DeGraw. Loopy sourced that and I really dig it. The whole thing holds its place peacefully with the music. I work from the belief that sound and light are one in the same.</p>\n<p>I’m not really influenced by film or specific films per se, not knowingly or intentionally anyway. But soundtracking is something that seems to crop up around my work. There are some avenues coming into view for me there that are really exciting. I don’t know a lot about visual arts either, if anything the drawings that I did for Triangle are influenced by illustrations I see in Biodynamics and Permaculture reading...</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://s86.photobucket.com/user/georgemc25/media/bab1164c-0106-48d0-9b70-450b8b2f79f2_zpsi35v52tu.jpg.html\"><img src=\"http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k114/georgemc25/bab1164c-0106-48d0-9b70-450b8b2f79f2_zpsi35v52tu.jpg\" alt=\" photo bab1164c-0106-48d0-9b70-450b8b2f79f2_zpsi35v52tu.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>What exactly is your connection to permaculture?</strong></p>\n<p>Hard to say where my connection to permaculture started. I come from a pretty typical hippy Pakeha family in NZ; my father has grown food at home and made me and my brothers help as long as I can remember. I didn't really know 'organic food' was a thing until I got older. We just called that 'food'. I guess when you just like people and you like plants and animals you want to do something that looks after them. Permaculture is a really useful tool in that regard. I'm excited to be talking with a venue in Berlin about putting their site through a permaculture renovation, and by the looks of the site this should result in some edible gardens and forest orchards. Every ecologically successful community has used art and music to store wisdom about the workings of nature. Electronic music can start re-integrating with our source too, and I hope to make a contribution in that way.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196802355&color=a4a19f&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Is it true that your debut European show was last year? How did it go if so? Do you think your fan base is mostly based in New Zealand or here in Europe? Is it weird to have a fan-base on the other side of the world?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes that’s true, in Brussels. It was my debut live-set anywhere and it was a bit rough round the edges, so I'm probably not expecting a second date there!! It was a good chance to learn and move on and I'm quite happy with where things are at in the live sense now. There seems to be an even balance between NZ and elsewhere. Something pretty uncanny is going on around the music though, especially with people overseas, we’re meeting each other for the first time but having a strange sense of knowing each other really well already. It’s as if the music’s been a table we’re sitting around chatting to each other without ever really knowing it. I hope that carries on as some fantastic relationships have cropped up lately.</p>\n<p>I wouldn’t deny that there is an element of ‘Britishness’ or ‘European sound’ present in my music if people wanted to make that association. I have European ancestry so of course it’s not a big leap either, but it’s hard to put my finger on anything detailed there, my priority so far has just been learning my own craft and trying to develop things internally…</p>\n<p><strong>I’m interested to hear your thoughts on colonialism in music, particularly in New Zealand. What did you think, for example, about British label Livity Sound’s appropriation of Māori imagery in their artwork?</strong></p>\n<p>The academic who spoke up about it is a friend of a friend (typical NZ!). I think he had every right to be concerned, but to me that issue is primarily between him and Livity Sound. I’m not sure how their conversations went, hopefully restorative for everyone involved… I’m no expert but I would say that colonialism, like any other variation of bullshit, will only operate as long as people have parts of themselves for it to latch onto and work through. In my opinion it just means people (especially those from dominant cultures - which includes me) have a responsibility to heal the parts of themselves that harmful systems feed off, give it nothing to hold onto in other words.</p>\n<p>That means we need an environment where people can be open and honest about where they need to grow, but nobody can do that while so many people are waiting to say a big fuck-you to anyone who stuffs up. It’s no wonder people get defensive after getting called-out when there’s no room for error. The irony is leaning in like that is just as symptomatic of the problem as anything else, and in the end I thin it’s anti-growth. It’s important to speak up when shit’s not good enough, but that’s got to go hand in hand with a higher purpose of supporting each other into our better nature. When it comes to appropriation I think that has something to do with contentedness in your own space and learning how to honour the people/things we meet in our lives.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally, are there any other exciting projects coming up that you can tell us about? What else does 2015 hold for you?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes! There are more releases coming after the album. I have some shows to do in Europe too. Also my music will slowly become more integrated with other work I do in my life around permaculture design/biodynamic agriculture. I’ll do this work as Fis, so expect to see some 'Fis’ projects that don’t actually involve music as directly as before!</p>\n<p><em>'The Blue Quicksand Is Going Now' will be released on June 29th'</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/106399343&color=a4a4a4&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> Haunter Records\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> 12”/Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 29/06/2015</p>\n<p>Haunter Records have a good thing going with Italian modular obsessive Giovanni Napoli, aka Somec. Having signed his debut EP ‘Arbitrary Function Generator’ totally out of the blue, there’s been just a couple of months break before Napoli’s follow-up EP, 'Source Of Uncertainty’ has hit the label. Everything about the release sounds broken and generally dishevilled, yet this is all part of the appeal with Somec - he is a self-confessed lover of using battered old analog hardware.</p>\n<p>Most of the offerings begin timidly: the result of careful programming and meticulous attention to detail. Yet as they progress, Napoli’s network of machines seem to wrestle free from their constraints, trampling their own path in a haze of bitcrush and crackled dialtones. The rough trod 'MD Discount’ or 'Drone DPO’s gritten, downcast synthesisers and rambling tin pan drums both make good examples of this, twitching bleeps and modem glitches spattering the mix in loose, off-kilter placements.</p>\n<p>For a record so clearly unconcerned by it’s dancefloor functionality it is odd to hear the traits of rave and electro bleed through. Swollen bass-lines, discordant synths and skittering, technoid percussion sound heavily tape-saturated; their rhythms never consistent enough to be considered dancefloor friendly. 'Skan’s stop-cut synthplay is testament to this, occasionally falling into a regular groove before sinking back to meandering dreamscapes. The bug-eyed 'Incertezza’ is a further case in point, bumping forward in a disengaged, lethargic fashion.</p>\n<p>Few producers are able to deliver something so lo-fi in such an well-produced manner; Napoli’s experiments feel both considered and at the same time randomised and freeform. There is an almost krautrock-ish psychedelia at play here, akin to a producer like Dead Fader or Ekoplekz. Where he will tread next remains unclear, however Haunter have provided a fitting home for Somec material thus far. Just don’t stop fucking with machines Napoli.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/115194394&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> VENT Records\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> 12”\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 22/06/2015</p>\n<p>Rightly or wrongly, I have always viewed Vent - a label based between Istanbul and Stockholm, as a rather functional affair. Their most recent contribution, Stephanie Sykes' 'Black Simulation' EP however, is inviting me to reconsider. The release undoubtedly has its roots in dancefloor genres, yet also displays a more than cursory interest in noise, drone and ambient textures. Crawling title piece 'Black Simulation' is perhaps the most overt example; a shimmering static hum remains omnipresent through the track's distorted croaks and crystalline low-end. There is something glacial about the soundscape presented here, the occassional haunting, synthetic whistle hinting at life in an otherwise uninhabited space.</p>\n<p>Following this, the morose 'Creep' skitters to a fro amidst a tranquilised low-end, whilst 'Hyper' on the one hand utilises thundering breakbeat percussion and on the other droning atmospherics. The contrast is jarring to say the least - whilst snare drums smack into place with bone-shattering force, warbling UFO soundscapes glide with dull serenity in the backdrop.</p>\n<p>Closing the EP Russian producer Dasha Rush turns in a chugging, gritten recast of the original. Rush has garnered significant attention as of late for the nebulous avante-garde electronica that comprised her Raster Noton debut, <em>Sleepsteps</em>, yet here she deploys spartan tactics. Twitching hats and hack-saw basslines march forward solemnly alongside Sykes' familiarly detached atmospherics - one of the only remaining hallmarks of the original.</p>\n<p>As her debut solo EP, 'Black Simulation' is a bold move in its variation in textures. Sykes has managed to present a release which incorporates drone, squelching acid, techno and power-drill breakbeat without compromising on her sound - her adaptability shows all the hallmarks of longevity. Needless to say this spells good things for the future.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/114057948&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Swedish artist Andreas Tilliander has had no shortage of projects of the years. Since the turn of the millennium he has been conjuring up new monikers like they're going out of fashion; Mokira, TM404, Lowfour, Komp, Svaag and Rechord are just a number of his assorted aliases, each displaying a different of Tilliander's angles on dub-heavy electronica and minimal-leaning hardware techno.</p>\n<p>One such project to be brought back to life recently has been Kondens - a collaborative effort with Stefan Thor. The first release from the project since 2011 emerged on Börft Records' Soundcloud page last month, and it has recently transpired that a second 12&quot; will be released via Ulf Eriksson's Kontra Musik additionally. With this, alongside a new mix CD for Enter.Ibizia due out imminently, we decided to catch up with Tilliander to discuss the project, veganism, and his first meeting with Kontra label boss Ulf Eriksson.</p>\n<p><strong>Hi Andreas how are things?  You got back from Japan recently - what were you up to over there?</strong></p>\n<p>Hello there. I’ve just returned from a month in Japan - I believe it was my tenth time in the best country that I can think of. I stayed for an entire month, but it was still hard to leave. Once when leaving Tokyo, I burst into tears on the plane. It was close this time too, but I managed to keep a straight face and kept my cool!</p>\n<p>The main reason for staying one month was to do field recordings and make music with my partner Elin Franzén. We got some fantastic art funding from Sweden and the result will hopefully be an album in 2016 or so. While in Tokyo, I also interviewed some artists for my radio show, and I even had the time to do a few gigs too.</p>\n<p><strong>I believe I'm right in saying you're a fellow vegan - what's it like food-wise over there? When did you make the decision to become vegan in the first place too?</strong></p>\n<p>Nowadays it’s super easy to be vegan in Japan! We were eating at different restaurants almost every night and I have to say that none of them were disappointing. In 2001, I was in Japan for the first time. Back then it was difficult finding any vegan food at all and I mostly ate fruits, crisps and rice really. Nowadays, I have lots of friends in Tokyo, but mainly I rely on apps and websites like the excellent Happy Cow, which is a place where you can find vegan or vegetarian restaurants almost anywhere. Tokyo is no exception. In fact, I think that Stockholm is harder. Stockholm, the city I’ve lived in since the late nineties, is trying to act like it’s a big city with lots of everything for everyone and still there’s only one vegan restaurant in the entire town. Shame on you, the “Capital of Scandinavia”!</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/205094921&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>You have a new release under the name Kondens alongside Stefan Thor this month which will be the first one from the project since 2011. How did you first meet Stefan and what sparked the return to the project?</strong></p>\n<p>We met when we were, or at least I was, very young. He’s about four of five years older (I never figured out exactly) and he was studying art at a local school in the tiny town of Hässleholm where I grew up. Apparently, the school’s kitchen caught fire one day so they all had to eat at my elementary school. Stefan was dressed in black and wore Dr. Martens. I was twelve and super impressed to meet somebody that had the same outfit as I. I remember approaching him and deliberately stepping on his shoes while asking if he was going to come to the industrial concert at the local youth club next Saturday. He replied in a cool way that he and his mate were the ones performing. I got very impressed and I even bought a t-shirt on the spot. So at the concert, There were three people wearing the same shirt - the band on stage and me.</p>\n<p>Stefan and I have been close friends ever since and we’ve made music together since the nineties or so, but just as a way of hanging out really. Other people sit on a sofa and get drunk. Stefan and I connect our synths and drum machines, mix some drinks, talk about life and art and record at the same time. Just like most people in Skåne, the southernmost part of Sweden, Stefan often takes his car and goes to Germany to harvest looooads of alcoholic beverages. So every time we meet, he makes rum drinks for us. Sometimes a bit too many though. We have no rules whatsoever, apart from having fun and making something that is slightly weird yet with a swing. We put out two vinyls on the dear label Kontra-Musik and got remixed by my old idol Substance from Chain Reaction as well as the very talented and fun Berghain resident Norman Nodge. Following that, we did some gigs but mostly ended up playing at house clubs, so what we did was perhaps a bit too strange.</p>\n<p>Stefan had a second kid and I started working on my TM404 project, so things were put on halt for some years. The reason we returned to the project now is that we have about two hours of decent recordings and I guess it would be a shame to just let it sit on those tapes and rot.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/180088864&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>You also returned to your Mokira alias recently, releasing an EP with Swedish label S.E.L.F. You mentioned the tracks are 7-8 years old in an earlier email - how did they come to be passed on to the label? Is Mokira something you're going to be carrying on with?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. Those tracks were recorded for another label actually. But after about two years of waiting for the music to be released, I decided not to release it at all. Then the S.E.L.F people contacted me for some material and I sent them three different ideas. They liked those old recordings, and frankly I’m not even sure I told them that the material is that old. Perhaps they will read this and weep, hehe. There’s a live clip from when I played in Belgium in 2009, where I’m playing that material.</p>\n<p>Mokira is taking a timeout, like most of my monikers apart from TM404 at the moment, but I think Mokira is the project that I’ve released the most records with, from the debut on Raster-Noton in 2000 to this years S.E.L.F vinyl. It’s been a long time, but I have to say I’m still proud of all those releases, which I really can’t say about everything I’ve released.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/406/19588756541_78069f1f7c_b.jpg\" alt=\"andreas-tilliander\"></p>\n<p><strong>You've released a fair amount of your music via Kontra. Ulf Eriksson once told me an in an interview the story of how you first met - he said you turned up drunk and fell asleep at a party he booked you to play at, and that you've been friends ever since! Do you remember the time as well? What do you think it is about Kontra that makes such a fitting home for your work?</strong></p>\n<p>Ulf and I were just speaking about that. He was actually in Tokyo a few days when I was there. I’m responsible for being the person with the most releases on Kontra-Musik which I’m very proud of, considering the truly amazing records he puts out. It’s true that the first time we met, more than ten years ago, wasn’t optional. I was doing a daytime session at a festival in Malmö and there’s pictures of me having a bottle of red wine by myself during the set. That’s not a good breakfast if you’re also booked to play at a rave in the forest about twelve hours later! I grew up in the south of Sweden, but I've Iived in Stockholm since I finished school, so every time I return to the south I try to meet up with old friends. And that sometimes involves drinking too. I remembering being at the venue but feeling too tired to perform with the trio I had at the time with Mikael Stavöstrand and Johan Skugge. We were called Bulgur Brothers and while the other two brothers were on stage performing, I was in the backstage area on a sofa waking up every now and then thinking to myself “Oh, that sounds great! Hope it’s us performing right now!” It’s a fun memory, but it’s also an isolated incident. Never again did I get too wasted to perform. Which is perhaps a good thing, otherwise I’d have to release on so many labels.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of the Swedish scene - I believe I'm right in saying you master the releases for Finn Albertsson's Sonuos imprint. How did this come about? Is mastering something you have always done or something you've got into fairly recently?</strong></p>\n<p>That’s correct. Fun fact - When I was 15 years old, I had a local radio show about strange electronic music and I interviewed the much older Finn. Well, at least in those days he was much older. Since I’m considered a grownup too nowadays, it feels as if we’re the same age more or less. Anyway, I was a fan of his music 25 years ago and he has the most perfect taste in music so how could I turn down a request from him? I even did a Mokira remix for one of his releases.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/88653685?color=ffffff&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"570\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>I’ve mastered since the late nineties and there’s been a few hundred records that have been through my compressors and EQ’s in the studio. Recently, I’ve been too busy doing my own productions so I tend only to accept a mastering job when I really dig the music. More or less, I only master the releases for Börft Records at the moment since I love everything they release.</p>\n<p><strong>It states on your website that 'Repeatle will soon be back' - exciting news! I picked up a copy of the 'Stay Down' 12&quot; a few months back which is absolutely stunning. Anything more you can tell us about the future plans for Repeatle?</strong></p>\n<p>Great to hear! Repeatle as a label did three dubby vinyls back in 2007. Since then, the label has been silent. There’s a 12” I released in 2001 on the fantastic German label Force Inc called Repeatle. This and some other of my old records will be remastered and released digitally through Repeatle during 2015, whenever I find the time. Apart from that, nothing is planned for my own label. But if a decent vinyl distributor reads this and gets the vibes, hit me up and we’ll see.</p>\n<p><strong>What else can we expect to hear from yourself over the coming months? Any interesting projects in the the works over the rest of 2015?</strong></p>\n<p>2015 will probably be yet another year of recording for me. I have about three hours of unreleased TM404 material and when I have five hours, I’ll compile it into an album or something. I’m too fond of working in the studio, so I have a hard time actually finishing my sessions if nobody forces me too. I play live almost every weekend, so if you’ve seen me live, you’ve probably heard in which direction I’m heading. TM404 aside, I’ll release the Kondens 12” on Börft that you mentioned earlier and there will also be another Tilliander vinyl on Börft before we hit 2016. I’m doing a mix CD for Richie Hawtin and his Minus label to be released as part of the ENTER.Ibiza nights where I’ll be playing for the third summer in a row. It’s a great summer job and I love Richie, the fantastic crew and everything connected to the possibility of playing somewhat weird electronics to the Ibiza crowd. Ibiza is so much more than just Avichii, Swedish Mafia House, Steve Aiko, Deadmau6, Hardwall and so on.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/161647530&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Label:</strong> Self-released\n<br><strong>Format:</strong> Digital\n<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 11/07/15</p>\n<p>Five years ago, Robert T was working as an air traffic controller in New Brunswick. Following what he described in an interview with Thump as being “the most stressful job in the world”, he took stress leave, unexpectedly finding solace and occupation in the old synths and hardware he had grown up with. This kind of spontaneous creativity, seemingly out of thin air, was once described by Sasu Ripatti when musing on the recording process for 2014’s masterful <em>Visa</em>; “a valve broke open…”, he wrote, “and I collected what came out the pipes.” Indeed, T’s latest EP, <em>Seraph</em>, seems to also contain some of this mysterious creative energy; recorded in one live take inside a church.</p>\n<p>The spiritual setting of the record should not be dismissed. The church itself possesses rich, natural reverbs, which T uses to brilliant effect. It also gives us an insight into the conceptual and sonic framework for the record; T has named the record after an enigmatic angelic body and he later described the process of recording the record as “literally shaking the stained glass”. This should really come as no surprise, as sub-frequencies pulse incessantly through the release, and T’s hardware generated soundscapes seems to fill every iota of space, mounting to almost unbearable levels of pressure.</p>\n<p>A clear highlight is the EP’s closer, ‘Seraph IV’, which marries the metallic sheen of Helm with the puzzling ambient abstractions of Oubys and others on the Testoon roster. As the static echo loops of the final few seconds steadily recede, there is a sense of incompleteness left at the conclusion of the record. This is not a new musical manifesto for T, but rather the reawakening of a sound long left dormant.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1692943754/size=small/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/artwork=none/transparent=true/\" seamless>[Seraph by Robert T](http://robertt.bandcamp.com/album/seraph)</iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p>I first became aware of CEP2plet via my favorite Youtube channel, Chookiessss. The brazen chiptune tones of ‘Grand Upper’ were ridiculous to the point of humour, and yet undeniably compelling. A few days later, I found that comments had been left on my tracks by CEP2plet himself, made entirely of code. ‘347...I.$...|*.|2.|.|\\/|.[-...’ read one. ‘|3./\\.|)...|3.().}{.[-.|2...’ read another. It was at this point that I had something of a ‘wake up Neo…’ feeling; was I being communicated to by an extra-terrestrial computer or is this some weird prank? </p><p>\tAfter we had arranged to have a brief exchange online, I took one cursory look through his emails and saw code everywhere. I immediately thought that the formatting had gone wrong somewhere down the line and sought to fix it. However, at another glance, I noticed that many of his answers simply contained long streams of data. This much was clear; he was <i>obsessed</i> with code. As it transpires, Jacob (the man behind CEP2plet) is interested in studying the interface between language and symbolic logic, so this might help us understand why. I ask how he has been spending his time recently; “I spend most of my time looking into my computer screen, working on stuff like my music, programming ideas, and foundational issues in mathematics, like which theory would be best to use as a foundation for mathematics; set theory, category theory, or the one I believe to be the most preferable: language theory” he begins. “I prefer language theory, because the other theories assume an alphabet and syntax, while alphabets and syntax is what language theory is about. I can set the difference as follows: “∙” is the symbol for the metalanguage, meaning it’s the only symbol in the metalanguage’s alphabet. So, here’s a listing of the words I can form with this one symbol…</p><p>∙<br>∙∙<br>∙∙∙<br>∙∙∙∙<br>∙∙∙∙∙</p><p>…and so on. It’s not really a visually appealing or impressive language. There’s really only two rules of syntax going on, so, at any point, I can just construct another ∙ any time whenever. That’s the metalanaguage” he continues. “It just so happens to be the case that I can represent all other formal languages as sublanguages of the metalanguage by setting all the words of the metalanguage with names…</p><p>∙\t\t\t∙<br>∙∙\t\t\tʔ<br>∙∙∙\t\t\th<br>∙∙∙∙\t\t\tɦ<br>∙∙∙∙∙\t\t\tʡ</p><p>…and so on.”</p><p>\tHis next planned release aims to provide his thesis on the philosophy of mathematics as a complementary supplement. I ask how he goes about creating those staggering compositions, “most of my tracks are actually recursively generated according to certain compositional rules of syntax. The reason they sound so diverse is partly because of the unpredictable noise of mixing artefacts together, and partly because the recursive process itself can be really long, allowing for all kinds of sounds to be part of the process. If I wasn’t so impatient, each of my tracks would be at least 20 minutes long. I also don’t use many copyright-free samples anymore. Now I just use samples of sounds from the previous tracks I’ve made, and a whole track will be made from just one sample. All the diverse sounds are all generated from combinations of effects on the one original sample.\"</p><p>\tThis obsession for permutations, combinations and code infiltrates the way his entire musical persona is constructed. His track names, for example, are almost always lengthy strings of symbols, which he describes as “a standardized way of naming, just like chemical formulas”. He proceeds, “I’ve experimented with anagrams, number sequences, plain-English titles, even specially-phrased titles. Recently, with this new batch of tracks, I have gotten closer to what I’ve been seeking. The names of these tracks reflect their ancestry [see top image]. Since I always now make tracks that are made from one sample of sound, I can name a track a sequence of alphanumeric characters, and any other track I make that is derived from a sample of that track, the name of that newly derived track will be a subsequence of its ancestor’s name.” </p><p>\tEven his moniker is imbued with niche symbolic meaning; “CEP2 is the acronym for Cool Edit Pro 2, the audio editor I use, and a septuplet is a 7-beat polyrhythm in music theory” he explains. “Since I have practiced performing polyrhythms on and off, I can only get up to a quintuplet over a sextuplet simultaneously. I can perform all other polyrhythms with either hands, with all possible combinations of polyrhythms with either hands, underneath the 5-with-6 combination. I love polyrhythms and I love Cool Edit Pro 2. Now you know how to pronounce ‘CEP2plet’.” This may enlighten us somewhat, but CEP2plet is still a mystery to me. The podcast that he has kindly provided us with is no less puzzling; a relentless torrent of glitch and noise that lasts over eighty minutes as a monolithic headfuck.

    "content": "<p>Austrian musician Susanne Kirchmayr has worked rather tirelessly over her career. Pedaling leftfield electronica for over 25 years under her Electric Indigo pseudonym, Kirchmayr has explored everything from granular synthesis to compositions for theatre, sound installations and various different strains of techno.</p>\n<p>She also founded the female:pressure network in 1998 with the aim of supporting upcoming female producers in a severely unequal landscape. 17 years on and the platform has grown far beyond expectations, with over 12,000 members spanning 60 countries around the world.</p>\n<p>With a performance at Krake festival upcoming, we decided to catch up with Kirchmayr to discuss female:pressure, vocal manipulations and what it was like to work at Hardwax in the 1990s.</p>\n<p><strong>So ﬁrst off how are things? You're helping curate Popfest Wein, how is that going?</strong></p>\n<p>July is actually really busy - so things are very good! I just came back from Madrid and played a DJ set at '://about blank' in Berlin. I also performed a concert at Heroines of Sound Festival, Radialsystem V on the 10 July, then had a gig in Vienna at good old Flex. Next I have Popfest Wien where I’ll have to present 57 acts together with my co-curator Trishes over four days from the 31st. I’ll also play at Nachtdigital Festival. In between I have to adapt my MORPHEME piece for Krake Festival because I want to add a new part specially for the occasion…</p>\n<p>Curating Popfest Wien with Stefan Trischler (aka Trishes) was a really good experience. The festival is for Austrian acts only, meaning we could only invite artists who either live in Austria or are Austrian citizens, or collaborative projects with Austrian artists. This limitation made me learn a lot about the Austrian scene and the indie/band scene during the past year. Usually, I’m not very involved in the pop-sphere so it was very interesting for me to take this dive in from the outside. The great thing was that my distanced view of that scene was really appreciated and I got along with Trishes really well. He comes from a hip-hop and soul background and it was surprisingly easy for us to make decisions together. Without having known each other before, it turned out we have a lot in common when it comes to musical taste, sociopolitical views, love for sound etc.</p>\n<p><strong>I was a big fan of your EP for Suicide Circus - your tracks seem to reach a very effective midpoint between your more club-focused sound and the granular experiments you have been composing. Would you say this is a fair observation? When did you ﬁrst develop an interest in granular synthesis in the ﬁrst place?</strong></p>\n<p>Thank you! And yes, that is a very fair observation! I am slowly arriving at a point where my two main musical interests - techno on the one hand and music that can be described as electro-acoustic/avant-garde on the other - come together and fuse in single compositions. But of course I feel that I have to go further - I’m not there yet.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/183606093&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>My interest in granular synthesis came from the idea of transforming spoken word recordings in various languages into increasingly abstract sounds. It is the most obvious method, I guess. But of course, there were other granular transformations I used before - mainly using Ableton Live audio effects like GrainDelay, or MaxForLive devices like GrainFreeze by Robert Henke. For my ﬁrst multichannel piece “Structuring Contours” I wanted to spatialize monophonic synthesizers, in particular my Multimoog with slowly increasing, differing microtonal shifts for each channel - a less easy objective than I originally intended as I wanted to play the shifts live.</p>\n<p>Luckily, I was already friends with Robert Henke and he helped me with building an M4L device based on a granular delay that could do microtonal shifts as a live audio effect - naturally with a slight delay though. This was another step to start to get a bit deeper into “grains”.</p>\n<p><strong>I read that you were experimenting with creating music using spoken word recordings - can you tell us a little bit more about this project? Is it still ongoing?</strong></p>\n<p>I composed several rather conceptual pieces based on recordings of spoken word in different languages. The ﬁrst one was “Chiffres”, a commissioned work for e_may/Wien Modern Festival. I had to compose a 15 minutes work and made a piece with 15 parts, each one minute long.</p>\n<p>For each part I used recordings of the respective number in over 20 languages and dialects; for the ﬁrst minute I used all ones, for the second all twos and so on. Between every minute there is a short break with a countdown that starts at 15 and ends at zero which is also the end of the piece. I made a call on Facebook and through our female:pressure mailing list asking people to record the numbers 0 to 20 in their mother-tongues (I ﬁrst thought the piece was going to be 20 minutes) and I got a lot of very nice and very different recordings. I still use the recordings to check multichannel connections at soundchecks!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/546/19711259359_3fe83c8336_c.jpg\" alt=\"electric-indigo\"></p>\n<p><em>Electric Indigo &amp; Angelina Yershova in Rome, 2014.</em></p>\n<p>Shortly after that I was invited to perform at a concert/reading together with the Austrian writer Valerie Fritsch and it was immediately clear to me to use her text to make the music. Quite a few other projects followed. I am very much into language and linguistics, I studied linguistics for a while and I’ve loved reading since I was a little child. Words, verbal expressions and variations, grammar, word forms, characters and so on are quite fascinating for me…</p>\n<p>'MORPHEME' which I will play as an A/V concert together with Thomas Wagensommerer for Krake Festival this year is completely derived from a sentence Sadie Plant said: &quot;To let noise into the system is a kind of ﬁne art in both cybernetic terms and in terms of making music, too.”  Thomas makes the video with 3D representations of each character and I used the recording of Sadie Plant saying this as my basic raw material.</p>\n<p>This summer, I will probably do some abstractions of pop song lyrics for a commissioned work for Wien Modern 2015 which will premiere in November.</p>\n<p><strong>I believe I am right in saying you worked at Hardwax for a while, what are some of the standout memories from working there? Was it much different back then to how it is now?</strong></p>\n<p>I think the biggest difference was the frenzy upon the arrival of new records and on Fridays before the most important weekend gigs. The shop was full with DJs - stars, no-names and newcomers - and all of them listened to the buyer who unpacked the new arrivals and skipped through the records. If they liked what they heard their arm went up and they tried to make eye contact with one of the staff member to get hold of a copy. It was really funny! The whole music distribution worked completely different from nowadays, there were no previews online and no immediate digital copies of tracks available. So people's curiosity, eagerness and excitement was huge and it was also quite difﬁcult to get an early copy of a hot record as usually only a few arrived at ﬁrst. So the “ordinary” customers had to wait a week or more after “V.I.P.” customers already bought it…</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about your work composing for theatre and ﬁlm as well? How did you ﬁrst get into this kind of work and do you think it has had a big effect on the music you produce solo?</strong></p>\n<p>I think my ﬁrst soundtrack for a short ﬁlm was for an art video about Nicola Tesla by Marko Lulic. The ﬁrst time I made music for a theatre play was much later, in 2011. The director Barbara Klein asked my colleague Pia Palme and me to create the music and play it live for her staging of “Das kleine Zimmer am Ende der Treppe” by Carole Fréchette. Working for theatres is quite a challenge because basically the music needs to be ready before the director, choreographer and actors start to develop a scene. But to make the right music I need to get a concrete idea about how a scene is going to be staged. It seems to be impossible but somehow, with great ﬂexibility, a quick workﬂow and very little sleep it works out in the end. This doesn’t only apply to the score but also to costumes, stage design and the whole technical setup. It is a very intense kind of team work and an extremely effective exercise in terms of musical creation, production and spatial acoustics, too! Almost every time I've made music for theatre I've used the material for other projects later on, developed it further and put it in new contexts.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/64977094&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>You are founder of female:pressure - have you been surprised by how signiﬁcantly the project has grown since you ﬁrst established it? Has it been good seeing other people become more directly involved, like with AGF's 'Visibility' project?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, I’m quite happy and positively surprised about the impact female:pressure has had especially in the past two years. I founded the network in 1998 and for 15 years it grew slowly but steadily. Since 2013, when we managed to release our ﬁrst facts survey and the respective press release in nine languages, it became a lot more obvious how well the database, network and the associated channels can be used to create international media feedback and awareness of the diversity lacking in electronic music and digital arts. The network has only been alive because of individual engagement by its members so the direct involvement by people like AGF and many others was always given to a certain degree. But the more it happens the happier I am!</p>\n<p><strong>You have an appearance at Krake in August, is this the ﬁrst year you've played the festival? Who else are you looking forward to seeing on the lineup?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, it’s going to be my ﬁrst time at Krake Festival. I’m especially looking forward to the exhibition at Urban Spree and I’m very excited that I will be able to see my friends Inner8 and Ken Karter play live for the ﬁrst time. Of course, the whole program sounds super promising. It is very hard to pick out single events, but I’m also very curious to see Solaris play - I love her mixes that I've heard online.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally, what else do you have in store over the rest of 2015? Any upcoming releases/ projects you are able to tell us about?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s going to be busy: the aforementioned new composition for Wien Modern that is going to deal with number one hits in the U.S. Billboard charts, a new solo live show that is going to be more danceﬂoor oriented - a combination of soundscapes and rather brute, industrial beats that I’ll premiere under a highway bridge for Architektursommer Rhein-Main in September and will hopefully also play for City of Women in Ljubljana in October. I will hold a workshop about granular synthesis at the Ableton Loop Summit end of October/ beginning of November. The next releases are going to be “109.47 b” - an ambient track on a female:pressure compilation on Different Is Different Records which is a derivative work of 109.47 degrees that I just performed at Heroines of Sound Festival in Berlin, a remix I just did together with Monolake for Cio D’Or on Semantica, and I also have a new track on the Krake compilation for the early bird ticket buyers...</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/27930433&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p>Antye Greie Ripatti, better known as AGF, recently hosted an all-day workshop at one of London’s best experimental music venues, Cafe OTO. In the day, we were invited to participate in “an afternoon of playful music-making for all ages” — fusing lo tech gamelan-style DIY string instruments with hi tech iPad technology. This then, laid an appropriate foundation for the evening proceedings, since AGF’s work has frequently married traditional styles with modern performance techniques.</p>\n<p>Her rendition of ‘A New Woman’, for example, was particularly touching. The piece is inspired by Hiratsuka Raicho, who published Japan’s first all-women’s literary magazine more than a hundred years ago. The opening of the collection refers back to the Japanese foundation myth of Amaterasu, goddess of the sun, who emerged out of a cave and brought sunlight back to the universe. It reads, “[i]n the beginning, woman was truly the sun. An authentic person. Now she is the moon, a wan and sickly moon, dependent on another, reflecting another’s brilliance.” AGF’s reinvention of the message carries with it an added technological dimension, as she creates contorted glitch modulations in the vocal.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the event stressed that “all ages are welcome from 5 upwards”, and that no prior experience was necessary for the workshop. Again, this underlines one of the key aspects of AGF’s work: inclusivity. Indeed, the highlight of the show involved an inclusion of audience participation, as we were encouraged to collectively produce any noise that we could muster. “It could be a low hum”, she explained, “or the soft whisper of wind”. The result was an uneasy creaking around the Cafe, providing a eery juxtaposition for AGF’s own contribution; a spoken rap of HTML code in German. “I want to dedicate this to Edward Snowden” she declared, “because he is always telling us to encrypt, and he is right”.</p>\n<p>Photo &amp; Video by <a href=\"http://www.whiteemotion.com\">Blanca Regina</a></p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/whiteemotion/19732362518/in/album-72157655804541960/\" title=\"AGF video extract @Cafe Oto, London\"><img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/379/19732362518_cc3c7b6e5b_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" alt=\"AGF video extract @Cafe Oto, London\"></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Brewer Street car park is becoming something of an unlikely institution in the world of audiovisual arts. Yes, largely as you might expect the building is just a car park, however the top floor plays host to a rotating series of exhibitions, free and completely open to the public. Across May Ryoji Ikeda held his 'Supersymmetry' installation there, drawing on his work as a resident at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in 2014 to present an audiovisual interpretation of a theory attempting to explain why particles have mass. For the past month, it has been the turn of one of Ikeda's closest connections in electronic music and another musician drawing similar influence from science and mathematics to take over the space, Raster Noton founder Carsten Nicolai.</p>\n<p>Nicolai is no stranger to audiovisual installation work, previously displaying pieces at the Tate Modern in London, the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin, and Haus Konstruktiv in Zurich just to name a few. His exhibition on Brewer Street features two separate installations - 'Bausatz-Noto' (1998) and 'Unicolor' (2014). The former sees four turntables playing together with a series of interchangeable records. Each is cut with a different locked groove, allowing for a mesh of warped grooves and avant-garde timbres to be played continuously in different speeds and combinations. The piece finds a fitting home at Brewer Street - the purpose of the experiment in part being to allow people of all ages, from musical and non-musical backgrounds to participate in the creation process.</p>\n<p>The primary focus of Nicolai's tenancy at the venue however, is 'Unicolor'. The piece follows on from two previous works, 'Univrs/Uniscope Version' (2010) and 'Unidisplay' (2012), which experimented with the laws of perception. 'Unicolor' takes on an experiment of a different nature,  playing with our perception of colour specifically. Different primary tones are placed against one other; modulating at times painfully slowly, at others strobing intensely. The piece is an extention of Nicolai's interest in Goethe's 'Theory of Colours', displaying how our brains fill gaps in perception. Staring at a solid tone for an extended period for example triggers the complementary colour in our vision when we look away.</p>\n<p>Adding to the experience is the fact that Nicolai's display spreads infinitely in either direction, mirrors reflecting the panel of colours into an alluring panorama. Nicolai's crystal clear drones are expectedly befitting of the experience, the visual elements having a corresponding effect on what you hear. Aside from the scientific implications, the overall effect is incredibly magnetic, drawing you into an abstract world of sterilized sound and light which doesn't require much understanding to be thoroughly enjoyable.</p>\n<p>As Nicolai himself said during an interview with The Vinyl Factory: &quot;this piece is not trying to teach people something. The modules are triggers for the imagination. I want to test how aware we are of the reality that we unconsciously create.&quot;</p>\n<p><em>The exhibition is open daily (12-6pm except Mondays) and runs free of charge until August 2nd.</em></p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/104910449?color=ffffff&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"550\" height=\"310\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p>Marcus Coates’ audio-visual installation, Dawn Chorus, which ran at Brighton’s Fabrica gallery as part of Brighton festival this spring, is not what it first seems. Fabrica, an adapted church in Brighton’s city centre, is well-placed for drawing unsuspecting visitors into the gallery, and during Dawn Chorus the sound of birdsong was audible outside in the street, inviting in passers by with the prospect of a lush urban aviary. Once inside, the source of the avian chatter was revealed to be an amplified recording, but any disappointment gave way to beguilement as visitors were presented with an artwork comprising fourteen screens hung at various heights and angles within Fabrica’s high nave, each paired with the amplified song of a different bird. On each of the screens were sped-up recordings of people in everyday environments; in bed, in the bath, at an office desk, at the kitchen table, or sat behind the wheel in a car park, apparently mimicking the actions of the birds whose cries they have been juxtaposed with – with puffed chests, jutting heads, and pursed lips.</p>\n<p>Coates placed human and bird alongside each other to underline the similarities, but what makes Dawn Chorus so fascinating is that we are not listening to birdsong at all. What we hear are actually human voices - the voices of the people in the footage, who are all amateur singers Coates plucked choirs around Bristol. With the help of scientist Peter McGregor and field recording specialist Geoff Sample, he spent several mornings recording the dawn chorus of birds in Northumberland, He then isolated the individual birds, and slowed the recording right down (roughly 20 times) to a range that a human voice could replicate. A particular bird was assigned to a particular singer according to their vocal range, and they were asked to reproduce what they heard. The audio was fed through an invisible earpiece, with the singers immediately reproducing the sounds that they heard, and then the recording of the singers sped up to the pitch of birdsong. The awareness of this production process brings a new perspective on the piece, and proffers the rather unique idea that humans and birds are simply two species living on different wavelengths, at different speeds.</p>\n<p>Coates is a self-declared shaman, and makes artwork that attempts to make us aware of ourselves as animals, as part of the natural world and not apart from it. So many artists fall into the clichés of primitivism to express this idea, as if we are somehow more human, more animal, when foraging for berries in a loincloth than sat at a desk checking our emails. What Coates understands and conveys so effectively is that the everyday places we inhabit, our homes and workplaces, are our natural habitats. True, our social and cultural lives and our built environments do serve to detach us from ourselves as mortal, organic animals, but Coates rightly recognises that there is nothing unnatural about them. The point is not that, for example, our homes are like our nests - rather they are our nests.</p>\n<p>Coates chose a selection of books to accompany the work in the gallery space, and the titles he chose are telling of the different interpretations that can be brought to bear on the piece. Alongside books about sound art were books about the history of music making, and Dawn Chorus encourages us to think too about why we make and listen to music. Is it biological? Is it cultural? Is there a reason at all? I’m reminded of a story that Laurie Anderson tells in her stage performance <em>All The Animals</em> about a concert she organised outside Sydney Opera House in 2010 where people were encouraged to bring their dogs. At the close of the concert the dogs, hundreds of them, started howling en masse and making a racket, in her words, “just because they can”.</p>\n<p><em>Dawn Chorus ran at Fabrica, Brighton, from 3 April – 25 May.</em></p>\n",

    "content": "<p>I first came across Jasmine Guffond's work at what felt like the perfect time. Already gorging on minimal drone to soundtrack Autumnal bus journeys, I stumbled across her album <em>Yellow Bell</em>. <em>Yellow Bell</em> is both an abstract work of electronic experimentalism, and a folk album, with Guffond's melancholic croons filtering through at delightful intervals. At times, there is little but a small, meditative hum, like the sound of a computer on standby. Occasionally, however, her cries come through pure and distilled, such as on the brilliant 'Elephant'.</p>\n<p>The concept of 'Yellow Bell' derives from an ancient Chinese tradition that Guffond came across while researching ideas and mythologies connecting sound to systems of universal harmony and structure. &quot;The general idea of a fundamental tone that relates to society’s place in the cosmic order and the idea that this tone should be adjusted from time to time is present throughout&quot; she explains.</p>\n<p>She cites influences as diverse as Eliane Radigue and György Ligeti except, she notes, his operas... Guffond has also worked extensively on other semi-musical projects, including an app that generates sound from nearby mobile and internet activity. In light of her latest album, and her ongoing projects this year, we decided to catch up with Guffond to talk CCTV, Sonification and ‘Sound Selfies’.</p>\n<p><strong>So how has 2015 been for you since the release of ‘Yellow Bell’? What kind of response have you had to the record?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s been great - I appreciate the overall response as very positive with nice reviews and the label selling out of the vinyl; certainly in part due to the beautiful handmade covers!</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/187496474&color=9d9795&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Can you expand a little on the mythological background of the title?</strong></p>\n<p>One account of the legend of The Yellow Bell begins in the third millennium B.C.E. The Emperor of China, Huang-Di, sent his mathematician Ling-Lun to the western mountains near India and instructed him to cut bamboo pipes from which the fundamentals of music could be derived. The bamboo tube upon which all other pitches and measurements were based was called the Yellow Bell. This foundation tone was considered to be an exact pitch representing a divine principle in harmony with the forces of the universe. From that time on, each successive dynasty with its new emperor was compelled to recalcaulate the length of the Yellow Bell. This new tone would redefine the entire system so as to have the best spiritual and mathematical foundation possible, thereby bringing the new dynasty in tune with the natural order of the universe.</p>\n<p><strong>What is your interest in ‘interventions’? How do you use sound to intervene with a space/venue or situation?</strong></p>\n<p>Through projects over the last couple of years I realized that I’m more interested in working outside of gallery contexts, intervening in everyday situations and public space. For example, a recent work – ‘<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/127201682\">Anywhere, All the Time, A Permanent Soundtrack to Your Life</a>’ is an android application that sonifies Wi-Fi and GPS networks. It is intended to be used while walking with headphones connected to a portable smart device – usually a phone. When walking with the app, one intercepts Wi-Fi and GPS infrastructure and their sonification creates a compositional mapping within our everyday environments. As a mobile composition I became interested in walking as a critical way of engaging with urban and everyday reality and by providing an audible presence for Wi-Fi and GPS networks, I wanted to provide a platform through which to explore the intertwining of physical territory and the immaterial information networks that define our urban environments.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you mean by “sonification” here? I understand that you have “sonified” facial recognition algorithms too right?</strong></p>\n<p>I produced a few projects last year that sonified facial recognition technology. One was during a ‘Protest and Technology’ conference at the Technical University in Berlin. I provided participants with the opportunity to make a ‘Sound Selfie’. People sat before the inbuilt camera on my computer and facial recognition algorithms detected and analysed their faces. The individual facial data was then translated into sound, producing sonic imprints of individual faces. Following the usual chain of events for a ‘Selfie’, the ‘Sound Selfies’ were instantly uploaded and archived to a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/soundselfie\">Facebook page</a>. I was interested in contemporary modes of participatory surveillance that are often based on the intentional disclosure of personal information by users of social media, mobile apps and online platforms. The identity of participants was abstracted into sound via a basic form of FM synthesis. I wanted to emphasise the reductive process of digitally encoding the face into a few basic measurements. I’m curious about what this means when our identities, choices, and personalities are transformed into streams of data under the algorithmic gaze. What is the intersection of the online data profile and the offline person? I see it as a shift towards a post-human culture. Life has a UI and we have a data self.</p>\n<p><strong>We’re based in London — CCTV capital of the world — but how do you see the major differences between Sydney and Berlin in terms of Government surveillance and data mining? What do you think is the most important point of action for musicians and artists in resisting these Government strategies?</strong></p>\n<p>Australia has recently passed a meta data retention law enforcing telephone &amp; Internet providers to keep the meta data of all Australian citizens for two years. I guess comparatively Australia is looking worse in terms of government surveillance than Germany however since the Snowden leaks there has been plenty of evidence that the BND (Germany’s foreign intelligence agency) has collaborated with the NSA and the GCHQ in mass surveillance of its own citizens and the NSA’s largest data collection centre in Europe is located in Germany in Griesheim.</p>\n<p>Many artists are critiquing and dissecting contemporary surveillance, sometimes via the co-option of surveillance technology itself or perhaps by visualizing or sonifying modes of surveillance. It’s a resistance against surveillance that aims to produce a visibility (or audibility) as discussion in the public sphere and however momentarily or playfully, destabilize the imbalance of power and control inherent to surveillance states. So, although there are to my knowledge no mass surveillance programs using smart phone technology, the technology is available and is definitely being used by the NSA, for example, to target individuals. By creating an app that sonifes the networks through which we could be surveyed I wanted to provide the option to listen back and reflect upon how it feels to live in a culture where our public space is mediated by technological infrastructure that is empowering in terms of communication as well as compromising in terms of the potential of surveillance.</p>\n<p>Other forms of resistance available to everyone are encryption tools such as the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en\">Tor Browser</a> (anonymous browsing) <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/privacybadger\">Privacy Badger</a> (plug-in for your browser that blocks trackers), <a href=\"https://startpage.com\">Startpage</a> (private search engine, same as using Google but your computer IP address is anonymous) and so much more!!

Do you think we should reject or embrace it as a new method of music distribution? Do you think it has opened up potentially problematic issues with information privacy, security, etc.?</strong></p>\n<p>I think we need to rethink conventional paradigms for music distribution. This is happening anyway of its own accord, via digital technology and - as you suggest - music piracy both providing a challenge to a dominant power structure: the mainstream entertainment industry. How this usually plays out is with large entertainment corporations suing individuals for downloading audio files. Although file sharing can be good for the industry, suing contemporary cultural exchange seems to have developed into a new line of revenue for major music business. I’m not anti copyright, when people buy my music, or films pay to use it I earn money from doing something I feel passionate about and that’s great, but I am against copyright when its used as a control mechanism by corporations that sit on swathes of rights and may not even be acting in the interest of the artists whose rights they own. One case of a peer-to-peer file-sharing platform, The Pirate Bay, being convicted of contributory copyright infringement is a revealing example of mechanisms of power extending from the entertainment industry to the legal system and government. The U.S. warned Sweden that if they didn’t get rid of the site, they would impose trade sanctions and Pirate Bay co-founders were sentenced to jail for copyright infringement. It’s simply getting harder to encapsulate information into discrete units and sell it so the entertainment industry pushes through various acts such as SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act), etc. in an attempt to police the Internet. Just recently in Australia a new site blocking act was passed – the Copyright Amendment, Online Infringement Bill - enabling copyright holders to block piracy related websites via the Australian judicial system. In effect any website that doesn’t comply with Australian copyright law or ‘facilitates copyright infringement’ could be blocked via a Federal Court order. It was rushed through in 3 months with little opposition - probably due to the fact that Village Roadshow had contributed between $227,500 and $329,919 to the two major Australian political parties in the last financial year.  But in answer to your question, let’s embrace contemporary modes of file sharing, preferably via a VPN!</p>\n<p><strong>I get the impression that you are more involved in the world of sound art and installations these days than music per se. Do you feel as though there are different creative freedoms that can be afforded by each medium, or are they fundamentally aiming at the same target?</strong></p>\n<p>I find music and art to be different processes (though not entirely) engaging different (though not exclusively) parts of myself. Across both I feel completely creatively free, limitations are usually imposed from outside structures, technological limitations and of course especially for art projects, budget. In respect to budget I really am totally free with music as I create and produce it all myself at home – though I do need new monitors! In terms of audience reception or environment the ‘target’ is different. Music has a clearly established audience / artist dynamic and is still very much oriented toward the spectacle. I’ve reached a personal threshold where I can no longer play behind the sound system, listening and mixing my music through half decent monitors and it can be surprisingly difficult to convince a promoter that I don’t want to perform from the stage, but rather in front of the sound system. I work with a visual artist, <a href=\"http://www.ilankatin.com\">Ilan Katin</a>, who maps extremely minimal (and beautiful), hypnotic video projections during my live show, however I provide almost no visually performative element so it really doesn’t seem necessary for me to be on stage. In some ways the music industry is way more limiting in terms of conventions of expression and still very connected to the idea of entertainment. In that sense art can be conceptually more open and is often more directly connected to discourse.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally, what else have you got planned for the rest of the year? Any exciting projects you can tell us about?</strong></p>\n<p>A couple of things - a split vinyl release with the Turkish artist <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/biblo\">Biblo</a> -  ‘Change / Future Present’ - is due to come out on the <a href=\"http://www.csides.net\">C Sides</a> label in autumn. And I’m excited about going to Australia this year to present &amp; conduct Listening Walks for <em>Anywhere, All the Time, A Permanent Soundtrack to Your Life</em> as well as live shows for the <a href=\"http://www.liquidarchitecture.org.au\">Liquid Architecture Festival</a>.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/126540809?color=f5f5f5&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"550\" height=\"309\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <p>Music: Jasmine Guffond - Somnabulant | Visuals: ilan Katin<br /> <br /> http://jasmineguffond.com | https://www.facebook.com/jasmineguffond<br /> https://www.facebook.com/ilankatin<br /> <br /> 2nd camera: Francesco Scarpa<br /> http://www.francescoscarpa.com</p>",

    "content": "<p>Spanish duo Surit and Samot, aka NX1, have always had a strong DIY ethos. Their debut 12&quot; hit stores with the bare minimum of information, an 'X' stamped to the centre label and the tracks titled simply 001-003. The record was also self-released by the duo, and their Nexe label has acted exclusively as a platform for their own material ever since. Aside from their growing catalogue of self-released material, NX1's dense, slow-burn techno has also found itself pushed by some of the most discerning techno labels out there, such as Semantica, M_Rec &amp; Inner Surface Music.</p>\n<p>As performers NX1 have shot to international acclaim similarly rapidly, their live sets mediating between abstract and dancefloor timbres with a similar charge of adrenalin found in their recorded works. With a performance at Festival Forte coming up next month, we decided to catch up with NX1 to discuss some of their most memorable gigging experiences in years gone by.</p>\n<p>##1 Berlin_2012##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/348/20222035532_dcb31f5f88_b.jpg\" alt=\"berlin\"></p>\n<p>The first gig that comes to our mind is one of our first experiences playing live as NX1.  It was three years ago and we had only played once before that. We had only released our first three records and a couple of remixes, but we were requested to do a live show in Tresor. It was for a night with Tadeo, Oliver Deutschman and Freddy K. For us it was special because it was in the beginning and the idea to prepare a live set for the first time in that historic place was really exiting, we never expected that our first live set would be there. Once in the club the hour that we played felt as if we had just played five minutes. This is why that night was so memorable for us.</p>\n<p>##2 Gijón_2010##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/460/20221685302_9514bd2644_b.jpg\" alt=\"gijon\"></p>\n<p>From many years ago when we first discovered him, we have enjoyed the music of Murcof. All his first albums (Martes, Utopía, Remembranza and Cosmos) are special and unique for us. We have also been related to some audiovisual projects in the past, so a lot of people who know this world will know the excellent work of AntiVJ. There is a Festival in the north of Spain, in Gijón, called L.E.V. (Laboratorio de Electronica Visual) which we used to attend for some years and in 2010 we realised that AntiVJ and Murcof were doing a live set together.</p>\n<p>It's a project they've been performing at a few festivals during the last year, and that was one of the first times they did. It's a festival where you can see very special and interesting, inspiring things and investigate new ways of expression using sound and video with other artistic disciplines. The location is truly amazing, a thundering architectonic piece with mystery and beauty in almost every corner. We saw AntiVJ and Murcof live in a theatre, everyone seated in armchairs. When they finished people stood and started to applaud as if it was an opera. The quality of the performance was overwhelming for us and the feeling we had there was just indescribable, we never enjoyed another performance so much in that way.</p>\n<p>##3 Porto Cristo_2009##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/549/20203812166_a8848a1735_b.jpg\" alt=\"porto\"></p>\n<p>Back in the days when we were living in Mallorca (where we're from) we started to collaborate and organise parties around the island. We were totally isolated in terms of music and venues that were interesting for us, so we decided to start booking artists that we used to like to give people ourselves an alternative to the usual acts around the island in those days. One of those times we found an open air venue and booked Sir James Ruskin among other artists. Just a few minutes from that location we had a club where we used to program events for many years - a very small but very powerful club that used to be our &quot;headquarters&quot;.</p>\n<p>James did a great set as usual in the open air (we already booked him a few times before that), so when the party finished we invited him to come and play there. The place was packed and very hot as it was Summer… the walls were sweating. He started to play, scratching two Jeff Mills records, the same on both turntables, and the following three hours were totally different to what he played at the open air stage that night. There we could see how a real DJ, when an artist feel totally comfortable, is able to be.</p>\n<p>##4 Lithuania_2013##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/380/20043515339_103576af8c_b.jpg\" alt=\"lithuania\"></p>\n<p>It was our first time in Lithuania. We were going to a festival that takes place in the Lithuanian National Park, a huge remote forest so beautiful that you can feel totally at harmony with nature. We remember driving from Vilnus to the festival took more than two hours, and one of those hours was totally across the forest, raining and going very slow. The location was totally amazing. Pure, and also we were able to enjoy some really nice performances from renowned artists and locals.</p>\n<p>We started to play when it was totally dark, but the last half an hour of our set was during a lovely sunrise that revealed to us a gorgeous lake not so far from the forest. We had magnificent views from the stage and that moment was precious. We enjoyed the people, the artists and everything involved in that gig a lot. It was that magic of raving between nothing - lost in the nature that trapped us. We stayed two days there, and would have been happy to have never left that place.</p>\n<p>##5 Amsterdam_2014##</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/556/20235658231_be0fc095af_b.jpg\" alt=\"amsterdam\"></p>\n<p>If we have to mention one of the best gigs we played recently it could be the night that we played at Trouw in Amsterdam. We stayed for a few days at a friend's place, which already change the dynamic of going just for a night or day in an hotel room. We both love the city and that gig was epic for us due to the connection with the people. The club was busy from the start and there were a lot of people coming from &quot;Welcome to the Future Festival&quot; that took place that day, so the mood in the club was excellent. It was one of the warmest performances we have ever played.</p>\n<p>The distribution of the club as well, with the DJ booth at the same level as the dance floor, with all the people around you dancing and screaming is amazing. They also had really powerful, clean sound. Definitely one of the gigs that we could never forget.</p>\n<p><em>For more details on Festival Forte, you can visit their website <a href=\"http://www.festivalforte.com/\">here</a>.</em></p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Photo: Lak­ker, Marie Wei­kopf © für BLN.FM</p>\n<p>Few producers have the stylistic scope that Lakker do. Their releases span across some of the most important labels in electronic music; R&amp;S, Blueprint, Stroboscopic Artefacts and more. This should really be no surprise as Lakker are not so much a duo trying to tap into ‘one sound’ but instead explorers of electronic music in all its forms. There are hints towards the ‘golden era’ of UK IDM, early 00s dubstep, as well as Birmingham techno and early rave. What comes across so strongly in Lakker’s output is that they are true scholars of the canon of electronic music. No history is omitted, and no territory unexplored. </p>\n<p>Their latest album, <em>Tundra</em> took a surprising turn by incorporating some classically inspired choral timbres, rediscovering their sound in yet another guise. In light of this release, R&amp;S' subsequent 12&quot; of remixes not to mention their performance at Berlin Atonal this year, we caught up with duo members Dara Smith and Ian McDonald earlier this month. </p>\n<p><strong>So how have things been for you since the release of Tundra? It’s been quite a while since the release of <em>Ruido</em> with your travels and various other projects...</strong></p>\n<p>I: things have been great since the release of <em>Tundra</em>, thanks! We're so happy with how it's been received. People seem to be really feeling it, which are very grateful for.\nWe had been thinking about it for a while. We didn't want to do a second album until the time was right. When things started kicking off for us a few years back we decided to focus on EPs and 12&quot;s for a while to explore our sound a bit. Another album was always on the cards, but not until we felt the sound was there and the time was right. Around the release of our Mountain Divide EP we felt that time was at hand, so we started thinking about the album seriously then. </p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/169150535&amp;color=95918f&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>How do you go about performing live these days? <em>Tundra</em> has a lot of vocal work on the album, have you ever tried performing your stuff with live vocals?</strong></p>\n<p>I:Our current live show is an audio-visual one. We both take care of different aspects of the audio live and Dara also runs the visuals live from onstage. We try to keep the tracks as close to the recorded versions as possible with enough room to change and develop things to keep it interesting for the audience and ourselves. The set-up is simple, two laptops MIDI- synced, and some controllers.</p>\n<p>We've never done a live set with vocalists as Lakker, but we did do a show a couple of years back with Soundset, who were a vocal and string ensemble based in Dublin. It was a partly improvised, partly written show. It was a really enjoyable experience working with voices in a live context like that, but it's not yet something we've fit into the Lakker show. We used to also do a collaborative project called 'Jenny &amp; the Deadites' with MC Jenny Branagan (now with Melbourne based darkwave band 'Nuns'), which was super fun (there's an old Myspace page knocking around somewhere!), and we have some more vocal collabs planned, so we're open to the idea in the future perhaps…</p>\n<p>D: The Vocals on the album are nearly all my girlfriend, Eileen Carpio, who is working on her own solo project at the moment, but mainly from a practical point of view,it just has never developed into something brought out live. For our Tundra A/V show, we'll be using the vocals just like another synthesiser or field recording and it's something we like to manipulate and rearrange on the fly.</p>\n<p><strong>I feel as though your sound takes on a new style in the album format, especially with Tundra. The album seems to take influence from many disparate kinds of music and bring them forward into a long narrative that follows a movement from start to finish.</strong></p>\n<p>I: That was definitely intentional. From the outset we wanted this album to be something to be listened to from start to finish, something that has a kind of narrative, or flow, even if it was loose or abstract. That to us is what an album is. We didn't want to put out simply a collection of tracks, which has it's place, but that's not what we wanted to do with this. We wanted to be quite traditional in it's format I suppose.</p>\n<p>We wrote most of it all at once, in a condensed period of time, so the tracks share similarities of the headspace we were in and the ideas we were interested in exploring. But there are one or two older tracks we included that fit the mood of the album. We then compiled the tracklist out of the pool of tracks we had, in conjunction with input from R&amp;S to arrive at the list we felt had the most flow.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://s86.photobucket.com/user/georgemc25/media/0d4938bd-a37d-4c6c-bcb2-74319ef76801_zpszgghknpy.jpg.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k114/georgemc25/0d4938bd-a37d-4c6c-bcb2-74319ef76801_zpszgghknpy.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\" photo 0d4938bd-a37d-4c6c-bcb2-74319ef76801_zpszgghknpy.jpg\"></a>\nPhoto by Amy Kelly</p>\n<p><strong>I was interested to hear that you’ve been influenced by the choral work of Arvo Pärt. I really liked what you said in the Fact interview about trying to find ‘the divine’ in music, which both club music and Arvo Pärt seem to do, albeit in very different ways. I see a real marriage of these two styles in a track like ‘Mountain Divide’ with it’s crazy, ecstatic build. What elements of music specifically are germane to reaching this divine or religious state, and do you think this is something specific to music?</strong></p>\n<p>I: I don’t think it is specific to music - I think trying to reach that divine state is about allowing your mind and body to go to a certain place where you can actually experience it, switching off from all the human, egoic, societal programming and filters that we all have, and just simply being, and loving. It’s hard to do without some help and guidance, but any artform can take you there. Maybe that’s what art is - a guide to higher realms, a pathway for us out of the mess we’re making of human existence. It’s easy to despair of humanity sometimes - just turn on the news or read a Facebook feed - but then you hear some beautiful music, or see an inspiring film or painting and you are reminded of beauty and love and you get closer to the truth of things. And music is a particularly good medium for expressing these kinds of feelings, or ideas. Nobody is immune to it - we’ve all had a little tear in our eye caused by sound. I think it’s the abstract nature of music. You can’t touch it or see it, it only ever exists momentarily as vibrations in air and yet if affects our lives so deeply. It has the power to transcend, to allow you feel love, or loved, it has the power to unite or divide, to destroy or redeem.</p>\n<p>Music allows us to express things that we cannot express through words. It allows us to feel them, and it reminds us of who we truly are. But I think ultimately it is not about expression, it is about experience. Music allows us to truly experience being alive, being in a moment, feeling, being, not doing. That’s pretty close to divine I reckon.</p>\n<p>D: I also feel that the physicality of modern sound systems and clubs brings an extra dimension to the the way we experience music live. Especially within certain clubs where you really feel like you're surrounded by walls of sound , and can feel the music throughout your whole body. These experiences are something that I feel influences me when writing our music, and I feel there are parallels between these moments and the experience of hearing powerful classical music in a Cathedral or specially designed concert hall. They're just different ways of attaining otherworldly states through sound.</p>\n<p><strong>I read that you prefer “doing your thing” than “trying to guess what people are expecting.” Do you think people expect you to go ‘all-out-techno’ in your performances? How do you try and avoid pandering to the audience in a live setting?</strong></p>\n<p>I: It’s a tough one. We definitely want to do our own thing. You can’t worry too much about what people are expecting, but at the same time we don’t want to alienate people who are into our music. Like most things, it’s a balance.</p>\n<p>We try to engage the audience in a meaningful way without pandering or alienating. It can be difficult. But the last thing we want to do is feel we know better than the audience or insult their intelligence. Totally guilty of it in the past! But we try not to be anymore. Live music is a shared, communal experience between everyone. The comedian Simon Amstell said that instead of trying to make his audience love him, he finds ways he can love his audience. I think this is a great attitude for performance.</p>\n<p>D: In the words of Drake’s Ghostwriters, “Know yourself”.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/132203712&amp;color=a09d9c&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I understand that you used to play in a Prodigy-inspired Rave band together - what kind of stuff were you playing back then? How did you first meet and start working together?</strong></p>\n<p>I: Haha, yes! We played for a few years in a band with two other mates of ours. Heavily influenced by The Prodigy, and bands like Deftones, Tool. Shouty, banging stuff with vocals and heavy electronic beats. Then we got into the Warp and Rephlex sound and the band dissolved and Dara and myself kept working together. That’s how we met and started working, through that first band.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you see the work of Lakker and associated labels like Stroboscopic as a present-day reincarnation of that Warp/IDM tradition? Do you think the term ‘Intelligent Dance Music’ is something we should try and avoid?</strong></p>\n<p>I: It’s not a conscious attempt to carry on a tradition, but that has always been the music that has influenced us most in our own work. It is what we were most interested in when we first started making music, and it still excites us - that idea of ‘Braindance’ - electronic music that moves you, but also makes you feel and perhaps think. Music that moves your body and engages your being, rather than just pure functionality in the dance.</p>\n<p>I don’t think the term ‘Intelligent Dance Music’ is something we should try to avoid, but at the same time it only has as much value as what any one person brings to it. As a handy descriptor of a certain type of music it is useful, but in terms of dance music needing to be ‘intelligent’, or needing to signify what is ‘intelligent’ as opposed to something that’s not, it’s maybe less helpful. We all have insecurities about how we are perceived as human beings and that certainly carries over into music. I’ve definitely fallen into this over the years. Wanting to be seen as ‘serious’ or ‘intelligent’ to feel validated. But now I feel that once the music is honest and from the heart then that is all it needs to be. Whether it be ‘experimental’ sound design, or balls-out bangers, once it comes from an honest place that is all the validity needed. This is not an easy thing to do in the kind of society we live in. One that puts a value on hype, trends, fashion, materialism, ‘coolness’, etc above sincerity. It’s difficult to be authentic in the age we live in. There’s a routine from the great stand-up comic Stewart Lee that addresses this - he asks what the last taboo in comedy is. Is it jokes about rape, or racism, or any other number of potentially extreme or taboo topics? He concludes that it is none of these things, it is simply a comedian trying to do something sincerely and well, then he proceeds to sing a song that reminds him of his wife, whom he loves. It is an amazing and touching piece of comedy and social commentary. So I understand the need for terms like ‘IDM’, I understand the need to feel accepted by one’s peers, to feel validated. But it is something we are trying to leave behind as individuals and try to be more honest and authentic with ourselves and with our work.\nPS = sorry for the Stewart Lee spoiler for anyone who hasn’t seen the routine…!</p>\n<p>D: I think its just basically different levels sound interest , for us its about trying to marry a level of interesting and original sounds with music that still moves you emotionally.</p>\n<p><strong>Lastly, what are your plans for the rest of the year? Any exciting projects you can tell us about?</strong></p>\n<p>I: the premiere of the Tundra live show at Atonal is the first thing! Then we’re taking the show on the road, for some festival performances and R&amp;S showcases. We’re planning the first shows outside Europe. Then back in the studio for some new material…</p>\n<p>D: Yeah I've been focused on the <em>Tundra</em> A/V show. Now I am trying to create something that reacts to the structural and rhythmic elements of the show in real time while also requiring some human input to help animate the elements to be more suited to the emotional ebb and flow of the music as well. It's a system that allows me to work on audio improvisations as well as the Visual output at the same time. We also have lots of other ideas up our sleeve for going further with these ideas and some other great projects on the horizon as well. Good times.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/211033041&amp;color=a09d9c&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Over the past few years, Barcelona based Adriana Lopez has become one of the defining acts of the Spanish techno scene. Having developed her skills as a DJ back in Colombia where she was raised, Lopez took influence from the early Detroit &amp; UK techno scenes, moving to Spain in 2002 where her work began to make a significant impression.</p>\n<p>Over 10 years on from her relocation and Lopez is one of Barcelona's most acclaimed artists, not least for her skills as a DJ but also as a producer and curator of her label, Grey Report. Founded as a platform for her own smoke-laced warehouse jams, Grey Report has grown to feature collaborations with some of Lopez's closest affiliates, including NX1 and Developer.</p>\n<p>With a performance at Festival Forte coming up at the end of the month, we decided to catch up with Lopez to discuss Grey Report, growing up in Colombia and how she first met NX1.</p>\n<p><strong>Hi Adriana, so first off how are things? You returned from your first Asia tour last month I believe - how did that go? Did you get to explore Singapore/Shanghai etc much or were they relatively quick stop-overs?</strong></p>\n<p>Things are going well. I have several projects in mind at the moment and am recording new material in the studio that’s going to be released shortly.  I'm really excited about the upcoming dates in Europe and the Americas, as well as with the positive results of the recent Asian Tour. I was booked to play in Taipei, Singapore, Shanghai and Beijing and it was a beautiful experience, not just because of the great response of the crowd at all the parties but also because I met some really nice people and had enough time to do some sightseeing and experience the local traditions.  I stayed for two weeks and I feel that I made the most of it, but it’s not enough time to really get to know their huge cultural heritage. I’m already looking forward to the next one.</p>\n<p><strong>You have a new EP out on Grey Report in September, 'Anonymity of Grey'. How long has that been in the works for?</strong></p>\n<p>“Anonymity Of Grey” is going to be the fifth release on the label and it’s been in the works for some months now. As it’s my first solo EP on Grey Report, I wanted it to be something special, not just in terms of the music and graphics but also in terms of the concept.  The promo campaign will start soon.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/160002407&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>How do you think Grey Report has developed since you first started it?</strong></p>\n<p>The label has developed pretty well and I’m very happy with the results so far.  The feedback has always been positive and the artists that have contributed to the label, as well as the ones confirmed for the upcoming releases, are great producers and friends who make really interesting music.  Moreover, the label is selling out of the vinyl and all the releases have been repressed to date.  I think that Grey Report is on its way to consolidating its own musical, artistic and conceptual identity.</p>\n<p><strong>NX1 have appeared on your label and on a Modularz split release with you previously. When did you first meet the pair? You are all still Barcelona based right?</strong></p>\n<p>We appeared together on 'Modularz 09' in 2012 and that’s how I got to know their music.  We’re all Barcelona based so months after the Modularz came out, we met here at Moog Club.  Since then we became friends and we’ve done mutual collaborations and appeared on a split release on Grey Report. I also did a remix for Rising, their agency’s label in 2014.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/413/19643779183_e533a1fddf_b.jpg\" alt=\"adriana\"></p>\n<p><strong>I also wanted to ask you a little bit about your time in Colombia - what was it like growing up there? Was there a big scene for electronic music?</strong></p>\n<p>Colombia is a country with a wide variety of musical traditions and an extended folklore so growing up there put me in contact with music since I was a little child.  However, although traditional music was, and is, the most popular genre in Colombia, some teenagers in the late 1980s and early 1990s, myself included, started to listen to rock, alternative and house music through radio and music TV channels.  The scene for electronic music started to grow in the late 1990s and it’s been expanding since then.  It was at that time when I was amazed by the new sound of Detroit and the UK;  the early releases of Dynamic Tension, Purpose Maker, Counterbalance and Peacefrog, among others.</p>\n<p><strong>When did you first learn to DJ too? Have you always mixed techno or were you more interested in other genres growing up?</strong></p>\n<p>It was in 1998 when I got my first pair of Technics and started buying techno records through specialized web shops in the USA.  In those days we were just a bunch of friends who shared the same musical tastes and ideas, so we decided to organize some techno parties.  In 2000 I became a resident DJ at Bogotá’s CBC club - the first 100% techno club in Colombia, and later on I started playing all over the country.  That’s how it all began.  I moved to Spain in 2002 and, for about two years, I also mixed jungle and drum n’ bass under a different name. I’m a big fan of both genres but I decided to focus on techno because it’s the one that lets me express myself best and the one with which I feel fully identified.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/137677359&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>You have been playing for over 15 years now right? What do you think is your most memorable experience in terms of playing out?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, it’s been over 15 years and it seems like yesterday!  It’s hard to say what is the most memorable experience as each gig has its own meaning.  However, if I have to choose one, I must say that Berghain has become one of my favorite places to play at, after last year and this year.  This is because it has a unique atmosphere that comes mainly from the combination of a massive sound system, an imposing architecture and a very receptive audience.  Besides that, the fact of playing longer sets allows you to build a journey with ups and downs going through different stages with the music.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally what do you have in store for the rest of the year? You are appearing at Festival Forte in August I believe - how did that come about and who else are you looking forward to seeing play there?</strong></p>\n<p>There are some new releases that will be out soon.  My first solo EP on Grey Report, “Anonymity Of Grey”, scheduled for September;  a Modularz split release coming out in November and the sixth Grey Report release for the end of the year.  I’m also recording new material for a Spanish label that should be out in 2016.  About the upcoming dates, as you mentioned, I’ll be playing at Festival Forte in Coimbra in August.  The festival is organized by Soniculture and they already booked me some months ago to play at Lux in Lisbon and Gare in Porto.  Those gigs were great so I’m looking forward to Forte, not just to playing there but to seeing Robert Henke’s audiovisual installation and Front 242 live.  Besides Festival Forte, I have other confirmed dates in Germany, Argentina, Canada, Spain, The Netherlands and more T.B.A. for the rest of the year.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/208570830&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>99942 Apophis is the name of a meteor discovered in 2004, named by a couple of Stargate SG1 enthusiasts-come-scientists. The comet caused panic on its discovery, as there was thought to be a high probability Aphosis would collide with the Earth in 2029, creating a crater 4.3km wide, having severe long-term effects on the globe. The extent of the danger is still open to discussion. Aphosis is also the subject Ike Yard's Stuart Argabright aka Black Rain and Italian artist Nino Pedone aka Shapednoise take inspiration from for their latest EP - an intriguing mix between cracked-out breakbeat and the frenetic glitch experiments of someone like Ryoji Ikeda or Sendai.</p>\n<p>Pedone &amp; Argabright maintain a dirt-caked tonal pallete across the release - otherwise crisp percussive flourishes feel pressure-blasted with distortion. Opener 'Metal Home' for example groans incessantly, like a building on the verge of collapse, its foundations warping under the weight of thousands of tonnes of concrete. There is something highly claustrophobic about the track's mangled assortment of textures, slowly giving way to clear, crystalline ambience in the closing seconds.</p>\n<p>You'd be mistaken if you took this as an indicator of  a more tranquil follower however. 'Autonomous Lethality' explodes into the headspace with frenetic, power-drill rhythms and off-kilter static assaults. Indistinct percussive blasts trample over one another, screeching UFO sirens adding to the chaos.</p>\n<p>Operating under the guise Miles Ramen, Demdike Stare's Miles Whittaker makes a fitting match as a remixer for the release, especially following Demdike Stare's Testpressing' records - a series of bit-fucked jungle and unhinged grime/garage offerings. Across his remix of 'Interceptor', blunt kick drums wade through a thick sludge of low-end, plummeting drones and wild synth modulations wreaking havoc in the backdrop.</p>\n<p>The original follows a more crisp, abrasive path, tempos twisting maniacally. The track's fluctuating speeds have a thoroughly disorientating effect, thumping low-end leaving just a fraction of regularity for the listener to cling onto.</p>\n<p>While back stories should never come above quality of the music, here Argabright and Pedone's thinking behind the EP does nothing but add to its appeal, setting sound in context. The EP's musing on the unrelenting sense of impending annihilation which could be wrought by the Aphosis asteroid calls to mind a film like Andrei Tarkovsky's 'Stalker', its constantly unsettled feel maintained right until the end.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/218946729&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Variations of the word 'fragment' crop up a lot with Ukrainian imprint FF'Space. The label's title itself is a flexible acronym, standing for either 'First Frequency Space' or 'Frame Fragmented Space'. Given that each track title is a play on the word 'fragment', I would imagine <em>A Hectic Truer</em>, the latest of Yu Miyashita's LP's under his Yaporigami guise fits the latter camp. The album sounds like the brooding, estranged cousin of his <em>Hertzian</em> LP and indeed, as the material for <em>A Hectic Truer</em> was written around the same time period back in 2012, this seems plausible.</p>\n<p>Deploying characteristically oddball, Raster-Noton like aesthetics, Miyashita has presented an LP which incorporates his interest in processing samples to their outermost limits with dancefloor sensibilities incredibly effectively. Track's like 'Fragmentary' or 'Fragmenting' feature limber, cut-stop sampling heavily, subtle glitches and electrical whirrings complementing Miyashita's crystal clear blasts of sub-bass.</p>\n<p>At times Miyashita's glitch-processing becomes increasingly ferocious. 'Fragmental' for example darts between static doused sounds, as if flicking through TV channels at an exceedingly impatient rate.  The result is a vaguely familiar of Alva Noto &amp; Anne James-Chaton's 'Uni-Acronym', but tailored for the club. The track snakes mechanically, twitching atmospherics and stumbling kicks dancing around Miyashita's skeletal vocal sampling.</p>\n<p>The crossover with Miyashita's <em>Hertzian</em> material becomes increasingly obvious at given moments. Take the loose slink of 'Fragment' or 'Fragmentarily's growling motor sounds and shattered glass textures. These are incredibly familiar with the tonal palette used across <em>Hertzian</em>, however rather than feeling reconstituted, the result is to draw Miyashita's varied works into a framework where sounds are shared and reused as a tasteful nod to his past work.</p>\n<p>Where its titles are variations on the same word, sonically the same concept fits across <em>A Hectic Truer</em>. Miyashita maintains a feeling of mechanical efficiency, creeping factory sounds and buoyant low-end providing the framework for each offering. Despite the fact the material was written around time of <em>Hertzian</em>, <em>A Hectic Truer</em> still feels fresh for Miyashita, and as his bank of previous releases attests, its always a pleasure to hear something new.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/213065766&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>I first came across Lesley Flanigan's work when someone sent me a video of her 2012 performance at UT Austin. Sitting on the floor she takes a microphone, sings a note into it, then slowly swings the microphone towards one of the speakers laid around her, sending a low, throbbing feedback through the system. The microphone slowly returns to her mouth, where she sings a little higher, then down again to the speaker, thickening the sounds. I watched the entire performance, having falling into an alert, steady rhythm of breathing, then proceeded to listen to nothing but <em>Amplifications</em> (2009) and <em>Glaciers</em> (2014) for three weeks straight. Her sonic loops gives you a sense of a constant return against an incessant progression; you're suspended between long clear ringing and crackling dissonance, until her voice appears from somewhere murky in the middle. So many layers appear and mutate, so why does it feel so pure, to the point of moving me to tears? I had so many questions for her, and I'm fortunate to say she kindly gave us answers as honest and arresting as her art.</p>\n<p><strong>So to kick things off what have you been up to recently? How has 2015 been for you so far?</strong></p>\n<p>This past spring I went on tour in Europe with Tristan Perich and Stephane Garin + Celine Flamen of Ensemble 0. Tristan and I brought our then 10-month-old with us, our first tour with our new family member. In June, I finished an artist residency at Roulette in Brooklyn, where I worked on a new project of mine called “Voices”, for 4 vocalists and 4 loop pedals. It was an entirely new working process for me, and I’m really happy with how the first performance turned out. Now I just need to sit with it a bit, and figure our how to develop it further.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3357167579/size=small/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/track=1321648319/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://lesleyflanigan.bandcamp.com/album/glacier\">Glacier by Lesley Flanigan</a></iframe>\n<p><strong>Much of your work is created with a circuit of amplifiers and speakers. It's a cohesive system, something like a closed circuit. Do you consider this an introspective approach to your sound?</strong></p>\n<p>I’ve always been rather introspective in my approach to making sound and music. On a conceptual level, I really love using feedback as a sound source. There are many layers of ideas I find intriguing: the fact that feedback is inherently a closed and intimate system, that the relationship between speakers and microphones is fundamental to all electronic sound, that speakers are microphones and visa versa, and that feedback is an electronic sound that you can physically produce. In a sense, feedback is a very real reminder that at the core of all electronic sound is a physical process.</p>\n<p>But what ultimately drove me to work with feedback is simply that I loved the sounds I was making with my feedback instruments. Their tones are incredibly rich, complex, imperfect, tangible and real. They are pure, unfiltered sound material. When I hear these sounds, I am overwhelming inspired to dive in and manipulate them. For me, it is a special process to collect their raw sounds with a microphone, and amplify them on a large scale. I love the moment when what was once a crusty little noise becomes a booming, warm bass swell of dense tonality. The sound itself never changed, but when amplified, its barely audible details are magnified, so we have the opportunity to hear it differently. By amplifying feedback tones, I’m trying to dig deeper and more introspectively into their sound. It is a very intimate experience.</p>\n<p><strong>I feel as though your sound-layers within this little environment bring out the transparency in your creative process — the audience can hold onto the gradual condensation of sounds. Is this intentional?</strong></p>\n<p>Transparency is built into my process by default. Working with feedback, what you see and hear is exactly what you get. I have limited control over the sound of my instruments, which means I have to embrace an amount of uncertainty in all my performances. My job is to figure out how work with the sounds that are happening in the moment.  If I pre-sampled sounds, and played back music I previously perfected, I’d have a greater amount of control, but the effect of the performance would be different. Given the material I’m working with, I think it’s meaningful to share the building process with my audience, for them to see the motions and materials behind my shaping noise into sound, and sound into music.</p>\n<p>It took a while before I was comfortable with this approach.  In a few of my earliest performances with feedback, I used a laptop to sample sounds, and I’d add filters and effects to “perfect” the sounds.  I also used pre-sampled material in order to perform prewritten songs. It’s not that this was necessarily bad, but I came to realize that all the effects I added were actually flattening the complexity of sound that originally inspired me. I was burying both the experience and the ideas behind my sound by processing it all through a computer.  When I decided to remove the laptop from my performances, it became much more interesting for me to really learn how to play my feedback instrument using my hands and a microphone.</p>\n<p><strong>In the past, you've worked with Luke DuBois, Maria Chavez, Mv Carbon and more. However, I sense an intimate and personal approach to your sound. How does collaboration work for you generally? Do you have a system for working with others?</strong></p>\n<p>I don’t really have a system of collaboration, because I typically don’t like to collaborate.  A collaboration for me really needs to somehow exist on an unspoken level.  It starts with being inspired by the sounds another person creates, and finding that there is room for those sounds to be heard both with and without me.</p>\n<p>Luke and I started performing together because we are great friends. In some ways I see our work less as an artistic collaboration and more as two friends having conversation… that happens to be made of sound, light, and music. It’s entirely intuitive.\nThere is serendipity to my work with Maria and Carbon. We have never rehearsed. We show up at a show, set up all our equipment on a table, then sit down and begin. Somehow this works for us. Carbon is fearless. Her instrumentation is completely original and organic, always with a raw edge. Maria is diligent, thoughtful and decisive. She has the confidence to sit in silence rather than perform a sound that isn’t right. I feel that my way of working exists between the two, so it’s been natural and inspiring to perform with them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://s86.photobucket.com/user/georgemc25/media/ff5c97bb-9579-4d47-a2c4-32a357fcd52c_zpstankxod5.jpg.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k114/georgemc25/ff5c97bb-9579-4d47-a2c4-32a357fcd52c_zpstankxod5.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\" photo ff5c97bb-9579-4d47-a2c4-32a357fcd52c_zpstankxod5.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>I’ve read that you feel inspired by the physicality of sounds — is this part of the reason why you have not released records as frequently as you have toured? Do you feel like there is something ‘missed’ in the physical aspect of your work on a recording? Can this only be captured in the experience of an actual live performance?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, I feel that a big part of what makes my music work is being present in the moment of its creation within a particular space with a particular audience. For example, it can take ten minutes or more to build up the sounds that make an incredible musical moment, and while this works live, it doesn’t always translate well into a recording.  It is just not the same thing.  I haven’t been very interested in releasing my live performances. I have some recordings where I am performing alone with my headphones on, but they are different… the context really changes the music.</p>\n<p>My sound and music has developed a lot since my album Amplifications was released. I do think I should have more recordings out to accurately tell the story of my work, but it’s hard to get excited about releasing CDs, records, or digital recordings. There is a disconnection between the music I love to make and the methods by which we consume recordings. I have some ideas for how to bridge the divide, but most of my focus has been in developing performance. That focus is beginning to shift…</p>\n<p><strong>In regards to this ‘physicality’ element, I’m particularly fascinated by your linkage to sculpture and how it relates to sound. How has sculpture and music fused throughout your career? Do you feel as though there are different creative freedoms that can be afforded by each medium, or are they fundamentally aiming at the same target?</strong></p>\n<p>For me, the creative process for making music and sculpture are the same. The way I approach working with sound, wood, even the way I write text is all very similar. Since a sculptural process implies a hands-on shaping of material, I usually find that is the best way for me to describe my process. I work sculpturally with sound.</p>\n<p>Traditional sculpture is a part of my artistic career. I majored in sculpture in school, and have always been drawn to working with my hands. I felt for a long time that my visual art and my music were separate creative paths. Some people suggested I combine the two, but it never felt right. I didn’t see a connection and I wasn’t going to force one. But when I started playing with circuit building, I was instantly fascinated with the physical manipulation of electricity, and in particular with the electronics of sound. Exploring the feedback circuits, then building them into wooden instruments, and performing these instruments with voice, and making music with all the sounds….this was a progression that felt very natural and connected to me. In my work right now, there is really no separation between music and sculpture.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m interested in your history with building instruments and machines. Can you tell us a little bit about what exactly you’re doing when you make something? What’s your goal? Where do budding musical engineers start?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m definitely not an engineer! But if you are interested in playing with sound circuits, I think a nice place to start is Nic Collins’ book: Handmade Electronic Music: The Art of Hardware Hacking. As for my history, I have always been attracted to found objects, tinkering, and the art of taking things apart and putting them back together. I love making my instruments because I love working with the found speaker as an object. There is something inherently inspiring to me to have old speakers with a personal history of their own… they come as individuals with imperfections, and real character that can not be reproduced. This is particularly interesting to me as an analogy for human voice.</p>\n<p>I’m the type of person who gets inspired by materials and spaces that already exist.  I think of noise as an invisible material that can be shaped into sound. The noise of feedback has been a particularly rich material for me to work with.  And so much of what makes a sound exciting is the space in which it is produced. I find I’m most creative when I am building sound in beautiful, resonant spaces.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1622066088/size=small/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/track=4055998603/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://lesleyflanigan.bandcamp.com/album/amplifications\">Amplifications by Lesley Flanigan</a></iframe>\n<p><strong>On your website, you say you work with &quot;found&quot; speakers; where/how do you find these speakers, what do you do to them?</strong></p>\n<p>Speakers are everywhere! People sometimes give me speakers. But the best is taking them out of the equipment they were built into. It’s a great feeling to take a speaker out of an old plastic casing and embed it into wood that I cut specifically to fit it. It’s like giving it a new and beautiful home.</p>\n<p><strong>I get the impression that you are more active in the ‘art-world’ than that of music. Is that correct? What keeps you inspired musically if so? What are you listening to these days?</strong></p>\n<p>I feel balanced between the two worlds. Whether my work is received more as art or more as music is mostly a matter of context. What people find interesting is often whatever is different from normal. So typically, presenting my work in a music venue tends to highlight the “art” side of my work, whereas presenting my work in an art venue tends to highlight the music side.</p>\n<p>My inspirations for music are also contextual. Sometimes I find inspiration in music with overwhelming, pulsing bass, and other times, it’s the considered silence between sounds. Sometimes just thinking about the compositional choices an artist makes in their music is most inspiring. For example, the decision that a moment in music should be only 30 seconds long, or should last a full hour -  that kind of attentiveness is fascinating.</p>\n<p>While I was working on “Voices”, I couldn’t listen much to anything for months. I was so engaged with figuring our my sound, that I didn’t want to be led off course, distracted in any way. However, there were a few times that I really needed to listen to music, in order to clear my head and address some of the compositional problems I was having from a new perspective. I listened to music that expressed simplicity and unabashed beauty, including Arvo Pärt, Satie (Gymnopedies), David Lang (Child), and Nyoka Musango (performed by Lora Chiorah-Dye and Sukutai).  This was the kind of music I needed to help open my ears while I was working on this particular piece. I also listened to frogs… I don’t know what kind of frogs are in the New York countryside, but they are amazing in the spring time as they sing huge, loud choruses of repetitive harmony and dissonance. Incredible sounds.</p>\n<p><strong>In a recent interview, you talk about voice being the only pure analog instrument. Can you expand a little on what you meant by this? Are there artists or pieces that particularly inspires you to work in the medium of voice?</strong></p>\n<p>I don’t have a particular inspiration for working with voice. For as long as I can remember, I have loved voice and have loved singing with my voice. I’ve never thought about it, I just do it. The immediacy and intuitiveness of singing makes it a very natural, creative tool for me. Voice is the freedom I have to walk into a space with no equipment at all and simply make sound, make music, and have it work and be inspiring.  I don’t have to troubleshoot my singing. I don’t have to carry any equipment, or unravel any cables, find clean power, set up electronics, etc. For me, voice is an amazing, powerful tool I can enjoy creating with anywhere, anytime.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/59185563?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"550\" height=\"309\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>It's been thirty years since Berlin Atonal truly began. Walking from the U-Bahn to my hostel I pass SO36; the indigenous home to the festival during the '80s. Considering it's the club where it all started where acts like Test Dept, Psychic TV and Einstürzende Neubauten gave incendary performances during their most pioneering moments, it doesn't look like much. It's cartoonish blue sign looks faintly ridiculous sandwiched between shops and severely underwhelming in the face of Atonal's new setting on Köpenicker Straße - a colossal building used as a heating generator prior to the collapse of the Berlin Wall. The literally named 'Kraftwerk' (power plant) has housed Atonal since its rejuvenation in 2013, yet the industrial, DIY ethos of SO36 felt as foundational as ever at this year's Atonal.</p>\n<p>Stepping into Kraftwerk's cavernous main hall we were greeted by Chor Der Kulturen Der Welt, a panorama of choral vocals echoing around the concrete chamber. As the first act to perform, the group showcased the space perfectly, small ensembles of vocalists poised at different points around the upper hall, voices crossing one another in a disorienting barrage of call and response.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5718/20922921312_0003c8cf22_b.jpg\" alt=\"lights\"></p>\n<p>In essence I would be happy seeing anyone or anything in this space; it's vast columns of exposed concrete and imposing, angular design makes Kraftwerk feel like an adventure just to stand in. This year, several other spaces had been opened up - you could wander down to the lower chambers and find yourself in the midst of strobing tubular lights or watching thick black oil pouring down a concrete sheet. Even if the broad array of visual installations amounted to little more than interesting selfie-settings for many, the multi-platformed extension of Atonal's aesthetic went a long way to make Atonal feel like a more rounded experience: you left the festival with memories beyond the music.</p>\n<p>For the first few days at least, many of the acts seemed to be paying homage to the architecture of the building itself. From Chra's mix of crater-rumbling atmospherics and deep sea groans to the swelling shockwaves that Fis vapoured out into the room, it was difficult to imagine what Kraftwerk would be like silent. These sounds seemed as inherent to Kraftwerk as the dust which cakes its floor, or the cool, damp smell which fills the air.</p>\n<p>The integration of other venues housed within the same building helped to counterbalance the homogeneity of the space, and provided some of the most interesting music of the week. For example, DJ Scotch Egg's set of trip-hop breaks and fuzz-caked dubstep at the Ohm stage made a particularly welcome break from the ominous soundscapes upstairs. Playing alongside scratch DJs, visual programmers and an MC conjouring up multisyllabic rhymes that would put Doseone to shame, there was a refreshing lightheartedness to Scotch Egg's set after a few hours of chin-stroking. I guess given the artist name we should never have expected him to take himself too seriously, however it still brought a smile to my face, as did seeing him later, cooking at one of the food stalls between being accosted by fans. Tapes also made use of Ohm's counter-space, churning out unexpected gems of crunchy lo-fi reggae and jungle.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/782/20745890399_b3f90efda2_b.jpg\" alt=\"scotchegg\">\n<em>DJ Scotch Egg &amp; Friends</em></p>\n<p>The Diagonal showcase hosted at the basement Null Stage came with similar theatricality. Blood Music for instance was another clear highlight, hammering away incessantly at a bass drum and snare with a murderous look in his eye. At one point, a drum stick flew towards an unfortunate heckler mid-track without missing a beat. We didn't hear from him again. As the set progressed, Blood Music's percussive battering became increasingly frantic, leaving the audience reeling in its wake and begging for more. Puce Mary too did nothing short of gloriously terrifying her audience, flinging herself from one side of the stage to the other and screaming incomprehensible mantras at ear-bleeding pitches, ascending into an almost unbearable wall of noise towards the end.</p>\n<p>Perhaps one of Atonal's most attractive features is the free entrance to its after-parties at the world famous Tresor. Without exploring firsthand its dark red labyrinth of tunnels before being crammed into the main chamber where the walls drip with sweat, it's hard to put into words why the club has the status that it does. However, one can only imagine the power and intensity that a 6am set from Regis would hold there.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://s86.photobucket.com/user/georgemc25/media/e4632da1-eed8-437b-9176-b8123d53aa0c_zpsk0oxmyqp.jpg.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k114/georgemc25/e4632da1-eed8-437b-9176-b8123d53aa0c_zpsk0oxmyqp.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\" photo e4632da1-eed8-437b-9176-b8123d53aa0c_zpsk0oxmyqp.jpg\"/></a>\n<em>Puce Mary</em></p>\n<p>After bear-hugging Russell Haswell multiple times across his disorientating mix of mangled techno, squelching acid and drone metal, Diagonal label head Powell took to the decks with equal enthusiasm. Listeners of his NTS show will know Powell isn't too po faced an artist either, spreading multiple genres across his set and managing to retain a sense of fun as he did similarly across his hyperactive live set the following day.</p>\n<p>The festival had a definitively less exclusively electronic focus to its previous years. As if to cement Atonal's legacy, we were also treated to a screening of Parisian filmmaker Amelie Revalac's recent documentary on the history of industrial music, 'Industrial Soundtrack for the Urban Decay'. Furthermore, we were also graced with a performance of the legendary and hugely influential Outside the Dream Syndicate, a collaboration between Tony Conrad and Faust. A single chord was maintained for the entire performance, as meshes of clashing strings and marching rhythms slowly intensified. As different elements came together OTDS's acoustic drone grew locked into a hypnagogic trance, growing to a cacophonous climax.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5815/20311691503_9352866327_b.jpg\" alt=\"dream\">\n<em>Tony Conrad</em></p>\n<p>Shackleton followed later also tailoring his performance to something less exclusively electronic. Performing alongside three drummers, cascading rhythms pounded alongside featherlight melodies and ethereal, skittering soundscapes. This world premier of his Powerplant project showcased an inspiring evolution from his Music for the Quiet Hour, and established Atonal as a festival focused on the new and unexpected. Both the Shed and High High sets are also highly worthy of mention. It was a joy to witness a veteran of Berlin techno treat us to some of his greatest contributions, including potential anthem of the decade, 'Rave'.</p>\n<p>After Saturday night at Tresor, many audience members could be found sprawled across the floor, basking in the delicate tones of Ben Frost. His broad soundscapes felt like a giant metallic sheet passing over the audience, and as the week came to a close, we were encouraged to reflect on the bizarre and multifaceted nature of the venue and the festival itself. This time round it became clear that Atonal is far from being canalised into simply one kind of event. The successors who have inherited the festival from Hegemann have a bigger vision in mind; one that is inclusive of all styles reaching towards a similar aesthetic. With the increased focus on visual arts and film this year, it would be interesting to see how this develops, pushing Atonal to explore new and unexpected mediums.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5775/20744911728_687a89e4b8_b.jpg\" alt=\"end\"></p>\n",

    "content": "<p>With every passing year, the work of Joe Higgins seems to get steadily more abstracted. Most will know him by his Metrist moniker, a project focused on half-broken, dusty industrial techno. This time however, the abstraction has reached a kind of breaking point, and we have hence seen the birth of L.sae, a more experimental, scatterbrained and boundary pushing project altogether.</p>\n<p>The first line of William Gibson’s Cyberpunk Sci-Fi novel ‘Neuromancer’ reads,“[t]he sky above the port was the colour of television, tuned to a dead channel.” The American Philosopher Rick Roderick describes this as “the best first sentence in 20th century American literature” for it’s depiction of what he calls “the postmodern trajectory” towards alienation, indifference and pseudo-experience. These themes may also be found in this EP, which itself feels lifeless in comparison to his previous work. The textures are like that of a TV that has had its picture saturation slowly deadened from its original technicolour, and every sonic element feels slightly unhinged from the others. ‘The West as it Will Be’, for example, offers warped spectrogram harmonics and dulled chimes, not as lively, flamboyant flourishes, but as barren, hollowed-out excesses. ’Line Sunk Like I’m Sunk’, too, feels purposeless and incomplete; we are left only with fragments of what sounds like a mangled cassette tape.</p>\n<p>The whole EP is also never quite comfortable sitting in one place at one time. At points, metallic hats are slashing their way through the mix in a groovy shuffle. At others, there is bouncy interplay of sub and percussive clunks. Sometimes there is nothing but the granulated hiss of static. Each block of ideas has the potential for their own unique formation, but instead, Higgins lays them out in a tattered tapestry of sounds for us to enjoy, and it works magnificently well.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/218582813&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>The Dead Fader project has mutated quite a bit since it's origins. Originally a collaboration between John Cohen &amp; Barry Prendergast, the duo's early material mediated distortion drenched dubstep with static-heavy, bitfucked techno and noise.</p>\n<p>Since taking the project solo however, Cohen has eased the project to something less tinnitus inducing - albeit gradually. Perhaps the biggest signifier of this came from <em>Deaf Arena</em>, a solo LP released under his own name of smouldering ambient soundscapes. Last year we were also treated to a double release of LPs from the Dead Fader project, <em>Scorched</em> harking back to the earlier, more roughtrod Dead Fader Sound, and <em>Blood Forest</em> exploring haunting tape-warbled soundtracks for an imaginary film.</p>\n<p>With a new LP due out on Robot Elephant shortly, we decided to catch up with Cohen to discuss Sci-Fi,  the digital revolution and the beauty of imperfection.</p>\n<p><strong>So what’s your connection to Brighton? You living here before moving to Berlin right?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah I was living here for about six years, I like coming back to Brighton but it feels as if the club scene has kind of plateaued recently, I don’t know has it? Maybe that’s just because the press is so London-centric, it can sometime seem like that’s the only place where music is happening. I grew up in Bedford and there’s basically nothing there, it’s really shit. There was a couple of people making some really weird breakbeat but that was it.</p>\n<p><strong>I guess that’s the thing with those insular towns — you end up getting quite weird music coming out pure because you have a lot of people with nothing else to do than sit in their bedrooms making weird music on their computers.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah in Bedford I started really young, my brother used to work at the studio in his University and we stole the installation discs for Reason and Cubase et cetera. I guess when you start making music at like 12, your influences are ultimately limited to pop music. I started off making this cheesy chillout and drum &amp; bass and then when I was about 15 it changed a bit; a friend of my brother heard some of the stuff I was making and said “oh you should check out Squarepusher…” so I went completely mad on Squarepusher basically. Then I started getting into static noise stuff before going off to clubs and hearing dubstep on massive sound-systems. I don’t think anyone who went to those early dubstep nights didn’t take something from them. It had a mega impact.</p>\n<p><strong>I remember first going to those nights and having the realisation that sub existed - it wasn’t that I didn’t think synths were capable of low frequencies, but I’d never really heard them used creatively before.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah it was the physical presence of the bass too; you didn’t really have to dance, you could just move to the bass, and that was the thing the really influenced me. It was the first time I had really heard live music sounding that powerful.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/215856865&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>What kind of stuff do you feature in your live set at the moment?</strong></p>\n<p>I try and keep it quite current to be honest, playing stuff I’ve made in the last couple of weeks. The last thing I want to happen is to get bored on stage. It depends on the context too, sometimes I want to play soundscape-y stuff but sometimes a promoter will book me to play at a party so I sometimes just go along with the party vibe now and then.</p>\n<p><strong>We were watching the Loplop thing before we got here with C_C, how did you make contact with him?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh yeah his music is amazing. We did a recording together in Paris and I think of everyone that I’ve worked with in the past, I get the best results with him. The Loplop stuff is all hardware, like drum machines. I do more digital stuff now, like with the new record, pretty much all the sounds are made using hardware, but the effects were all digital. I’ve been buying bits of hardware for a couple of years now - I’m not very technical so it took me a while to get used to them, but I love the sound of them. There’s no syncing or sequencing, and you make a lot of mistakes with them, which is really inspirational.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e8ynP7yWqjI?rel=0&controls=0&showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>You can drive yourself crazy editing stuff on a laptop too - it’s nice to have a cutoff point when you’ve recorded something that marks the end of practicing the piece or whatever.</strong></p>\n<p>Oh yeah that’s bullshit - even with the laptop I would try and replicate the live sound as much as possible; record it in, make a couple edits then I’m done. I really don’t like overproduced electronic music, the scene is flooded with it and it’s too perfect — I can hear perfect music instantly and it bores me. I see music as being all about capturing energy: if you spend five months on a track, then all the energy is dispersed into different places and you totally lose that ‘of the moment’ feel that is so central. A lot of the overproduced stuff comes from a place where people feel pressured to make generic music with an intro or a drop et cetera but you don’t need any of that.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you have a time limit on your tracks?</strong></p>\n<p>No the track takes as long as the track takes. But I always find the ones that takes just 20 minutes are the best ones because they work in every aspect and all the elements come together. Ultimately, you’ve taken a snapshot of musical energy and it’s all contained in this simple piece. Sometimes I find myself struggling with loads of tracks for weeks and out of nowhere you’ll make something in ten minutes that’s way better than anything that has taken you a couple of weeks work.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/705/21036851741_4638310d3d_b.jpg\" alt=\"cohen\"></p>\n<p><strong>I personally quite like it when you hear mistakes or sounds that shouldn’t be there. Like with vinyl or whatever, the pitch warbling technically shouldn’t be there but it’s a nice sound.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah same goes for tape — so many people try and replicate that tape warble now, like the Boards of Canada sound, it’s really beautiful. I find the whole digital/vinyl debate so ridiculous anyway because the quality of a vinyl doesn’t sound ‘better’, it can sound ‘pleasing’ sure but people get confused about it, it’s just taste.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m into 192kbps' myself.</strong></p>\n<p>(Laughs) Yeah that’s the thing, digital distortion and the sounds we don’t like with digital files now will probably be replicated widely in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>I remember reading Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine saying about their new album and how it doesn’t really make sense to press something digital to wax.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah exactly if you’re going to be a purest about it, do it from the start. I feel like in the digital era too, everything is quite transient; you can’t hold on to artefacts in the same way, and we feel nostalgic about those objects. So the revival of vinyl is an effort to go back to that feeling again I think.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m having a recurring argument with my flatmate because I have some of my 12”s in a frame, and he was like “why are you putting a record on the wall? It wasn't designed for that.”</strong></p>\n<p>But it was because you have the beautiful artwork that someone has thought hard about.</p>\n<p><strong>Yeah, his response was ‘why don’t you put a jam jar on the wall? Someone’s thought hard about that too’. I sort of understand his point, but… he’s a dick. (laughs)</strong></p>\n<p>I don’t know if I do get his point, sometimes I check out an album just because I like the artwork. Why not buy a fucking record and stick it on your wall? I don’t like that militancy about what you can or can’t do with a product. I’m also not so sure that vinyl really is having a resurgence, you know. Because it’s a bit trendy at the moment, there’s loads of major artists releasing stuff on vinyl that wouldn’t have before, so on the whole it looks like sales are going up, but I’m not sure if it’s really the resurgence that people are making out in the underground scene.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/220781588&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>You can buy vinyl from places like Urban Outfitters now , so I bet a significant chunk of the sales are coming from those places now too.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah exactly — and Record Store Day is a weird marketing ploy too. I’m not sure if it’s true that there has been this spike in sales for small shops recently. It also annoys me that the media tend to only review vinyl releases. It seems like people still don’t recognise releases as valuable if they’re a free download. There’s an attitude that if it’s been pressed to vinyl, then it must be worth something, at least. That is so backward I think.</p>\n<p><strong>What things have influenced your new record?</strong></p>\n<p>I don’t know really, maybe it’s too soon to tell what has been influencing me. But when I was making it, I was getting all kinds of images in my head. I think it’s quite a cinematic feel to it, quite a spacey Sci-Fi feel.</p>\n<p><strong>Are you into Sci-Fi?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh yeah I’m a massive Sci-Fi geek, and the funny thing is I only just realised in the last couple of years. I’m not into watching Star Trek all the time, which I guess is the stereotypical idea of a Sci-Fi geek, but all of my favorite films and animes and the imagery that I seek out it all tends towards Sci-Fi stuff. I don’t really know why…</p>\n<p><strong>I feel like Sci-Fi — particularly anime — and electronic music have certain things in common. Like they’re both heavily mediated by computers and there is an attitude of exacting the idea you have in your head, being very precise with your editing and so on. Whereas other films that use cameras I guess are more susceptible to ‘real world’ variations.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah I think you’re right. I think Sci-Fi also gives you a big scope for imagination; you can create things that are heavily abstract, which is a quality I look for in music too.</p>\n<p><strong>I suppose Sci-Fi and ambient music both aim to create atmosphere at the end of the day. Have you ever tried scoring a film with your own ambient stuff?</strong></p>\n<p>I’ve been wanting to do it for the last couple of years. I’d love to do it with something new but I don’t know any amazing directors, so I’d like to try my hand at re-scoring something. I was massively into that Interstellar film. A lot of people thought it was cheesy but a couple of months after I saw it I found myself constantly thinking about it and that’s when I knew it was a great film. I’d love to score that or some anime like Akira. But I guess the problem with that is that you’re in really dangerous waters because the soundtracks are already fucking amazing and everyone knows it. Ben Frost did that recently, re-scoring Solaris. I think if I was going to do it I would definitely do it for a film where I knew the music had something to be desired. Otherwise you’re just fighting a losing battle.</p>\n<p><strong>How has being in Berlin shaped your musical output? It’s obviously a very club-oriented city but your stuff is moving away from that. Do you feel isolated musically?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah I think I’ve always been a bit isolated to be fair. I’ve always been a bit of an outsider. There is some great stuff going on in Berlin, but part of the problem is that there’s just so much stuff there that you can get easily lost or spread out across all the different scenes. There’s a lot of techno and house so if you’re into that then it’s awesome and it’s a great place to be.</p>\n<p><strong>I suppose back in the '80s and '90s house and techno was quite avant-garde music but now it’s all over the place. It’s weird to think of somewhere like the Berghain now being mainstream.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah it totally is — I got a real sense of it when I was on a flight to Berlin and I was chatting with some random guy on the flight, and he was talking about Berghain and I realised that it’s now a tourist-y super-club for most people. But the interesting thing about it is that they have this crazy door policy. It’s essentially still a gay club: they don’t let everyone in, and you hear all these stories about tourists going there and getting turned away which is kind of funny.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yMg3iYSgU38?rel=0&controls=0&showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Earlier this month, we caught up with Shelley Parker, a producer who has sustained a level of mystery about her work despite the heightened level of hype surrounding it. Her ‘Spurn Point’ album has garnered quite a bit of attention since its release last year, including support from Manni Dee, Chra and Pearson Sound. &quot;That album took a while to produce and was fairly complicated due to the tracks being sourced from different times, spaces, and live projects rather than a straight ahead set of studio tracks&quot; she tells us. &quot;I didn’t really send it out to anyone for review – I’d achieved what I wanted with it and since then I’ve been able to work on other things&quot;.</p>\n<p>You may also know her as label head of the STRUCTURE imprint, &quot;Structure is a label/event project I set up in 2007. Originally it was going to be a kind of dance label as after DJing since 2001 that felt like the next step. I put on several Structure events at the former T Bar with artists like Radioactive Man, Billy Nasty, Portable, Warlock, Sync 24 – basically the people I knew from London through playing out&quot; she explains. One thing that is particularly notable about Parker's work is that she comes from a history rich in noise and industrial sounds. &quot;It’s a funny one as I think I’m often associated with noise/industrial and perhaps more abstract sounds where as I’ve always worked with rhythmic/percussive stuff so I don’t really know where this idea has come from!&quot; She continues, &quot;having DJed before in particular early dubstep circa 2003 and some of the emerging breaks stuff that came out around 2005 this music was not only a huge influence on my DJ sets but consequently production style. Since 1997 all my gallery based projects, music production and performances owe more to dance music in particular drum and bass/dubstep/techno than say Stockhausen! I’m often invited to play in more experimental environments which neither have adequate sound systems or where it’s appropriate to hammer it anyway so yes this perception of my work it’s definitely something I’m aware of&quot;.</p>\n<p>Recorded on the 31st July, Shelley's mix for us is a one-take mash up of old, new and unreleased crunchy techno. &quot;I always used to record DJ mixes in this way and although it’s more of a challenge it’s much more fun and there’s of course a “live” element which you simply don’t achieve when just auditioning tracks on a computer&quot;. You can also catch Parker at Corsica Studios on November 6th playing live alongside Objekt, Peder Mannefelt and Ancient Methods, or at Towards Collapse on the 14th hosted at Power Lunches. &quot;I’m really looking forward to both as they have great sound systems and I will have the opportunity to play a proper live set in a club for a change which will be ace!&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist</strong></p>\n<p>Shelley Parker – Catch [Opal Tape]<br>\nPhuture Pfantasy Club – Spank Spank [Trax]<br>\nPris – Bogano [Opal Tapes]<br>\nConvextion – Miranda [Matrix]<br>\nJames Ruskin – Massk [Blueprint]<br>\nMathew Johnson – She is He [Itiswhatitis]<br>\nERP – Vox Automaton [Frustrated Funk]<br>\nCoil – The Snow (As pure as Remix) [Torso]<br>\nUntold – Drop it on the One [Hemlock]<br>\nSurgeon – Force + Form Remakes 1 [Tresor]<br>\nManni Dee – Pascal’s Gambit [Leyla]<br>\nConsequence – Dubounce [Exit]<br>\nNormaling – Full Metal (House of Black Lanterns Remix) [Seclusiasis]<br>\nWarlock – It’s in my brain [Dirty Needles]<br>\nAirsilk – Smooth Coal Rental [Unreleased]<br>\nToni Quiroga – Untitled [Unreleased]<br>\nTruss – Wyefield [Perc]<br></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?embed_type=widget_standard&embed_uuid=8e52240f-271b-4f46-95a9-e165477f0faa&feed=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0050-shelley-parker%2F&hide_cover=1&hide_tracklist=1&replace=0\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><div style=\"clear: both; height: 3px; width: auto; \"></div><p style=\"display: block; font-size: 11px; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 3px; padding-right: 4px; padding-bottom: 3px; padding-left: 4px; color: rgb(153, 153, 153); width: auto; \"><a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/0050-shelley-parker/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=base_links&utm_term=resource_link\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:#808080; font-weight:bold;\">0050 // Shelley Parker</a><span> by </span><a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=base_links&utm_term=profile_link\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:#808080; font-weight:bold;\">Stray Landings</a><span> on </span><a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=base_links&utm_term=homepage_link\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:#808080; font-weight:bold;\"> Mixcloud</a></p><div style=\"clear: both; height: 3px; width: auto; \"></div>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Rakutaro</em></p>\n<p>It seems as if coding is a bit of a hot topic at the moment. Many of the artists working under the banner of post- or even post-post-Internet have been using code to program algorithms and manipulate data sets, and the function of computer code has itself become aestheticised in many ways. This obsession is in fact nothing new or even niche as an idea. Earlier this month at Cafe OTO, I saw AGF perform a poem rapping out long strings of code. Ryoji Ikeda has also been touring his various projects related to data, visually and sonically based on his experiences as CERN. Jasmine Guffond too has played with this idea, with her 'Sound Selfies' that create music from facial recognition software. Furthermore, conceptual artist Lars TCF Holdus has been doing pioneering work in bringing code into art; spontaneously generating algorithmically produced art and sound, and incorporating other elements such as his own genetic code.</p>\n<p>In Tokyo, coding in music has taken on an added improvisational dimension. At the hyped basement venue SuperDeluxe, an evening of live coding has been taking place called Beyond Code. This time around, we were treated to performances from sound art duo Reshaft and Stray Landings signee Yu Miyashita with live A/V from motion graphics collective, BRDG. During Reshaft, BRDG plastered graphically morphed faces and symbols over three walls, as Reshaft pumped hyperengineered sound effects in and out of the mix. There's something akin in this music to the sheen and HD quality of D'n'B subgenre, Neurofunk. Frequencies are played at the very periphery of human hearing, but only for a split second before there's time to fully examine them. The final performance consisted of a live coding performance by Akihiro Kubota, based on coding theories of both Iannis Xenakis &amp; György Ligeti. This in turn was EQ'd and musically manipulated by Yu Miyashita. The sounds themselves were super-dry, like the sound of a spectrogram output, with every note on a keyboard held down at once. There were also what sounded like sirens and a never ending Shepard Tone, adding yet more layers to the confusing but joyous cacophony. Watching code being spelt out in front of your very eyes brought to mind the DIY ethos of early punk rock. Even if you hadn't a clue how exactly the coding worked, there was nonetheless a full disclosure about how it could be done, and with enough examination, anyone could do the same.</p>\n<p>In David Novak's book, <em>Japanoise: Music at the Edge of Circulation</em>, he discusses the nature of feedback. Inputs are plugged and replugged into other inputs and outputs, creating a whirling orbit of chaotic sound and information. In Japanoise, this feedback was created using enormous tables of fuzzboxes, and placing microphones next to speakers to create apocalyptic screeches that sound like a mechanical hell. Novak argues that this became representative of &quot;how a mechanical society feeds human energy back into the machine and measure[s] just how deeply creative subjectivity has become embedded in this cycle.” Now then, it appears as if the madness of the cycle is manifest through computerised feedback loops of data; constantly regurgitated through different methods of digitisation. With so many artists exploring the sonic and aesthetic possibilities of code, it feels as though we are watching the baby-steps for a much larger leap forward in the way we think about electronic music production. However, if we want to know how and where the truly groundbreaking work will occur, we ought to keep our eyes dead set on Tokyo and Beyond Code.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/221553014&amp;color=5f5f5f&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Robert T is good with maths. Working as an air traffic controller, the profession he held for 20 years, you kind of have to be. His latest project 'Miasma', a three track cassette for Burn Ward Records makes this clear - sequenced rhythms dancing around one another with increasing complexity.</p>\n<p>There has always seemed to be an inclination towards extended tracks with Robert T, as with this release, he often records his tracks in single takes. 'Miasma' however feels like the first recorded work of his I feel has truly explored the limits of this idea. The first track occupies a languid 30 minutes, followed by two further experiments which both last (give or take a little) ten minutes. This in itself throws up some interesting ideas. As always the sound feels carefully regimented with each element strictly fixed in place - however the extended lengths push Robert T to explore something more malleable. The result is that the tracks here have a psychedelic, improvisational quality to them, vaguely calling to mind the likes of Tangerine Dream or Klaus Schulze's extended synth experiments.</p>\n<p>The release is built around a-side offering 'Miasma' - twitching percussion and pointed arpeggios tiptoeing between one another. All this cemented by Robert T's fixture-rattling booms of low-end - yet many of the beats are left implied, giving 'Miasma' a lethargic swing. Your mind is left to fill in the blanks.</p>\n<p>Following this the moon-walking 'Mikrospace' floats weightlessly, as plaintive soundscapes swell in the background, dripping sound-design and '70s electronica synth glides listlessly. 'Shiva' closes with drowsy, plodding techno. The track sounds like it could be cut from the Sandwell District catalogue, although listened to through several layers of concrete - indistinct and dreamlike.</p>\n<p>With 'Miasma' Robert T seems to have hit on a blueprint extremely complementary to his style, of which I look forward to hearing explored further.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3194854690/size=small/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/artwork=none/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://robertt.bandcamp.com/album/miasma\">Miasma by Robert T</a></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Despite the fact his releases have only emerged over the past year, Giovanni Napoli aka Somec has been honing his craft with modular systems for some time. When we spoke with him earlier this month, he revealed his love affair with all things hardware began over a decade ago. &quot;I think it happened around 2002-2003&quot; he begins. &quot;During that time I was listening to a lot of noise - things like Cabaret Voltaire, CAN, Einstürzende Neubauten, Clock DVA... I was very attracted by the electronic sounds often felt in those production. One night in Lecce I saw an ambient live set from two guys called Mono Watt, they used only synths and drum machines... Wow. I think it was the first time I saw those strange machines running so close to me, It was love at first sight. A few months later I bought my first drum machine - a used Yamaha RM1x and I started to play. An obsession was born. It took years of practice for me to reach a sound identity - I was tied to analog stuff because it was easy to use, sounded good and never crashes like a PC.&quot;</p>\n<p>Even Napoli's day job is tied up with hardware - he is a buyer for an Italian pro audio importer, buying the machines he produces with 'compulsively'. Whilst this may be an expensive hobby, Napoli's productions have not gone unrecognised - he has become a repeat fixture on Milan based imprint Haunter Records. When asked about his first contact with label head's Daniele and Francesco, Napoli reveals the relationship developed rather naturally. &quot;Well we hung out at the same places and listened to the same music, so sooner or later we were going to meet. One night I met Daniele and Birsa at a bar - there was something that united us. We shared the same attitude towards music. Above all, they had the right music culture and sensibility to fully appreciate my works. I had never sent my tracks around and I did not want to do it to be honest, but Haunter Records was the perfect place to give birth to Somec. From then we started to work together on various musical projects, doing stuff for culture and not for trends. Everything has been consolidated at Macao (an abandoned slaughterhouse) which has become our second home. Something great was happening, something true - pure future for Milan.&quot;</p>\n<p>Releasing his second EP for the label 'Source Of Uncertainty' a couple of months back, it may be a surprise to those familiar with the record the speed at which Napoli constructed it. When asked about the composition he told me he hadn't worked on the tracks for more than six hours overall. &quot;Most of the tracks were recorded in the studio in December 2014&quot; he add. &quot;I was on holiday in Lecce (my hometown in the very south of Italy). There is not much to do in these wastelands - wake up early and go fishing in the morning and then spend rest of the day segregated in my studio.&quot;</p>\n<p>The lack of arts scene in Lecce is likely what drew Napoli to his current home, Milan, where he has been living for the last ten years. But even there, Napoli says the arts scene has not always been particularly vibrant. &quot;When I arrived in Milan the state of the art in the music field was very bad. Milan is full of mediocre nightclubs populated by Pithecanthropus cavemen. The music is totally overshadowed and only appearance and the car you drive count. At that time the “underground” music was German Minimal Techno (from 2006-2007) - that dry shit without reverbs. The scene worsened dramatically a few years later... from minimal to French touch aka 'Elektro'... Holy shit! Things like Justice and other shit like that come out from that bleeding wound. Fortunately common sense won. Now all that rubbish is a distant memory.&quot;</p>\n<p>Napoli's mix for us covers a disorientatingly wide range of sounds and styles, comprised of tracks made by friends and people Napoli respects for &quot;the contribution they have made to this scene&quot;. He describes the mix as &quot;a climb up to the light - it tells a little of the last sad months of my life.

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Yosuke Hada</em></p>\n<p>Earlier this month, we met up with Yu Miyashita in his hometown of Yamanashi, at the base of Mount Fuji. We sat on the floor at a quiet local Izakaya, waiting for our Sake to arrive, when I ask him about his upcoming projects. Reflecting on the title of his latest record, <em>Homage</em>, he explained that he wanted to express his gratitude to artists, writers and philosophers of the past; Da Vinci, Ionesco, Goethe, Novalis, Shusaku and Ende. “I have a very strong sense of what I want to do in music”, he tells me. “But having this sense means that I am always having struggles in my work, struggles that most people wouldn’t care about. Then at some point in my life, I started thinking  that even if I can’t meet people in the same era that I could express all my thoughts and feelings to, I can still focus on great people from history, and the fact that those people existed has actually helped me in a big way”.</p>\n<p>There’s something that makes perfect sense hearing <em>Homage</em> in the still, sedate environment of Yamanashi. On this record, Miyashita employs his masterful ability at creating musical scenarios, all of which carry with them a kind of, personal, introverted space. ‘To Leonardo’, for example, splits between desolated musique concrète and swelling orchestral flourishes; a kind of musical stream-of-conciousness that one can follow. ’To Novalis’ too, takes on a Basinskian form, laying and overlaying an achingly simple piano loop until it is fully sedimented into the mind. Nonetheless, there is great care taken not to patronise the listener by over-saturating the mix in sentimentality. There are beautiful melodies, but they exist fleetingly, and we hear them only in slivers and remnants.</p>\n<p>Miyashita has a talent for marrying these discrete ideas with swirling cacophonies of noise, creating a powerful sense of battling against the awesome forces of nature. This is especially true for ‘To Michael’, the sister-track to ‘The Silent Pulse’, B-side of our Grind Analysts 12”. In ‘The Silent Pulse’, the rousing vocals penetrated through with clear and distinct clarity. In this rendition however, the chilling chorale takes on a more detached order, haunting the listener in short bursts of deathly hymns.

    "content": "<p>Photo Credit: Laszlo Juhasz</p>\n<p>The music of Dimitra Lazaridou-Chatzigoga is difficult to explain without omitting something essential. Put simply, she brings the traditional folk timbres of the zither into modernist drone structures, often lasting over an hour in the live performances. There are clear nods here to likes of avant-jazz minimalism, and yet the sound is distinctly time-honoured, with woody textures and a lo-tech meditative playing style. At times, the sonic quality of the zither is so small and elusory that it feels as though you have to crane your neck to hear its subtle tones. At others, the harsh, interlocking frequencies are enough to make to make you wince. The dynamics in this music are crucial, and the sonic palette that it possesses for the very small and the very large is truly staggering. We caught up with Lazaridou-Chatzigoga ahead of her performance at Cafe OTO’s seemingly half-built Project Space to talk about John Cage, the Greek financial crisis and electric heaters.</p>\n<p><strong>How would you define the music you play?</strong></p>\n<p>You could call the kind of music I play ‘improvised’ or ‘electro acoustic improvisation’ or ‘experimental’ but I prefer to just call it just music. It’s also experimental in its approach - I don’t play my instrument in a traditional way, and it’s improvised in that I don’t follow a predetermined score. One of the things I care about a lot is texture and the way you can create structure on the spot drawing from your previous practice and the moment when the music is actually happening.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/76523797&color=999999&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>What’s your set up this evening? What is that instrument?</strong></p>\n<p>So my instrument is a zither from Saxony, so a central European zither. I picked it up because it reminded me the inside of a piano but on a portable scale. It has this horizontal structure that invites you to adopt a different perspective than the one you would have with a guitar for instance, where you would normally have it parallel to your body. This horizontality reminded me of the way Keith Rowe used his guitar on a table, enabling him to play the instrument in a new way. I can thus play the strings in new ways and place objects (metallic, wooden, magnetic) on top of them. I also use e-bows, which are electronic bows which magnetically vibrate the strings, a vibration that is extended to the body of the instrument and whatever objects I have on the instrument.</p>\n<p><strong>Would you say then that almost every performance you do is unique? Do you think your music translates better live or as a recording in this regard?</strong></p>\n<p>There are several things that are repeated in my sets such as which objects I use, how I place the instrument itself and so on, but then almost always, I would use the objects in a different order or I would decide to explore that particular sound more in one performance or to work more on a combination of sounds in another. So although I might be using the same ingredients it doesn’t mean it will always come out in the same way. I feel you always discover new things as you play. It’s also important that the audience, the context and the space shape the music played on each occasion. When it comes to recordings, I think the listener can abstract away from the visual details, which are salient in a live performance, and can concentrate more on the quality of the sound.</p>\n<p><strong>Some of the sounds you make almost sound synthesised. It’s interesting how noise artists can be appreciated and arrived at both from the world of electronic music and the avant-garde jazz world but someone coming from one tradition may not know anything about the other. From which tradition would you say you stem from?</strong></p>\n<p>That is an interesting point indeed. People who have listened to my music without having seen how it is performed live have asked me quite a few times if I play some kind of synth. Imagine their reaction when I tell them “I play the zither!” I certainly don’t stem ffrom noise, even though I have listened to it here and there. Avant-garde jazz musicians like Ornette Coleman were a big influence, before even starting to play or perform. Then there are composers like John Cage and Morton Feldman, who have been instrumental in the way I see music. There’s also free improvisation groups like AMM and the way they explore music or the minimalist composer Phil Niblock with his dense multi-layered music. I guess I diverge from electronic music in that my approach starts from the instrument and then goes towards abstract sounds, whereas electronic music may do the opposite. A big influence in that respect is Sachiko M, a Japanese musician who manipulates the internal test tones from her sample as her musical material, a radical approach both to what music sounds like and also to the relation of a musician with their instrument, creating pure ear-piercing sine waves.</p>\n<p><strong>How does the recording process work for your music?</strong></p>\n<p>I often don’t even use a studio – it could be at a house, or in a church. I do like studio time, but it’s often more a case of who will record you – you need someone that is interested in that kind of music, and it’s important that the sound engineer recognises the requirements, which can differ greatly from the ones of other musicians. I remember when we were in Sweden recording a concert at a Jazz festival, the heating was on and it was making a very loud constant noise, and we ended up arguing with them saying ‘this thing is actually making a sound very similar to our sound so you should turn it off!’ and they looked really puzzled.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/76185591&color=a09d9c&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I understand that you’re originally from Greece – what’s the music scene like there? Has your music been received differently here than there?</strong></p>\n<p>I am from Greece, but I started playing when I was in Barcelona and there’s a small scene there for this kind of music, people like Ferran Fages, Alfredo Monteiro and Ruth Barberán. They had been doing concerts for many years so I was very influenced by the way they treat their instruments and the way the scene works there. In Greece, there is a lot of music going on, a lot of things used to happen at the Small Music Theatre in Athens with Nikos Veliotis and Anastasis Grivas organizing, but then because of the situation in Greece now, it is difficult to organize concerts. Plus, a lot of Greek musicians leave Greece to make music and a living elsewhere. I think this kind of music doesn’t really originate from one place; it’s more like a community of people across the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Have you noticed a difference in how the audience responds to this music, say between Barcelona and London?</strong></p>\n<p>I think it depends on how much exposure people have had to this kind of music. Here in London, there is already an audience ready to hear this kind of stuff, where in Greece or in Spain it would be very marginal – sometimes with just 5 people in the audience. The reaction is different here too; in London, I find that people don’t really express what they think after a show. In Greece or other places I played live, people would come up to you when you are finished and ask you ‘how do you do that?’ and they want to know why, but here people are more reserved.</p>\n<p><strong>You spoke about the broad cross-cultural nature of this kind of music. What are some of your non-musical influences?</strong></p>\n<p>I do think this kind of music is very connected to other art forms, especially painting. Recently, I drew a line between Paul Klee’s paintings with some aspects of my music. ‘Stroke by Stroke’ took its name from a poetry collection by the Belgian poet Henri Michaux and my duo album ‘Corgroc’ borrowed lines from an E.E.Cummings poem for the track titles. One of the last projects I did was inspired by Alexander Calder’s mobile structures – the idea of which was to write basic instructions for people and then follow the basic archetype of a mobile structure with its flow and stillness.</p>\n<p><strong>So tell us about the concert tonight, who will you be playing with?</strong></p>\n<p>Tonight I’m playing with Birgit Ulher who’s a trumpet player from Hamburg who I met in Barcelona. She’s just here in London for a few days so we decided to play as a duo, which we’ve never done before. I find her playing really interesting because she’s playing trumpet but also different radio transmitters and she responds to sound in a very peculiar way, so I’m looking forward to seeing how that will pan out. Tonight’s concert will be OTO’s project space around the corner from the café – it’s a really interesting space because you can only fit a few people in there and you can hear different aspects of the environment around it coming through such as the trains.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally, what other plans have you got for the rest of the year?</strong></p>\n<p>I just released a duo CD called ‘Bauchredner’ with Martin Küchen, a saxophonist from Sweden, and we’re currently organising a tour together in some places in Europe. I am also playing with Ute Kanngieser (cello) and Jennifer Allum (violin) regularly working on our trio sound and I am preparing a split solo release with Daichi Yoshikawa, who plays feedback. I also want to work on finding some funds to present the mobile #2 OR odds ratio composition (inspired by Calder) in London, a project with Nate Wooley, Cremaster (Alfredo Costa Monteiro and Ferran Fages), Xavier Charles, Enrico Malatesta and Christian Weber.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/105746879?color=f5f5f5&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"575\" height=\"323\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Considering they first started working together way back in 2011, Oto Hiax have managed to stay pretty tight-lipped over the last four years. The project is partnership between Black Acre regular, Scott Gordon aka Loops Haunt and founder of organic ambient/techno outfit Seefeel, Mark Clifford.  Their debut EP, titled simply 'EP 1', treads the middle-ground between the two parties remarkably effectively. Featuring some of the skippy, broken UK rhythms you might expect to hear in Loops Haunt material alongside the shoegaze ambience that Seefeel became so well versed at, the EP explores some fairly space-leaning material, without ever straying too far into awe-struck-Brian-Cox style indulgences.</p>\n<p>This is perhaps due to the fact Oto Hiax's organic melodic elements are put in heavy contrast with data-mosh soundscapes. Take 'Roaming Folds' for example - as faded guitar flourishes cut through a veil of reverb,  granular engine sounds whiz past in the backdrop. 'Lark', perhaps the EP's pinnacle is further case in point, glistening melodies sharply offset by a skism of code-string breaks - digitalised kicks tumbling over each other maniacally.</p>\n<p>Similarly fractured timbres are employed across 'Migrator', darkweb glitches and smog-caked bass hits grating against Oto Hiax's clicking, kitchen-ware snares and skin-crawling atmospheres. The track's close sees these contrasting elements give way to an expanse of melancholic soundscapes, before lumbering closer, 'Sleeplocks'. The track crawls like vapour from blackened chasms, whistling atmospherics hinting at life in the depths.</p>\n<p>As a debut written four years ago, 'EP 1' sounds remarkably current and makes an interesting development for both artists. Needless to say given the time that has passed since Clifford &amp; Gordon put this EP together their sensibilities have likely developed significantly, however even in this first release they have found an intriguing niche amongst their fellow Brighton-noise contemporaries.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=96281780/size=small/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/artwork=none/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://otohiax.bandcamp.com/album/one\">One by Oto Hiax</a></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p><em>Batch 0001</em> sees the return of SM-LL signee, Durusin, and an exciting new installation in their nascent Batch series. R.E.C’s <em>Batch 0000</em> was hyper-restrained with it’s 1-track-4-speed format, but this latest release is generous with its individual tracks with a total of 5 available for the digital edition. What makes the Batch series different from the previous Default series is the introduction of vinyl format to the label roster. Indeed, the clear vinyl of the Batch series needs to be seen to be believed. The clear grooves and pristine glimmer of the object itself makes it seem as if it were cut to crystal rather than vinyl. In the words of label boss Martin Thompson, “there’s nothing better than seeing your world through clear vinyl”.</p>\n<p>Followers of SM-LL will recognise Durusin from <em>Default 0001</em>, one of the first releases to come out of the label. Here, Durusin brought geometric song structures and stirring simplicity to dub techno. Last year, we also saw a more abstracted dimension to his sound on the Venus EP for An Epic. <em>Batch 0001</em> sees something of a marriage between these two styles, attempting to expand the borders of dub as far as they can stretch.</p>\n<p>Opening with ‘Ferusks’, for example, one can hear the amplified tape hiss of analogue hardware. Where most producers would seek to erase this extrinsic mechanical rumble, Durusin embraces it as its own musical device. However, it’s ’Wazzld’ that highlights the imaginative scope of the release. The track itself is compelling, but it’s hard to pinpoint why. There are off-beat stabs of robotic vocoder and what comprises the rest of the piece is crunched-out noises and super-dry sine waves. What then, gives this track its energy? Jazz Pianist Vijay Iyer once wrote that music with groove can “sustain interest or attention for long stretches of time to an acculturated listener, even if ‘nothing is happening’ on the musical surface”. Dub like that of <em>Batch 0001</em> is a perfect example; even with the scarcest musical material, this could never be described as static.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2477902836/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=1220753695/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://sm-ll.bandcamp.com/album/durusin-batch-0001\">Durusin - Batch 0001 by Durusin</a></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Anne Tetzlaff</em></p>\n<p>Beatrice Dillon’s <em>Face A/B</em> continues her project of carrying out musical experimentation through the medium of techno, which she describes as ‘the most interesting music now’. Classically trained, and previously having released work with the composer Rupert Clervaux titled <em>Studies I-XVII For Samplers And Percussion</em>, this is not the sterile or academic music one might expect. 'Face A' begins with a bass line that stutters the EP into motion, belying the typical role of such low frequencies as providing a firm ground for the rest of the musical movement. Even the kick seems uncertain of itself, hesitant of an easy break into a four-to-the-floor pattern.</p>\n<p>However, such initial tentativeness is part of the play throughout the EP between freedom and control, improvisation and automation. As soon as the kick drum and distorted bass fall into a steady, recognisable pattern we hear the atonal squealings of an improvised saxophone, as if a Free Jazz era Ornette Coleman were trapped inside the snap-to-grid layout of a DAW. The jazz influence is refreshing, particularly against the current trend for hyper-produced, darkly mechanical techno. As a recent Facebook status by Levon Vincent complained, ‘can a guy get a 7th chord once and again?’. The first track bubbles and foams into moments of what seems like improvisatory madness, but as it pares itself down to the essential elements by the end, you begin to realise there was always method in it.</p>\n<p>The second track is a variation on the themes of the first -  as denoted by the title, 'Face B' - which sees its elements succumbing to more control on the part of the producer. Beginning with stable, metronomic clicks and gentle syncopated dub chord stabs, the saxophone returns, though rather than showcasing a desperate attempt for freedom over the necessity of the rhythm, it seems more to seep into the track, this time heavily processed by Dillon.</p>\n<p>The final track 'Sonnier (A Walk in the Light)' dispenses with the elements present in the first two, but nevertheless maintains the same danceable weirdness. At odds with its title, this piece presents a rather murky soundscape, with a slow, swung drum pattern carrying the track along, and an almost sonar-like bleep which adds to the submarine atmosphere. Again, however, Dillon does not allow such murkiness to become mess, and within the timbral strangeness and detuned melodic fragments there is finely-tuned rhythmic control. As with the rest of the EP, moments of caprice which make Dillon’s music so intriguingly progressive are tempered by an exercise of control which is not an exertion of force, but the mark of a discerning restraint which leaves no room for self-indulgence.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/218032564&amp;color=999999&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Grischa Lichtenberger has always seemed an intriguing character. In terms of releases, he has done comparatively little since debuting on Raster Noton in 2009, yet he is still an artist who somewhat defines the label for me. Originally from Bielefeld (roughly equidistant between Dortmund and Hanover), Lichtenberger's approach to composition feels more about process than results, although he is not an artist who seems exclusively concerned with the chin-stroking electronic avante-garde. Listening to his mixes for example show how far his tastes stretch - one moment you are listening to solemn classical piano movements, the next a ballad from JJ Cale, before sounds which make you feel as if you've been plugged straight into a phone line. As odd as this mix sounds however - surprisingly it works, and it works incredibly well.</p>\n<p>His latest project, <em>La Demeure; il y a péril en la demeure</em> follows three years on from his last solo work, entering a frenetic maze of energies and textures, putting you in a constant state of disorientation. '134p78' crawls drunkenly whilst tracks like 'sf rect' dart this way and that at formidable speeds. The effect is like listening to Autechre at their most deluded - even the code-string track titles make the album difficult to make sense of. Despite it's rather antisocial nature, there is something conversely mesmeric and inviting about the LP - like a disturbing image you find it difficult to look away from.</p>\n<p>Take 'degrid skt' - the track is a mess of twitching paranoia and amphetamine charged glitches, but despite its rushing nature contains something something almost funk-like in its loose-fitting rhythms. '713 2' verges on similar themes, a malfunctioning whirlpool of fuse-blown loops and haywire rhythms manage to stay just within the confines of legibility, if you are able to dedicate your undivided attention to it.</p>\n<p>Caving in on itself, 'arct 1' brings the LP back to ground. Ghostly piano tones plume out in the backdrop as Lichtenberger's wire-mesh drum work shuffles brokenly in the track's closing third. The track makes a good example of how organic and synthetic timbres are put in contrast here - something which for me typifies Lichtenberger's work. 'keys t' is further case in point; field recordings and found sounds clearly make up a large proportion of the source material, however they are so heavily processed it's difficult to guess as to their exact origin. The effect is like viewing the world through some sort of matrix code - everything is warped by Lichtenberger's filter.</p>\n<p>'La Demeure', the first part of the album's title translates as: &quot;the joy of being withdrawn from economic, temporal or social restraints in the confinement of a home&quot; whilst the second part 'il y a péril en la demeure' is a legal term which enables the police to break into peoples' homes in the case of an 'imminent danger'. The suspension between these two concepts is something defining of the LP's sound, and expressed clearly, albeit in an abstract form.  But then perhaps this is to be expected - as idiosyncratic as his work is, when Lichtenberger does release something, he makes sure he has considered every detail.</p>\n<p>You can order the LP from the Raster Noton website, <a href=\"http://www.raster-noton.net/detail/index/sArticle/737/sCategory/9\">here</a>.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/224490177&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p>Having graduated from Manchester School of Sound Recording last year, Emanuele Porcinai's most recent project, WSR, was inaugurated in rather fine style at Berlin Atonal a couple of months back. His productions concern themselves with &quot;the contrast between acoustic music and synthetic rhythms&quot; - something more than audible in his debut WSR EP, 'Stainless'. There is more to this than that though - Porcinai is also interested in the effect space and architecture has on sound - 'Stainless' also experimenting heavily with different reverbs and spacial effects.</p>\n<p>He has not cut any corners in doing this either - the faded electro-acoustic experiments compiled here feature source materials recorded as far afield as Florence Italy, with the help of several other musicians; Thomas Griffiths performing on the cello &amp; double bass, as well as Niccolò Noli playing the electric bass. Porcinai himself also contributed piano, vocal and guitar recordings to the mix, and it is this interaction between these organic textures and his synthetic manipulations that makes this EP so striking.</p>\n<p>Take 'Debris' for example, cutting itching granular percussion against dust-covered piano refrains and thickly soaked swells of ambience. Melancholic, lo-fi guitar work in the Leyland Kirby/Jacaszek vein open the track, quickly migrating to something more electronic leaning as the percussive elements begin to wrestle control. 'No Horizon' inverts this slightly, beginning with echoing mine-shaft percussion, before buzzing low-end strings begin to interweave themselves, haunting and introspective.</p>\n<p>As well as his amalgamation of acoustic and electronic timbres, Porcinai has also managed to contrast tones which are beautifully fragile with those that are powerful and affront. Contrast the shuddering  demon-breath vocals of 'Stainless' for example, with the intimate cello play of 'Inner Ocean'.  There is something deeply intriguing about the way Porcinai has blended these textures, the use of natural reverbs acting as a stabilizer for the contrasting elements.</p>\n<p>As a debut release the 'Stainless' EP sets out a clear agenda for the WSR project, setting electroacoustic music in a context credible in both techno/industrial and more classical circles alike. We look forward to seeing his next movements.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/226422095&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Few artists working today can claim to have been as innovative as Éliane Radigue. Born in 1932, she became engaged in the vibrant Parisian avant-garde that was so eminent during the 50s, working under Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Henry, founders of musique concrète. As her sound developed, she specialised in the use of feedback and drones, moving gradually away from the chaotic stylings of Schaeffer and Henry. Almost all of her work in creating these drones has been written for a piece of analogue obscurity; the ARP 2500 synthesiser, a huge piece of hardware that is capable of bellowing rumbles of enormous depth.</p>\n<p>In the 1970s, she shared a studio with Laurie Spiegel at New York University to expand her sound. Her focus on reductionism began to align her more closely to the minimalist tradition that was encircling NYC at the time. After 1975 she began to incorporate the practice of meditation and Tibetan Buddhism into her work, which are now completely inseparable from her music. For a few years, she put her music on hold, choosing instead to retreat and study Buddhism. After returning from her studies, she continued to write several masterworks infused by her newly found Buddhist influence, including <em>Trilogie de la Mort</em>, a rumination on death, life and rebirth in the Tibetan tradition.</p>\n<p>Sonically, her work is startlingly bare. Often reduced to just one or two notes, there is a pivotal shift in how one is expected to listen to her music. Harmonic and rhythmic features are simply auxiliary, the focus instead on textural subtleties, and the overarching structure that can often last up to three hours. Since 2000, Radigue has focused on writing for acoustic instruments, and playing in groups. One of which is The Lappetites, an improvisational group held with Antye Greie-Ripatti — also known as AGF. Following a discussion of Radigue’s work with AGF, we spoke about the idea of arranging a conversation with Radigue. “She doesn’t use computers” she explained, “so write a letter first to explain your intentions.” Within a week we received a hand-written reply:</p>\n<p><em>“Dear George,</em></p>\n<p><em>Thank you very much for your kind letter. A lot of interesting questions – but too much to answer by mail. I don’t know if you have sometime an opportunity to come in Paris, in which case I’ll be happy to meet you and talk about it. You can call me about it: xxxxxxxxxxx. Never in the morning – if you hear the answering machine, leave a message – unless I’ll never call back numbers. I don’t know – see you one day – maybe.\nWith my very best,</em></p>\n<p><em>Éliane Radigue&quot;</em></p>\n<p>Two months later, we were in Radigue’s apartment in central Paris, as she pours us glasses of lemonade. “So”, she says, “what do you want to know?”...</p>\n<p><strong>We wanted to learn more about how you feel about your music and life at this point in time. How have you seen your attitudes towards music change, and how has culture responded to it since you first started writing?</strong></p>\n<p>There is much too much to answer about that in one go. And for all of these questions, there are so many directions I could go in that I have never explored. A lot of the questions you asked in your letter about society are not really my concern, or if they are, they are secondary to my main investment: music. One of the genuine answers about what you ask is that music is the only language which allows things that you cannot say with words or with anything else. So I will insist that we talk about music in the sense of something spiritual or ‘unponderable’ - something that has no materiality, something which is a kind of feeling, knowing or searching, a kind of spirituality that has no basis in reason. We are now in the part of Europe where rationality is much more explored than spirituality but the spiritual aspect of ourselves is there, whether through art or in front of the stars at night. It seems to me that only music somehow — or perhaps religion, but again this is too rational — is the only art in which the fullness of the three dimensions of time (past, present, future) are immediately there. Silence is part of music, and part of time; as soon as you hear something in music, it was already there in some sense before, and leads to where it is after. This brings a kind of fullness of consciousness because at that moment we are not anymore in any relative aspect of duration - duration becomes secondary. It is secondary even if we pay no attention it, there are some times where we are waiting for very long [looks around impatiently] &quot;one minute past and I’m already bored...&quot; So I’m not interested in the political or historical aspect of my music. Of course, it is included there by nature. Even if I just wave to you now; ‘hello!’ the act itself is already political; to welcome you. But this is something that we are just so acquainted with all the time anyway, and I never ask myself questions about it. Music for me is a way to think things that I cannot say - so maybe I have said everything, unless you have another question? [laughs]</p>\n<p><strong>It’s interesting that you mention time, is it true that you sometimes work on a piece of music for two or three years?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes because sometimes it is necessary for pieces that last 70-80 minutes. I was often working alone except for my cat, who is a very nice assistant (he gives me a look so that I know when to stop) [laughs]. I always work for such a long time on pieces with several sections and afterwards I have to go through the long mixing process et cetera. This is why I record things to tape because it was impossible to do in a live session. The first step was the concept of the piece, which is always the most important for me. I couldn’t write a song if I did not already have something in mind. So for a piece like <em>Adnos I-III</em>, when I had something already of the track, I just put that aside for maybe three months and came back to them and made a selection with a different way of listening for each. Only after about one year, did I have the constitution of the way I would articulate all these songs together. This is why it can take so long.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about your move from working individually to groups, for example with the The Lappetites?</strong></p>\n<p>That was brand new for me, working with other people. I didn’t give a precise direction when we were working together, I just gave what I will call the spirit of the piece. In <em>Elemental II</em> I insisted on going very far with the theme of universal humanity. This notion of the elements, of the solidity that sets our skeleton, the fluidity of water that brings life and that is in our blood and the air in the wind and heat… and we just spoke about that, and so we decided it was easier if each of them would be one of these elements. What interests me in working with these wonderful musicians is this connection, the freedom to bring your own feeling. The last time AGF came I suggested we work with our voice but without electronics, but that was not her thing. So I said ‘OK next time come with your microphone’. I was very sorry because she came from so far, I hope that she is not discouraged and does come back with her microphone!</p>\n<p><strong>You’ve also recently moved from electronic sounds to more instrumental, or acoustic sounds. Do you see this as a kind of return to your early influences?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes it has been like a spiral because classical music is my background and I am still fond of it. Classical music has so many different moods and feelings, it’s a complete world. I spent a while working with twelve tones in music in the same way that I think about a crossword or a sudoku. I was just interested in writing it and inspecting some of the rules, but I was not so interested in doing a kind of analysis. That was until I discovered musique concrète and Pierre Schaffer in France. It was so obvious that music is first of all a matter of <em>listening</em>. Pauline Oliveros made a basic statement about this: ‘deep listening’. This is right but Pierre Schaffer was already doing so without knowing it. It’s natural that if you listen in a deep way to something, that you will be totally 'caught' by it. In fact at the time I was living in Nice and there was a very small airport, and at the time I was very interested in the sounds of the different flights, and there was a lot of secondary and side effects, and we have this ability to filter different aspects, to make our own music through any kind of sounds. The <em>way</em> we listen gives us the meaning.</p>\n<p><strong>Did you ever consider your work in drone to be in some sense reactionary to the musique concrète that you first worked with?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh no, it was not a reaction because the first time I listened to concrète music, it was already with natural sounds and centred on some kind of vibration; running water, wind et cetera. It’s the vibration of some material, and what interests me about so-called ‘drone’ is just like a means amongst others to project the tones, harmonics, subharmonics and contents of the sounds. That was what interested me the most; trying to dig into the sound, like you do when plunging into water, just to be immersed in the sound, and trying to work into it. The first piece I did on tape was <em>Elemental I</em> and at that point I was at a kind of changing point. Not a changing point in my music, but in my way of plugging or digging into the sound. In the 70s I put music secondary through my studying of Tibetan Buddhism and I thought that I would not make music anymore, but that’s impossible [laughs]. When I came back, I made a piece which was also inspired by the elements. For me it would be that basic ground to build from. So now I realise the rolling of the earth also contains somehow the kind of projection of other elements. For example, when you hear in the mountain you hear bells, and when the bells stop, you have all the mountains which is full of harmonics and this comes from contact with the earth. Wind and water are also very very rich materials and the sound is floating, floating through basic natural elements. It’s not a mean, it’s an end in itself. I don’t have any precept, it’s like doing an arpeggio or scale, these are just basic material, like words. They are words, but words made of another kind of sound. I don’t have any big statement about anything like that I don’t think.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you see your music as a form of meditation in itself?</strong></p>\n<p>There are several meditations. There is no one meditation. Meditation is like music, I’m not actually acquainted with the new music of young people like techno and all that, but it's music! Meditation is the same, there are several aspects and of course there is obviously a link, music is a kind of meditation whether we know it or not. To say that I make music as meditation or to meditate ‘as music’ is there just by nature somehow. In fact, just to go a step forward, in tradition, in a spiritual sense, all religions include music in their rituals. Whichever spiritual tradition you look at, the ritual — like playing an instrument in a complex way — is just there as a kind of building this connection. It’s like switching on a TV, the simple pushing of a button leads to so much complexity, and you can catch a little aspect of the spiritual nature through rituals. Meditation can be like that [snaps fingers] or it can be much more complex. Music is everywhere and in every sound, everything in life is meditation, it depends on the way we are listening. Meditation depends on our way of being aware of what is in our minds. Whatsoever it is. After that, the rest is just technics, like keeping ones body in a good condition and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you still have the ARP?</strong></p>\n<p>Not me, but my producer in Paris does. I couldn’t have him — I call the ARP him, not it [laughs] — when I start to work with musicians, it was a kind of divorce. I could always go and visit him, but I won’t play. But it’s still somehow still mine. I have played with digital synthesisers, and yes they are very good instruments, I learnt about them at college and found it very interesting. In the 90s, I was invited via a sponsorship to use these intriguing instruments, the first month i spent with that was great. Wowee the marvellous sounds that came from all that! Eventually I was like 'oh well, wonderful sounds is maybe not really my way...' and so I gave that up, or to be more precise, I thought that I would have to spend years working with it et cetera.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you first discover the instrument?</strong></p>\n<p>I was in the United States in 1970 and I had been invited to a conference at NYU and this is where I learned to play with it. The only thing that was difficult for me was working directly with the electronics. All the connections were made by wire, it was just working in a plate of spaghetti. If you made a bad move you could just take something off. You have to check everything, and it was very complicated. So in a way I was working very slowly and carefully. I was also working very slowly and carefully with the feedback, keeping the right distance with the microphone and the loudspeaker, to catch the sounds. It was the same working with the tape recorder; you have to be very careful not to break something. I never used a keyboard with the ARP, and people never understood that. It was the same price but I didn’t want it, I didn’t want to be tempted by it, and that was it. It’s been about 30 years, a long marriage!</p>\n<iframe width=\"550\" height=\"413\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1RrsiGmLp_E\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><em>Special thanks to Elsa Hewitt for translation.</em></p>\n",

    "content": "<p>In 2012 Mika Vainio &amp; Franck Vigroux performed live at Le Générateur in Paris. This event was supposedly the starting point for their debut release together, <em>Peau Froide, Léger Soleil</em>, which emerged on Repitch's noisey sister-label Cosmo Rhythmic earlier this month. It's difficult not to be intrigued by this LP even prior to listening. If the idea of Sähko founder Mika Vainio and French experimentalist Franck Vigroux working together weren't enough, the album's cover features three deers lounging next to a drinks machine by a shop window. Have Coca-Cola jumped on the bandwagon sponsoring reclusive nob-twiddlers or is there something more considered at work here? Aside from anything else, the artwork suggests an unsettling balance between the natural and the synthetic, something which typifies both their work.</p>\n<p>One  of the other defining ideas explored in the LP is the contrast in  volume and temper. Many of the tracks here begin with rather timid soundscapes before the  tranquility is broken by deafening waves of distortion which can hit at any  point with  little warning, keeping the listener in a constant state of tension. Opener 'Deux' defines this from the outset - gloomy phone-line ambience suddenly giving way to a power-drill assault of noise-caked  beats. Then, just as quickly as the duo's explosion of noise begins it cuts back to the brooding, ice-palace soundscapes of 'Memoire' - haunting chimes, glacial swells and plodding static crawling brokenly.</p>\n<p>'Souffles' maintains an equally remote, arctic feel, feeling as if you were staring up to a glowing sun from the bottom of a crevasse. A break from isolation  comes in the tracks closing moments, inaudible alien voices entering the  mix inquiringly alongside crystalline drones. These Warbling vocoders  make repeat appearances throughout the LP, in manipulations similar to  those found in Franck Vigroux's 2010 album, <em>Camera Police</em>.</p>\n<p>There is also a  highly cinematic quality to the LP; it's the sort of soundtrack you might expect if Gaspar Noe had directed the first Matrix film. Take the radioactive-electro reductions of 'Mutant', or the tremoring mix of grating synths and ultra-simple, Joy Division reminiscent drum patterns through 'Parabole' - there is something incredibly visual about Vainio &amp; Vigroux's soundscapes. Characteristically morbid, 'Le Souterrain' is another case in  point - creeping bleeps and blips are dulled as if heard underground - clearing to reveal pensive blues guitar embellishments in the track's closing section.</p>\n<p>Vainio &amp; Vigroux are somewhat masters of snarling, devilish noise excursions, however it is the use of these aforementioned cinematic textures that make these moments all the more gratifying when they do come. Take 'Ravages' for example,  its half-step, off-kilter rhythms are permeated by plummeting circular-saw bass drones. These occupy the headspace so fully, Vainio &amp; Vigroux's cuts to Autechre style glitch percussion are all the more effective. The LP's closer 'Le crane tambour' in part at least, also makes a typical example of the overbearing static percussion well-worn by Pan Sonic, however there is also an unexpected degree of funk to the track - pointed synth melodies making an interesting juxtaposition against the pair's frostbitten rhythmic reductions.</p>\n<p>Listening back to the Le Générateur performance after an initial listen of the LP, it is already clear that the pair have come some way in perfecting this combination in their work together. Needless to say, bringing  two artists so well established together is a rather impressive footing for Cosmo Rhythmatic, setting them up for some interesting further movements.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>If you mentioned the name Killawatt to me a year or so back, the first thing that would have popped into my head would be brooding, precisely engineered 140bpm half-step. Over the last couple of years however, Watt's productions have taken a shift in direction. The growling, depth charge subs, and ultra-crisp production skills are still there, however Matt Watt, the artist behind the project has begun to explore slower tempos in the form of gnarled off-kilter techno.</p>\n<p>Alongside a slew of 12&quot;s in this newfound vein (notably including a wickedly twisted EP for Tom Diccico's immaculate Run Out Run series), earlier this year saw the release of Watt's debut LP, <em>émigré</em>. Comprising a mix of gristled warehouse stompers and deranged, circuit-bent dub, the distinctive  energy and crushing bass-weight that defined early Killawatt releases feels as present as ever.</p>\n<p>With a selection of remixes of LP cuts due out shortly, we decided to catch up with Watts to find out about some of his most memorable gigging experiences, as part of our That Time When series.</p>\n<p>#1 London_2007</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5769/22366519455_589edb6a3d_b.jpg\" alt=\"ldn\"></p>\n<p>Pink Floyd have, and probably will always be the greatest band ever for me so to be able to see Roger Waters &amp; Nick Mason perform ‘Dark Side of the Moon’ live at Earls Court was truly mind blowing. It’s hard to express in words how epic the performance, production and sound was in all honesty, but you know it must be impressive when you’re surrounded by middle aged men sobbing through the vocal solo in ‘Great Gig in the Sky’, and Gilmour’s spine tingling guitar solo in ‘Comfortably Numb’.</p>\n<p>#2 Pula_2013</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/756/22178819720_3042610779_b.jpg\" alt=\"pula\"></p>\n<p>The Osiris Boat Party at Outlook in 2013 is easily the most fun I’ve had at a festival. All the sets I played that weekend were awesome but playing back to back with Icicle on the Osiris Music UK boat party was hilarious and so much hype. Jeroen was somebody I had always looked up to as a producer so to organise a last minute b2b was a big deal for me at the time. The set started pretty deep, gradually quickening and intensifying into all out OTT techy, jump up shenanigans by the end. Outlook has always been a festival where the DJ’s tend to let go and get a bit silly and this boat party definitely confirmed that. I have to give a shout to the MC Toast too, for being on point and whipping the boat up into a frenzy.</p>\n<p>#3 London_2014</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/721/22178908970_84dc49470d_b.jpg\" alt=\"ldn2\"></p>\n<p>Booking Shackleton, Laurel Halo and Demdike Stare was very impressive scheduling from St Johns Sessions. Shackleton is one of my top three producers and DJs, and this was the first time I had managed to check out his live set. The place was packed and I was stood right at the very back, tucked next to a pillar carrying one of the many speakers dotted around. Not being able to see much I just ended up head down, zoning out hard to the music. The sheer simplicity, rhythmic energy, rawness and power of Shackleton’s sound definitely left a lasting impression on me - it was pure brilliance!</p>\n<p>#4 Berlin_2015</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5772/22179230888_0421206599_b.jpg\" alt=\"berlin\"></p>\n<p>Due to an unfortunate health and safety incident at Stattbad a few weeks earlier, this Stattnacht gig was been moved to a small complex of derelict warehouses elsewhere in Berlin but it turned out to be an absolute corker. On what must have been one of the hottest days of the year, the smaller, but not insignificant room two was absolutely packed (and seriously sweaty) by the time I’d finished playing the first two hours. Dadub were up next with a super dark, tribal live set, and then Paula Temple finished off the night with a barnstormer.</p>\n<p>I got way too drunk and ended up spending the whole night rambling around on my own having an absolute whale of a time chatting shit to countless Germans and having it to Paula Temple’s set of fast paced, euphoric techno. Eventually I woke up at 9am on a sofa in the bar, got lost walking back to my hotel and chilled in a park with a few stragglers before eventually making it to bed. All in all it was a pretty fun night.</p>\n<p>#5 Berlin_2014</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5820/22353909052_c5d8d92a26_b.jpg\" alt=\"berlin2\"></p>\n<p>It was really cool to be involved in the first night of Tommy Four Seven’s new ‘47’ event, 47.1 at the Arena Club in Berlin. Tommy was super excited about it all and that seemed to flow through everybody there that night. It was one of the sets that just went absolutely perfectly. The energy was right, the crowd was amazing and I was fully in the zone. Unfortunately the 8am flight back was not so great…</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/227363765&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p>After the initial few days of prickling sound design, celestial ambience and crumbling bass drones at this year's Berlin Atonal, Blood Music's set provided a forceful jolt back to reality. Thundering, broken-beat rhythms, palpitation inducing shockwaves of low-end and gurgling electronic distortions made a welcome break from the comparatively tranquil selection of drone and ambient that had gone before.</p>\n<p>In its live form, the project has seen numerous incarnations over the years. These days however, the project is run exclusively by its founder Simon Pomery, who has always been the sole author of Blood Music's recorded works. Given this, the Blood Music sound is perhaps not as straight forward as you might expect. The debut Blood Music EP for example sits somewhere between roughed up post-punk and avante-garde electronics. These days however Blood Music material seems more concerned with exploring the limits of dancefloor friendly music - given this, perhaps it's little wonder Pomery has found a fitting home on Powell's Diagonal imprint.</p>\n<p>Back in London several weeks after Atonal, I met with Pomery in a dusky E8 boozer to discuss the show, Taiko drumming and his long-awaited Blood Music debut LP.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/210731802&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>So how did you find the set at Atonal? It looked like quite an endurance test... Were you improvising the rhythms?</strong></p>\n<p>Atonal was certainly an endurance test, for all involved. I played an extremely demanding set: it’s not just electronic improvisation, it’s the physical demands of the drum playing, and these two things in tandem. Most of the drum parts are locked down, so that becomes muscle memory, although there is some room for improvisation and variation on what I’ve written. I played mostly new tracks, and also 'Badgering' which is on the recent 12&quot;. There's always an improvised element because I'm using a noise box, synths and a drum-machine. The first 15 minutes was a new piece called ‘Contact Drumming’: an acid improvisation, voice composition, and prepared guitar through filters, to which I’m programming kick drum phases. When I play live drums I'm echoing those kick drums and phase patterns. ‘Contact Drumming’ is a reference to Steve Reich - lines of drum phases building and building so that you can hear (and see) the structure of the music. I’m using contact mics for voice and for the tone of the drum.</p>\n<p><strong>The Diagonal showcase was really refreshing at Atonal as it brought a lot of energy and some humour to the festival...</strong></p>\n<p>I felt proud of what we did too because I felt like we were representing London. Towards the end, I was playing voice files from two friends of mine, Lilith Whittles and Sophie Colletta, who are saying “I love you” to each other. I started blowing kisses at the audience: not your usual Atonal action I don’t think. What a lot of people said to me after I played is how refreshing it was to see such a physical performance, and how the physicality effected their own bodies. I use electronics, but I use acoustic instruments. With everyone everywhere pressing buttons it can get boring, depending on the act, I guess. I have broken something at every Blood Music gig there’s ever been: I play hard until something gives way, which in this case was the Atonal snare drum.</p>\n<p>I thought the main power station was beautiful but preferred it downstairs where we were: hot and heavy. I started the show hitting the snare drum alone, and we were measuring the reverb - tonally very beautiful, and more and more people were descending the massive staircase, flooding in, following the sound, ready to go fucking mental. When it was absorbed by 700 people there was a great balance between tone, volume, and reverb. It was great to have Florence To on live motion graphics. She put my sounds through her visuals programme to show rhythmic pulses over three screens.</p>\n<p><strong>And did you lob your drumstick at someone at some point?</strong></p>\n<p>(Laughs) Yeah. I did aim it at him but I did it nicely. At the start this lad said to me &quot;I hate everything I've seen and heard at this festival, can you do something fun, please?” 15 minutes into my set I was playing 'Sharking' with contact mics - a one minute drone, so I can meditate a bit, and have a physical breather after all the relentless waves of ‘Contact Drumming’, and he starts heckling and saying &quot;what are you doing, this is shit, do something else&quot; and I went &quot;oh really&quot;, and I'd just broken a drum stick, which I threw at him. I didn't do it very hard and I didn't aim at his face - it hit him in the chest, but in the moment I just thought &quot;we don't need this&quot;. He was stunned and stopped speaking. I started playing 'Badgering’, and his face lit up. His hands went in the air and stayed there until the end of the set. I think he knew I wasn't being mean without reason. I was just letting him know I think you should be quiet now because it's badgering time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://s86.photobucket.com/user/georgemc25/media/22093719479_b823fd9b85_z_zpsei4mzk5n.jpg.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k114/georgemc25/22093719479_b823fd9b85_z_zpsei4mzk5n.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\" photo 22093719479_b823fd9b85_z_zpsei4mzk5n.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>I also wanted to ask you about the Taiko drumming you have mentioned as an influence on your latest EP for Diagonal.</strong></p>\n<p>Taiko, like all percussion, is a huge thing in Blood Music, but one influence among many, and I stress the word influence: I’m not appropriating Taiko, I’m influenced by it. The sticks I use are an orchestral mallet/stick hybrid, and the influence in this context is more like a network of inspirations. I used to play in a bunch of bands just for the experience, but I began to resent the idea of the percussionist being at the back. I resented that there's this sort of unspoken and repressive hierarchy in bands - it didn't make any sense to me. So I developed this way of standing up and playing.</p>\n<p>I've also done some martial arts over the years. I'm doing Thai kickboxing at the moment, and something called Eskrima which is a form of stick fighting from Singapore. When I started this I thought brilliant - as a drummer it’s great for your shoulders. When I was developing my new style of drumming I was thinking about how you use Eskrima - right foot forward, left foot back, left heel up: southpaw. When you're hitting this way there is so much power because you're using your whole body. It's a different language for transmitting what you feel emotionally and intellectually into rhythms on a drum-head. It's another way of communicating. I love interplay between voice and drum: a melodic approach to percussion, a percussive approach to voice.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/124303769&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Can you tell me a little bit about the evolution of Blood Music? Kenichi Iwasa &amp; Adam Kerle used to be part of the group right - did it start as a three piece?</strong></p>\n<p>No, Blood Music has always been me, although a few people have come and gone for live shows. I was living in Newington Green subletting a flat which turned out to be on the same street where my dad lived when he was born. So I was really attached to this place. I made a track with a drum and prepared guitar and called it 'Blood Music' - that's where it came from: pulse, phasing, tone, drums. So I was recording by myself, but interested in collaboration and ensemble playing. I used to say to the others “play like a machine”. I made the “Blood Music E.P.” like this, writing and rehearsing all the parts, then playing long takes one after another in the studio. I played those tracks, ‘Rare Earth Material’ and ‘Speak Like Violence’ live with the others, but it didn’t work playing it with them in the studio, so I did everything myself: drum kit, drum machines, guitar, Pro One and Analogue Systems, found percussion. However, that sound evolved slowly. With Tobin Jones I designed a special ambient mic setup to record instruments in his skatebowl in Wembley: it’s a huge warehouse, with the studio sealed off in the same building, and it’s been an essential part of the BM sound.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/604/22280551575_6ceeed21d9_b.jpg\" alt=\"skate\"></p>\n<p><strong>When I first met Kenichi I was talking to him about music and I remember asking him to send me some stuff. I remember him saying he doesn't really record anything... I don't know if he was talking about Blood Music or another project.</strong></p>\n<p>No, Ken doesn't record anything, but after much effort on my part I have managed to get him into the studio from time to time. He has a totally different idea about what music is to me: he just does it in the moment, but through his approach to music and art generally he inspires a large network of people in London and beyond. He instantly got the Taiko thing. Adam got me a book on it for my birthday, then Ken said to me &quot;Simon, there's this Taiko ensemble called Kodo, and one Japanese translation of Kodo is Blood Music&quot;. Kodo also means ‘pre-language’ - your state of thought before a word comes to you. Like a child's innocence in their minds before they've been cultured.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Adam stopped and Jordan Cunningham played some shows. Every time we played, Jordan would use an entirely different setup. He nearly blew up the Room 1 Funktion One at Corsica. He had brought this Russian synth, we were soundchecking and the two sound guys ran out going &quot;stop! turn it off, turn it off!&quot; and he said, very politely, and very apologetically, “ah I'm really sorry, I didn't know it did that because that part of the synth never worked before...” As it was Soviet, he didn't have the parts for it. In any case, Jordan is one of the loudest people I have ever made noise with. Around this time we blew a few speakers. There’s a video of a PA on fire. A guy called Xix played some shows with me: guttural vocals which I sampled on ‘Chicks’.</p>\n<p>More recently I have wanted to play alone because I don't want to have to pay to rehearse with anyone. It’s more uncompromising to do it myself. In any case, no one has wanted to do it as much as me, or been as certain about what Blood Music is, so this is a natural development. It’s more honest since it’s always been one bloke.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/90967177&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>And you've been working on your album for two years now, how far off is it? Do you think that will be a new development in sound from the last tape and 12&quot;?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, it's a big development from the 12&quot;. In a time of austerity I called that tape 'Health, Wealth &amp; Happiness’. This is also why the 12&quot; has 'Chicks’, with a picture of a baby chick on it. The digital image is yellow. It's nauseatingly bright. Not black and white. Not melancholy. But livid. On my recent work there’s also a more expansive interest in female voice and sound poetry. There's more complex percussion and more modular processes, and I’m using Logic X. I could say more.</p>\n<p><strong>In your Quietus interview you mentioned Russell Haswell had a role on the LP - can you tell me a bit more about your working relationship with him</strong></p>\n<p>There was a Diagonal party in Islington Mill about a year ago - Oscar asked me to play drums to his DJ set. We had one PA each: one for Powell’s records, one for Blood Music drums. The most fun thing to play was ‘Temptation and Desire’ by Silent Servant. Before the show I found a piece of sheet metal in a skip, which I mic’d up. People said they couldn't believe how indistinguishable the two sounds were, the percussion stabs on the Silent Servant record, and my drums and sheet metal... There was this gorgeous symbiosis where everything came together - the DJ and the drumming and the sounds. Russell played after. We were upstairs and he said &quot;Simon, I really want to work with you&quot;.</p>\n<p>Russell's role has been giving general encouragement, and over two sessions engineering certain processes I wanted. I put my drum loops through Russell’s modular, then I played with filters. Then worked on them in Logic X, recorded two days of material with Tobin Jones at The Park Studios, and edited further. I’m so glad I’m taking this long.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"5\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/6opIEHChKV/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">BLOOD MUSIC LIVE</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A video posted by Chang Park (@chang_park) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2015-08-21T06:16:52+00:00\">Aug 20, 2015 at 11:16pm PDT</time></p></div></blockquote>\n<script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script>\n<p><strong>So you know Russell through Diagonal?</strong></p>\n<p>I met Russell at the very first Diagonal night, in summer 2013, which was at The Waiting Room. It was Blood Music, Russ, Jaime, Oscar, and Joe from Raime. Russ came in giving me devil horn fingers as I was soundchecking. When I first heard his computer music, in 2001, I thought he was a straight-faced academic. He isn’t.</p>\n<p><strong>I had also read a little bit about your poetry work - to what extent does this inform how you work as a musician?</strong></p>\n<p>I feel similarly about writing to how I do about music in that I feel I have to make the sounds I hear in my head. I have a language addiction and a music addiction. Music can be anti-language, pre-language, an escape from language: this frees you from it. One challenge is: how far can you push language in a club track, to try and combine something that's poetically interesting with something that's sonically interesting? Bruce Gilbert's approach to words is inspiring in ‘The Shivering Man’, as is Keiji Haino: you know, he'll be screaming &quot;do not name me do not name me for if you name me I will not be everywhere&quot;. The ‘Text-Sound Compositions’ compilation was a revelation for me and has influenced my approach to voice. Someone special introduced it to me.</p>\n<p>With music one thing that's so freeing about it is that you could have a track with just one word and it could mean the world. There’s a renewed interest in concrete poetry after Primary Information reprinted the Emmett Williams anthology - which is truly international, poets from absolutely everywhere. ‘The New Concrete’ has just come out. But you can actually use some of this stuff as scores - language that you are going to use in a track. But then using one syllable, one sound or one refrain is in techno and acid, and in extended vocal technique also. It's all over the place.</p>\n<p>In terms of making tracks you can break it down into units of speech. If you take the morpheme, which is the smallest unit of speech that has meaning, like ‘in-‘ or ‘sub’-, then take the phoneme which doesn't mean anything, ‘/k’/ or ‘/ts/‘, you can make tracks that have absolutely no meaning, but because of the physicality and the emotion with which people have performed them - these sounds that don't mean anything taken out of context suddenly have emotional power. In this way, sound poetry, concrete poetry, and a minimal use of words and vocal sounds in music, have much in common. This is infinitely fascinating.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/214648550&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Since Drum &amp; Bass began, the genre seems to have adopted a peculiar exercise in self-reflexivity. References litter throughout to the ‘golden era’; rehashing old trademarks for that ‘classic’ sound. The desire to source hallmarks of the genre seems to have replaced the desire to create something new. Thus, it can sometimes feel as though producers are playing a game of spot-the-reference, making D&amp;B something of a self-enclosed system. The kind that Punk could only have dreamed of. This notion has been formalised by Simon Reynolds as the ‘Hardcore Continuum’; the idea that innovation in dance music stems from the deviation of a stylistic norm: hardcore. This is no bad thing. Speaking with Trouw Amsterdam, Terre Thaemlitz aka DJ Sprinkles denounced this motivation for original creation:</p>\n<p><em>“If I concede that my own subjective tastes – even seemingly perverse or deviant ones – emerge from my exposure to culture, then originality is no longer a possibility. Originality is only a representational fiction…”</em></p>\n<p>Just the sheer number of D&amp;B classics that there are to reference has given it mythical status. Satirical music publication Wunderground recently posted an <a href=\"http://wundergroundmusic.com/dj-playing-91-93-classic-jungle-set-since-november-admits-he-may-run-out-of-classics-soon/\">article</a> with the heading; “<em>DJ playing 91-93 classic jungle set since November admits he may run out classics “soon”</em>...” But some producers deviate from the stylistic norm so drastically as to warrant a unique space of their own. One such innovator is Dyl, who for his latest EP, <em>Concept</em>, has incorporated industrial influences into the sound.</p>\n<p>There are points on <em>Concept</em> where sounds come through clear and distinct. Flourishes appear and recess into nothingness before your eyes. ’Concept 1’, for example, opens the EP with a distant croon that sounds like the whimper of a dying elephant. ’Rational’, by contrast, is an experiment in horizontal abstraction that wouldn’t sound out of place on a Yaporigami record. On ‘x05510,’ a disconnected racket spills across the stereo field. With so much sonic material available, it can sometimes feel like wading through thick molasses. But Dyl commands the textures like a magician builds tension. He holds suspense until a slight of hand reveals something remarkable.</p>\n<p>What makes this EP most striking is that every arbitrary flicker of noise or rumble of bass has every nuance of detail attended to. From the hyperfiltered frequencies to the fleeting glitches that twitch like an electric shock. No avenue unexplored, no leaf unturned. The result is an EP with more labour put into it than most put into an entire album. The historical lineage is not forgotten, but the progression still persists.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/226503758&color=666666&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

The fact that Portals Editions' most recent signees take the same name for their project seems odd in this case, as noise and distortion lace every fibre of their works.</p>\n<p>The debut release from the Berlin label came from Shaddah Tuum, pursuing a challenging mix between techno and doom metal. Gainstage’s self-titled LP pushes the combination of these two genres to breaking point. However, unlikely pairings are a concept not unfamiliar to Gainstage members Arik Hayut and Pierce Warnecke. Describing their first meeting, Hayut reveals the two certainly didn’t come across each other by intention. “Strange circumstances is an understatement” he begins. &quot;I had something like a date with a woman called Maya. She asked me to join her for dinner with a group of French friends of a friend whom she’d never met before. At a Persian restaurant in Berlin Kreuzberg, Pierce and I ended up sitting in front of one another and started an inevitable conversation. At the time I was in search of a competent mixer for my dark-pop project Aritape, and through our conversation it became clear that we share some fundamental views concerning music making. The next time we met was in my studio, and we ended up producing the Aritape project together, among other things.  I never met Maya again.&quot;</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/103342828?color=ffffff&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"580\" height=\"327\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>Having worked on Gainstage material together for the past three years or so, the project has reached has reached a level of sonic complexity which is really rather impressive given the fact that it has significant foundations in live instrumentation. “Essentially Arik plays either live drums with triggers or MIDI drums” Warnecke explains. &quot;Those trigger heavily processed samples, which are also sent to me to trigger more abstract sounds. I build the drones, bring in electronic sounds, process the global mix. Together we try and build up hypnotic parts - there's definitely a Swans-influence in terms of long buildups.&quot;</p>\n<p>Although under the Gainstage moniker their releases have been relatively sparse, both have had significant production experience as individuals outside of the project. &quot;I come from a background of music synthesis&quot; Warnecker continues. &quot;I work a lot with sound design and synthesis - making weird blips you could say. We have both worked a lot in noisier/improvised music scenes, from which I think we draw a lot of inspiration - maybe not specifically sonically but in terms of energy, freedom, risk. I was definitely drawn into the ‘crispier’ side of noise through improv and noise scenes in France and Germany, but also really appreciate people who integrated that sound in a more produced way - take Tim Hecker or Ben Frost’s early works.&quot;</p>\n<p>Hayut on the other hand, has always been focussed on the more rhythmic side of electronic music (as evidenced by the shuddering, 'City cum Temple' featured in the mix below). &quot;For me, drums-playing has to have an elevating aspect, reaching the deepest unconscious feeling of oneness and my goal is to try and reach those moments on stage&quot; he divulges. &quot;In the studio these days, I concentrate on my current solo project Arikon, which is based on distorted beats compositions. My previous project, Aritape, is more of an idiosyncratic persona I adopted, through which I generate dark pop songs. On stage I’d like to see myself as a city-cum-temple priest, whereas in the studio I function as a pattern producer and frequency-tamer.&quot;</p>\n<p>Following the vinyl release of their LP, backed by remixes from Orphan Swords &amp; Cut Hands, Gainstage's mix for us covers a range of the warped, static heavy techno the duo have become best known for - an exercise in restraint and full-throttle noise in equal measure.</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist</strong></p>\n<p>Arikon – City Cum Temple [Unreleased] <br>\nShaddahtuum – Merkaba  (Dadub Remix) [Portals Editions] <br>\nAlec Empire – Low On Ice [Mille Plateaux] <br>\nEric Holm – Stave [Subtext] <br>\nOrphan Swords – Hooker [Desire] <br>\nPan Sonic – Uranokemia [Blast First] <br>\nKetev – Zelah [Opal Tapes] <br>\nSamuel Kerridge – Heavy Metal [Downwards] <br>\nValerio Tricoli &amp; Thomas  Ankersmit – Hunt [PAN] <br>\nJohn Wiese – Sad Psychics [Troubleman Unlimited] <br>\nJohn Chowning – Stria [WERGO] <br>\nSwans - Half Life [K.422] <br></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"60\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?embed_type=widget_standard&embed_uuid=7be7d020-bf54-44e3-b741-4ee12b32c5fd&feed=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0052-gainstage%2F&hide_artwork=1&hide_cover=1&hide_tracklist=1&mini=1&replace=0\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><div style=\"clear: both; height: 3px; width: 632px;\"></div><p style=\"display: block; font-size: 11px; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px; padding: 3px 4px; color: rgb(153, 153, 153); width: 632px;\"><a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/0052-gainstage/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=base_links&utm_term=resource_link\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:#808080; font-weight:bold;\">0052 // Gainstage</a><span> by </span><a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=base_links&utm_term=profile_link\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:#808080; font-weight:bold;\">Stray Landings</a><span> on </span><a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=base_links&utm_term=homepage_link\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:#808080; font-weight:bold;\"> Mixcloud</a></p><div style=\"clear: both; height: 3px; width: 632px;\"></div>",

    "content": "<p>NTS and the ICA. No, not two new shady government surveillance organisations, but a Dalston-based online radio station, and promoter of 'radical art and culture' the Institute of Contemporary Arts. Amongst their diverse endeavours, both have invested plenty of effort in promoting the more sonically challenging ends of the electronic music spectrum, and in 2014 NTS was announced as one of the ICA’s 'Associate Artist Partners', a pairing that has seen the two collaborate on a programme of events at the institute.</p>\n<p>For this latest collaboration, the ICA ran an exhibition entitled <em>Enter The Dragon</em> across 13 days in October, inspired by the 1973 Bruce Lee film of the same name. The climax of the film sees Lee – spoiler alert – barehandedly tackle his clawed opponent in a disorientating hall of mirrors, and it is this setting that the ICA theatre took inspiration from as the space for a series of musical performances. Each of the hour-long sessions saw a pair of musicians responding to and playing off each other in largely improvised performances, communicating – or failing to – from either end of the room on facing stages. The stages were partially obscured by several ceiling high, rotating mirrored panels, hindering easy dialogue between the musicians and creating a bedazzling effect for the audience sandwiched in the middle.</p>\n<p>Conceived by Chinese artist Zhang Ding in association with NTS, the series saw all manner of styles grace the space, from the industrial-electro beat poems of Lord Tusk to the snarling punk rock indebted stylings of Wild Daughter. The series culminated with a crushing face-off between PAN founder Bill Kouligas, aka Family Battle Snake, and Gum Artefacts duo, Amnesia Scanner.</p>\n<p>Some of the previous shows had felt disjointed, as one might expect from an experimental venture that often set contradictory styles against each other; but the potential  for failure was what gave the series a unique point of interest. Although the musicians had been given some limited time to prepare in an open rehearsal earlier in the day, the performances were mostly spontaneous and so carried all the attending aleatoric risks. Moreover, this approach felt right at home at the ICA, which operates as a ‘live’ home of contemporary culture – a place where culture happens, rather than somewhere cultural artefacts are presented in their finished form.</p>\n<p>Amnesia Scanner and Bill Kouligas proved more conciliatory adversaries, providing a perfect mix of both contrasting and complimentary sounds. It was also pleasing to see (or rather hear) the two acts improvising successfully together – for example, Amnesia Scanner contributing broken shockwaves of low-end between Kouligas's stuttered ambience.</p>\n<p>What could have felt like something of a pastiche of in-vogue leftfield electronica – huge creaking glacial roars and sharp fragments of broken techno – was much enlivened by Kouligas &amp; Scanner crowbarring in a number of amusingly unexpected sounds. Roaring F1 samples, SEGA videogame commandments and digitalised psychedelia all made appearances between the frenetic post-rave soundscapes. Within the glittering and disorientating space,  the artists’ electronic expulsions refracted through each other and spliced together to create a sonic environment that vacillated between intricate detail and a satisfying crudeness.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"5\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/9TCi7zhuw0/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">Enter The Dragon @icalondon @bill_kouligas</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A video posted by Stray Landings (@straylandingsrecordings) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2015-10-26T10:29:53+00:00\">Oct 26, 2015 at 3:29am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote>\n<script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Nathan Thomas / Fluid Radio</em></p>\n<p>Café Oto’s most recent residency brought Korean cellist Okkyung Lee to the Dalston venue for four days of solo and collaborative performances. I caught day two of the residency, where Lee, a prolific collaborator, played with Sheffield based multidisciplinary artist, Mark Fell. The two are an interesting pairing, being sonically very different yet clearly taking similar, often improvisational approaches and drawing on comparable influences, be these ambient, noise, jazz or avant-garde.</p>\n<p>The evening begun with a solo performance from Okkyung Lee. Lee played in the middle of the candlelit room, inviting audience members to sit on the floor around her. This was an intensely physical performance, aided by the intimate, stage-less venue. Lee’s playing jumped around from being frenetic and time signature free, to sections that were more akin to a drum roll than traditional cello. The relentless twenty minute performance, in which her bow was blur almost throughout, continually defied my expectations of how cello can be played. Particularly impressive was just how percussive the instrument became under Lee’s control.</p>\n<p>The collaborative performance with Mark Fell, who sat across the room, facing Okkyung Lee, comprised of three pieces, broken up by a long interval after the first. In this first performance Fell emitted almost only drums, which were minimal in tone but fluid in timing, reminiscent of the drums on his collaborative album from this year with Gábor Lázár. Sonically, the two musicians produced almost opposed sounds; Fell’s clinical, clean drums contrasted the raw, predominantly unprocessed sound of Lee’s cello playing. Moreover, there was a conflict between the physicality of the two performers, Lee playing violently and expressively, and Fell sat still, occasionally padding at the touchpad of his laptop. This worked incredibly well, producing a tension and atmosphere I’d not previously experienced.</p>\n<p>The second collaborative piece was almost drumless, though, thanks to Okkyung Lee, still highly percussive. Mark Fell replaced drums in this piece with a synthesised drone, which slowly became more rhythmic over around 20 minutes. Lee overlaid this with screeching cello, making audible the rough texture of the coiled strings, and at times utilising the taut strings below the bridge. Fell’s sounds were less clinical this time around, and at times became distorted and twitching. As a result, there were moments of sonic unity in this piece, where the sounds of the two performers were hard to distinguish. This was a stark contrast to the conflicting sounds of the first collaborative piece. The final piece was the only one to have a distinct tempo. Original sounds from Fell were largely absent here, instead he subtly processed Lee’s playing with loops and delays. This was the least frenzied piece, both musicians playing with more restrained than in the preceding pieces.</p>\n<p>Given the sonic disparity of the two musicians, they delivered a surprisingly cohesive performance, at times tense and conflicted, yet at others, complementary and harmonious. Lee summed the evening up well, standing up at the end the performance, cheerfully announcing to the 50 or so audience members: “that was fun.”</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/90709059&color=8e8e8e&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Why is tape so fascinating? In the past decade, we have converted to smaller, higher definition and more pocket-friendly formats. Yet despite these advances, we still remain somewhat anchored to formats of the past. There is something about the definitive low definition quality of tape that gets under one’s skin. Tape is often not only considered in terms of sound, but also in the tactile nature of the object itself. When this happens, attention focuses instead on tape as part of the material media, not just a means of production.</p>\n<p>The latest record to honour the tradition of tape is <em>Twine</em>, a joint project between Taylor Deupree and Marcus Fischer. The method employed for this album is modest, with only two mono tape loops and four acoustic instruments. Each sound on <em>Twine</em> creaks and groans like a broken gramophone. There are moments of clarity with the soft twinkling of ‘Telegraph’ or the mournful hums of ‘Kern’. But every time the sound attempts to actualise itself, it is never fully realised. It exists instead within a strange liminal nether-zone; as a half-manifest idea.</p>\n<p>This gives the album enormous room for imagination. In the brilliant series ‘Reasonably Sound’, Mike Rugnetta discusses the function of tape as a window into the unconscious. Discussing the pseudoscientific ‘subliminal tapes’ of the 90s, he claims:</p>\n<p><em>“I think for more people than we tend to recognise, mysticism is there in the tape, the cassette, the recorder, the machine and the medium itself. Does a subliminal self-help vinyl record seem ridiculous to you? What about a subliminal self-help CD? Or MP3? They seem ridiculous to me. Of all these media, tape has such life; the format itself has this personality. The sway of the iron oxide coating and the hiss and something about the whole mysterious and particular way of the tape itself.”</em></p>\n<p>The argument put forward is that the subliminal cassettes could have only worked <em>as</em> tapes. Digital formats simply wouldn’t have had the same spiritual pull. These features of the unconscious are also present on <em>Twine</em>. The pitch flux, tape hiss and asynchronous looping all contribute to the romantic and evocative lure of the album. It sounds less like a modern record from a pioneering label, and more like a piece of nostalgic memorabilia.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/141666937?color=ffffff&portrait=0\" width=\"568\" height=\"319\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>At its best ambient music can gaze outwards and evoke the great unknown of the cosmos, and simultaneously provide the stimulus for an inwards journey into the psyche - an exploration of the notion that in each mind is contained the whole universe. It's greatest leaps occurred in the early 1970s, acts like Popul Vuh, Tangerine Dream and Klaus Schulze all venturing into the beatless electronic unknown before the actual term 'ambient' was widely popularised by Brian Eno after some lengthy sessions with Cluster's Deiter Moebius and Hans-Joachim Roedelius.</p>\n<p>Throughout the genre's many developments, the 1990s was arguably one of the most pivotal. Through a period of widespread sonic experimentation in electronic music, improving/cheapening electronics led to all manner of stylistic combinations, some terrible, some genius. The latter half of the decade saw techno begin to branch out into ambient, acts like Gas, Fluxion and Vainqueur incorporating heat-soaked soundscapes into the infinite march of 4/4 drums. An interest in the genre was similarly shown by some of the biggest pinups of British electronic music, such as Aphex Twin or The Orb.</p>\n<p>To begin our latest series looking at past records from different musical movements, ‘Echo Spaces’, we decided to compile three cuts from the 1990s’ ambient indulgences. This list is certainly not meant to be a reduction of the decade's greatest ambient achievements, just three slightly lesser known highlights we thought might be worth shedding light on.</p>\n<p>###Steve Be Zet – <em>Archaic Modulations</em> (Recycle or Die, 1993)</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D0PbGuFjJDY?rel=0&controls=0&showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>Stevie Be Zet’s <em>Archaic Modulations</em> is an intimate listen that seems to address the listener personally, yet which is spiked with the coldness of distance, of the scale of things that outstrip us in space, time, and comprehension. On a more earthly level, <em>Archaic Modulations</em> is one of a series of under-appreciated ambient records from the 1990s on short lived German label Recycle or Die. Although Stevie Be Zet, alias of Steffen Britzke, often produced techno and trance (new age track titles such as ‘Maya &amp; Aliens’ are a giveaway), <em>Archaic Modulations</em> benefits from being largely beatless, foregrounding Britzke’s lush melodies. The fantastic album artwork – a painting by Elisabeth Ernst – hazily depicts a subway train facing into the black abyss at the end of the platform. This metropolitan scene is devoid of any recognisable faces, and the music on <em>Archaic Modulations</em> likewise captures the sense of urban isolation in a world of machines that has been a theme of electronic music since Kraftwerk’s ‘Computer Love’.</p>\n<p>Words by Robert Heath</p>\n<p>###DATacide - <em>Flowerhead</em> (Rather Interesting, 1995)</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GlJqdwk0XIg?rel=0&controls=0&showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>Given the ultra-digitalised, quick-witted musings of the Atom™ project, you'd probably be surprised to know that the man behind the project, Uwe Schmidt, was the co-author of DATacide in the mid-90s, a fairly unashamed exploration into the more psychedelic side of electronic music. If you needed any convincing, just take a look at their album covers - they make Pink Floyd sleeves look like office ceiling tiles in comparison. Between Schmidt and his collaborator Tetsu Inoue, the project ran through the mid-to-late 90s, getting progressively weirder with every release, culminating in <em>Ondas</em>, which features everything from squeaking electronics to lip-trumpet solos. It is with their 1995 album <em>Flowerhead</em> where Schmidt and Inoue really seemed to land on their niche however, amalgamating glacial ambience, stargaze techno and a love for electronic eccentricities into a full length which has as much in common with free-jazz and '60s psychedelia as it does chin-stroking electronics.</p>\n<p>Words by Theo Darton-Moore</p>\n<p>###Biosphere - <em>Substrata</em> (All Saints Records, 1997)</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Q-u_tIzJAY?rel=0&controls=0&showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><em>Substrata</em> cemented Biosphere as founder of the ‘arctic ambient’ sound. A mountain-climber himself, many of the sounds on this album are field recordings atop Norwegian summits. The record itself centres on themes of solitude, memory and the bitter cold. In the same way that Joy Division sounded somehow dead and empty, <em>Substrata</em> also has an oddly ‘icy’ timbre that gets right to your bones. Each surge of sound is like a blast of wind in a vast tundra.</p>\n<p>There is also a strange psychological element to the record. Mythical quotes are woven throughout from Twin Peaks and recordings of a Russian Telepathist. Debussy once wrote that the job of musicians is to have the listener “dreaming of an imaginary country […] one that cannot be found on the map.” <em>Substrata</em> does just this; linking arctic settings with undertones of the subconscious. The crooning on ‘Poa Alpina’ and the soft gusts of ‘Kobresia’ leave you longing for a place you have never been.</p>\n<p>Words by George McVicar</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>There appears to be no end to Yaporigami’s output. With each new release, we get a glimpse into another dimension of his character. His latest export, <em>Eye / Hand</em> comes only two months since the brilliant <em>Homage</em> under his birth name, and barely over half a year since his last release on FF`Space, <em>A Hectic Truer</em>. Where <em>Homage</em> was limited to just six delicately unfolded pieces, <em>Eye / Hand</em> sprawls 27 quick-and-dirty track over 90 minutes. Apart from the two sides to the album, it also forms a mesh of two kinds of composition. First, there is the familiar, warped dance-floor sound of Yaporigami. These appear to be playing a game of Dadaist cut-up; ‘What it Was’ or ‘Her Hand Tenderly’, for example. Strung together, though, they weave an inviting narrative: “At First — Glance I Fell — In Love — With You — I Couldn’t —Figure Out — What it Was — I Wanted — To Hold — Her Hand Tenderly — I Wasn’t — Thinking Of Taking — Your Clothes Off”.</p>\n<p>However, there are also some novel, miniature sonic experiments, running at or below the one-minute mark. These cover everything from musique concrète oddities to out-and-out harsh noise. We are given moments ‘away’ from the meat of the album to recollect our thoughts, highlighted by synonymic titles in parentheses: ‘(Lull)’, ‘(Interval)’, ‘(Respite)’ and so on. This gives the album a great sense of exploration and scope, not dissimilar to the freedom that Drukqs or a Boards of Canada record held at the peak of their career.</p>\n<p>‘With You’ is a clear highlight; a cacophonous and violent drone that swirls around the stereo field in joyful unrest. ‘I Wanted’, too, is one of Miyashita’s bravest efforts, giving the Raster-Noton style a squelchy makeover. But yet, the album closes at its climax; ‘Your Clothes Off’ is a dazzling display of technical talent. This LP is not Miyashita's first excursion to tape. But it is his first attempt at creating a double-album, and has to be one of his most peculiar, versatile and challenging to date.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/229949237&color=8e8b8a&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>It seems fitting that the debut performance of Prequel Tapes, was at the closing party of an event space taken over by developers. His debut LP, <em>Inner Systems</em>, possesses a nostalgic, post-rave quality - whilst certainly not a dancefloor offering, the album displays hallmarks of club-culture at every turn. Faded shuffles of percussion, glimmering arpeggios and penetrating low-end are all present, albeit distorted by Prequel Tapes' heat-warped filters.</p>\n<p>Where the artist behind the project comes from exactly is unclear, however the announcement for the release combs over his enduring passion for the grittier sound of Britain in the 1980s/'90's - Clock DVA, The Cure and Future Sound of London just a few of the artists referenced as an influence on the record.</p>\n<p>With <em>Inner Systems</em> due out via R'Coup'D Records (a subsidiary of Warp) on the 13 November, we decided to glean a little more about the influences behind Prequel Tapes, inviting him to contribute to our That Time When series, discussing five of his most memorable gigging experiences.</p>\n<p>##1 Stuttgart_1987</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/750/22954288572_929c67daaf_b.jpg\" alt=\"stutt\"></p>\n<p>This was my first big concert, and it was a hell of a surprise. It was the Depeche Mode concert for the 'Music for the Masses' tour. I was insanely happy that I had got a ticket to see my heroes that day. I had no idea that I would leave the concert with new heroes however, as neither the ticket or the concert posters said anything about the support act.</p>\n<p>So here we go, Stroposkop on and the support act Front 242 hit the stage, firing up music the likes of which I had simply never ever heard before. Maybe it’s hard to understand today, but  it was a hell of a blast. The crowd went insane, it was like a hurricane hitting the venue and 10,000 people went bonkers. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing &amp; listening too. From that day on it was carved in the stones that I wanted to make music. I felt like being on a roller-coaster at full-speed; unbelievable and unforgettable. Even today I still am so happy that I got to see Front 242 at the peak of their career.</p>\n<p>##2 Stuttgart_1989</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/766/22954287322_970c6b7740_b.jpg\" alt=\"stutt2\"></p>\n<p>The Klinik are another Belgian band that influence me deeply even today. Seeing them live for the first time was spooky and somehow very arty. They where dressed as mummies, but wearing both black leather jackets. It was an amazing performance. The show was backed by a huge screen where they projected cut edits of splatter and horror movies.</p>\n<p>##3 Berlin_2001</p>\n<p><img src=\"view-source:https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/708/22575600409_dfe8a23363_b.jpg\" alt=\"a\"></p>\n<p>By 2001 I was not really into The Cure anymore, and I had seen them five or six times before. When my friend Noura invited me to go and see them perform the Trilogy concert though, it was a quick decision. They played all three albums in full, with a break between each. Listening to the full length versions of ‘Pornography' or ‘Disintegration' was mind-blowing and really beautiful. They have always been the biggest influence on me because of their early records, that had such a strong effect on me in my teenage years. From that day The Cure was back in my life.</p>\n<p>##4 Berlin_2001</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5685/22967761265_96b959cbc2_b.jpg\" alt=\"codi\"></p>\n<p>I don't remember really exactly what year it was, but it must have been around 2001. I went out with some friends for a proper rave weekend. And like nearly every weekend we ended up enjoying ourselves at the old Ostgut. It was a different nightlife in Berlin back then, it was about raving and less about showing off. That particular night I was going upstairs for a drink when the dancefloor of Ostgut called out to me with some superb, hard industrial techno. I was completely electrifying and I couldn't stop dancing for hours. On the decks it was Cora S. She was resident at the old Ostgut and an absolutely top notch DJ. I loved that Berlin. Wasteland Ravelands.</p>\n<p>##5 Berlin_2013</p>\n<p><img src=\"//c1.staticflickr.com/1/578/22345050314_19889b2602_b.jpg\" alt=\"vlad\"></p>\n<p>Seeing Sasu Ripatti aka Vladislav Delay performing in the gorgeous space of Kraftwerk for Berlin Atonal in 2013 was an honor. I have always have been a fan of his soundscapes and music, but his performance at the first of the new Atonal festivals, was next level. No intro, just straight into his expertly produced music. It was so honest, brutal and beautiful all at the same time, that it made me stop moving. I was just watching and following all the different transmissions, in a trance. Outstanding!</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/163716698&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>- Bob Bhamra in the WNCL Studios, West Norwood</em></p>\n<p>West Norwood Cassette Library is a good example of how broad a label can be without losing consistency. From the oddball, rave-era psychedelia of Ekoplekz to the jacking box-drum techno of Bobby Champs or dial-tone rhythmic experiments of Girls of The Internet, the label has kept a common thread, somehow or another. The range of styles covered by the label has differentiated WNCL exceedingly successfully, keeping your sonic palette fresh by bucking the trend with each release.</p>\n<p>The imprint was  inaugurated in 2010 with founder Bob Bhamra's 'What It Is', in what he described as a 'now or never' moment when we spoke with him earlier this month. &quot;The thought of starting a label had been in the  back of my mind for what seems like forever, but I never had the tracks  or the confidence to get started.  By 2010, after starting up a blog, a podcast, a stint back on the decks and an unhealthy amount of time in the studio, I felt that the time was  right to stop procrastinating and actually do something.&quot;</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/17667396&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>West Norwood Cassette Library is also the alias with which Bhamra uses for his own productions - a name arrived at by him and a friend in reference to his archiving habits. As he puts it himself it was &quot;a mildly affectionate ribbing of my obsessive filing  tendencies. If I had a pound  for every time I had to explain the origins of the name, I reckon I’d  have about six or seven quid by now.&quot;</p>\n<p>Although having resided in West Norwood for the past 15 years, Bhamra grew up just outside London, migrating to the city at the nearest possible opportunity. &quot;I was born in Slough which was a bit of a dump  although I have fond memories of my Dad taking me to Slough Record Centre on the way to Nursery School  and the permanent smell of Mars Bars wafting over from the massive  industrial estate&quot; he begins when asked of his early years.</p>\n<p>&quot;We moved down the road to Maidenhead which, on  the whole, was a bit more pleasant although less multi-cultural than Slough and not without a healthy dose of classic, suburban, mid-70’s casual racism. I spent a lot of my  school years keeping my head down and trying my best to be ignored… and the rest of the time skiving off Physical Education by hiding in the toilets with Jon Chambers (with whom Bhamra collaborates as Data 70) discussing record  sleeve design and mod revival bands. Naturally, when I was old enough, I moved to  nearby London and eventually ended up in West Norwood in the year 2000  because it was cheap. It’s all  pop up coffee shops now, of course. Whoopee.&quot;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/764/22366297064_b4cb58e89c_z.jpg\" alt=\"spatial\"></p>\n<p><em>- Spatial at the WNCL 5th Anniversary party, Corsica Studios, London 2015</em></p>\n<p>Having entered the world of electronic music pinching a 7&quot; single of Kraftwerk's 'The Model', and later various New Order and Electro 12&quot;s from his sister, Bhamra's exposure to music in the club setting followed whilst studying. Asked on his first encounter with the dancefloor, he acknowledges the missed opportunities in his local surrounding in a case of right place, wrong age. &quot;Skindles in Maidenhead, The Centre in Slough  and various empty warehouses around the M25 became legendary venues in  the early House days and later  on in the orbital rave scene. All on my doorstep and I didn’t go to any  of them. I wasn’t quite old enough for the grown up stuff, hardly ever allowed out and lacked the rebellious streak to sneak out of the house.&quot;</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/166599669&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>Continuing on the subject, Bhamra's actual early clubbing experiences were perhaps less notable than these might have been, but that didn't stop them from making an impression. &quot;I did my A levels in Windsor and the college  parties were held at a venue called The Old Trout. They were generally  pretty tame, dreadful music, DJ  was older than your Dad, that kind of thing. Until the night that some  of the older students took it over, filled it with dry ice and strobe lights and just played a bag of Chicago Trax records all night. I  remember getting drunk on Southern Comfort and Lemonade  (classy), throwing up and crying (ditto) but the music was just  mesmerising. A life changer, you could say.&quot;</p>\n<p>While many WNCL releases do fall into the realms of the dancefloor it is certainly not a requirement. Bhamra's own musical endeavours have covered everything from the foley-ridden ambient snapshots of his aforementioned Data 70 collaborations to the drumming he contributes to space-rock trio Sunray. The label's releases are reflective of that range, and the longer it continues the deeper the story seems to run.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/133295561&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>Across the imprint's five year history, Bhamra has managed a catalogue of 26 releases to date, despite the obvious pressures of running a vinyl imprint in the current climate. &quot;There’s been plenty of highs and lows,  naturally – who would have it any other way?&quot; he queries when asked about the most pivotal moments of the last five years. &quot;The highs are nearly always meeting producers, getting to hear amazing tracks, making new friends. The lows are generally the grown up  stuff or people not playing ball. Even in this tiny, cottage industry  branch of the music industry, you can’t completely escape the sharks and  ne’er do wells. In terms of releases, all of them appear to be  have been critically well received. Whether they sell anything is a different matter entirely.&quot;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5746/22963018146_d3d8d37b60_b.jpg\" alt=\"vyl\"></p>\n<p><em>- WNCL021: Ekoplekz &quot;Rock La Bibliotek&quot; EP</em></p>\n<p>There have been a number of repeat appearances on the label, however it is equally open to newcomers, both in terms of their relationship with Bob, and their prior release history. &quot;More often than not, I’ll approach a producer  that I’m completely mad about in the hope that they’re interested in  working with the label&quot; Bhamra adds.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/65297593&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>&quot;It’s all  about the tracks for me though – regardless of whether the artist has a  high profile or is a complete unknown. I often get sent demos and do my best to check  and feedback on everything and, while the quality of productions is  often of a very high standard (much  higher than my own) it’s rare that I find releases this way. There’s a  lot of decent unsigned tracks out there’s but, again, decent doesn’t  really cut it when you’re looking to release something. I’m looking for magic!&quot;</p>\n<p>After a series of 10&quot; two trackers between 2010-2012, making up the first ten releases on the label, Bhamra migrated to the 12&quot; format, allowing him to showcase artists in a fuller way,  commencing with Kevin McPhee's wonderfully chaotic 'In Circles' EP. Following releases from Spatial and the then newly formed Kamikaze Space Programme project from Chris Jarman also highlighted a penchant for distorted percussive experiments, without stinting on funk and groove.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/43249124&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>Asked if he would consider an album length release on WNCL, Bhamra seems content with the current formula for now. &quot;There are notable exceptions but mostly I find  dance/electronic-oriented albums quite dull and predictable&quot; he considers.</p>\n<p>&quot;I’m not  averse to the idea of releasing  an album if it totally blew me away but the chances of that happening  are slim. Unless someone can lend me the money to put Knowing Looks into  Abbey Road Studios with the London Philharmonic Orchestra.&quot;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5817/22963017696_952d72a053_z.jpg\" alt=\"mora\"></p>\n<p><em>- Knowing Looks Jnr (aka Mora The Explorer)</em></p>\n<p>Neatly, the latest release in the series WNCL025, marks the 5th Anniversary of the label, comprised of various tracks Bhamra has been asked for by followers of the Library over the past few years. &quot;There’s not a huge public demand for WNCL stuff but the people  that do support the label are generally very committed and sincere so  it’s nice to acknowledge that support&quot; he says of the thinking behind the release. 'Blonde on Blonde (Dunkel VIP)' was a  dubplate-only thing that I cut for a label night that Teal Records (the  label that released the original) had  put on in Copenhagen. 'Say What?' originally came out on Adam  Marshall’s New Kanada label. He asked the artists on the label to turn  in an ambient/beatless piece of music  that conjured up a park or green space in their area for a compilation  he was planning called Ambient Parks. I just so happened to be working  on a beatless version of 'Say What?' but, unsurprisingly, it didn’t  really fit the vibe of his release.</p>\n<p>&quot;I still  maintain that, for better or for worse, it  could be the soundtrack for a park in West Norwood. At night. 'Think (It Ain’t Illegal Yet)' is another  dubplate from the vaults and 'Up Periscope!' was originally earmarked to  be the B side of WNCL001.&quot;</p>\n<p>WNCL025 is available now via the WNCL Recordings Bandcamp page below:</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 570px; height: 690px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1294708743/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/tracklist=false/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://wnclrecordings.bandcamp.com/album/wncl025\">WNCL025 by WEST NORWOOD CASSETTE LIBRARY</a></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Saturday evening, and the setting is quite different to the previous night's - the superficial glitz of a freshers filled nightclub. I am in the basement of Dalston's Power Lunches, and my feet are sticking to the floor due to some unknown substance as I watch the stage between dread-locked heads. At the bottom stands four video players of different shapes and sizes, telling the morbid tale of a throwaway society, depicting mindless consumerism and merciless investor development between flashes of static. Even the event's name, 'Towards Collapse', seems to point an angry finger at the unstoppable churn of London's development cycle.</p>\n<p>As I walk in 'DJ Bin Fetish' is on stage... If the name weren't enough entertainment value on its own the joyous selection of grating drones and doom-laden, slow-motion techno he conjured up over his 45 minute slot certainly was. Next on stage was Brighton-based John Wheatley. His curatorial skills as owner of Cutting Room Records have earned him coverage in esteemed publications such as The Quietus and a regular show on Future Music FM. However, it was a rare live outing from under his Microbes alias that warranted his attendance on Saturday. Groaning shockwaves of bass, crushing drones and ceiling scraping high-end carved out narratives for an imaginary cyber-thriller in the line with the noise-punk stylings which comprised his debut cassette release back in 2012.</p>\n<p>Having seen Shelley Parker a few weeks ago in the now sadly endangered Rye Wax in Peckham (<a href=\"http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk:8190/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=makeComment&amp;keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9562425\">sign here please</a>), I was at least somewhat aware of what to expect. However, Parker's ability to fill a room with sound never seems to lose its thrill. Indeed, the soundscapes she crafts seem to transcend the borders of the basement venues she has been occupying lately. I can imagine her productions sounding just as powerful, infectious and visceral in the Tate's Turbine Hall or Kraftwerk Berlin's colossal atrium. For now though it’s a pleasure to see her play wherever possible, treading a satisfying balance between dirt-caked noise and skippy breakbeat techno not letting either outstay its welcome and leaving you wanting more each time.</p>\n<p>It was credit to the scheduling of the event that Parker's dancefloor oriented approach broke the tension of the previous beatless proceedings at the perfect moment. Huron continued with pointed rhythmic experiments, presenting a plethora of broken-beat glitch, celestial ambience easing between the data-moshed soundscapes at various interims.</p>\n<p>Towards Collapse are only a couple of events into their series, however it's already pretty easy to gather a sense of what they're about. They have also recently put out a cassette release with another Cutting Room Records affiliate, K (no) o, and Cloaks member Submechanical generating plenty of anticipation as to how the project might develop. So while the incessant grind of development crushes on, its good to know there are still people out there who choose to confront, rather than ignore it.</p>\n<div id=\"fb-root\"></div><script>(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_GB/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3\";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script><div class=\"fb-video\" data-allowfullscreen=\"1\" data-href=\"/TowardsCollapse/videos/vb.493802600746948/646411288819411/?type=3\"><div class=\"fb-xfbml-parse-ignore\"><blockquote cite=\"https://www.facebook.com/TowardsCollapse/videos/646411288819411/\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TowardsCollapse/videos/646411288819411/\">Towards Collapse #1 Visuals</a><p>Busy times at the sub-standard, elephantiasis priced and bed-bug infested magnolia-box rental that is Towards Collapse HQ.

    "content": "<p>It's hard to paint an accurate picture of Christoph de Babalon. Not least because almost all of his press photos are shot in grainy black &amp; white. The late John Peel placed one of de Babalon's earliest releases,  <em>I Own Death EP</em>, in his 1994 end-of-year list. Two years later, de Babalon was taken under the wing of Digital Hardcore Recordings (DHR), a fringe label that specialised in some of the harshest and most abrasive contributions to music in recent memory. It was here that he first caught wider public attention.</p>\n<p>His debut on the label, <em>If You’re Into It, I’m Out Of It</em> is something of an unsung classic.   The album's high contrast artwork and ironic title capture of the mood of the time. On the one hand, it is cold and maths-y, like the Neo-Noir psychologism of Aronofsky’s <em>Pi</em> or Lynch’s <em>Eraserhead</em>. But it is also carries a certain swagger, an adolescent anti-everything nihilism. Thom Yorke even described the record as “the most menacing album I own”. de Babalon also consequently went on to support Radiohead on their 2001 <em>Amnesiac</em> tour.</p>\n<p>At this point, club music had reached an interesting juncture. The optimism of early rave had given way to a darker outlook. The smiley face of acid had morphed into a evil grin, and the melodic riffs and vocal hooks became displaced by yet more percussion and digital processing. This turn to the darkside produced some of electronic music’s most striking and heavy contributions. DHR were instrumental here, incorporating almost all aspects of ‘extreme’ music (punk, gabber, noise) into one glorious monstrosity. These releases have a bleak trajectory to them, as if written to accelerate the deterioration of social fabric. Take Atari Teenage Riot’s anarchic manifesto: <em>Burn, Berlin, Burn</em>, also released in 1997. This was music from the tail-end of Generation X: bitter and violent, its aims were the abolition of all culture and the creation of none. A self-destructive rush into a hot furnace of overdrive.</p>\n<p>It’s often said that while most genres develop as hybrids of two or more styles, jungle is more like a mutant. Tech-house or dub-techno are clear in their lineage, a cherry-picked composite of two distinct styles. But jungle, born out of techno and hip-hop and yet nothing like either of them, is a different beast. In 1992, Derrick May warned of this impending new genre as, “a diabolical mutation, a Frankenstein’s monster that’s out of control”.</p>\n<p>If jungle is a mutant, then Christoph de Babalon’s music is a mutant’s mutant. <em>If You’re Into It, I’m Out of It</em> is both hardcore and ambient at the same time, a combo Philip Sherburne described as “a hellishly compelling couple”. Just listen to the epic 15-minute opener, ‘Opium’, a track that predates the gothic ambience of artists like Demdike Stare. In fact, I dare say that DS directly lifted its chords, style and sound for their 2010 track, ‘Matilda’s Dream’…! But then there are explosive breakbeat experiments, like ‘Water’ and ‘My Confession’ that lash out like rabid Rottweilers. Too weird for a rave but too rave-y for the home, <em>If You’re Into It, I’m Out of It</em> exists in a netherworld that is still not understood.</p>\n<p>But to talk of Christoph de Babalon only in terms of his earliest work would be a mistake. Over a career spanning two decades, he has pursued styles from cinematic soundscapes to bitfucked breakcore, and the conceptual depth of his work requires considerable time and attention. <em>Scylla &amp; Charybdis</em>, for example, is a stunning, operatic record that de Babalon worked on for three years. The album uses styles influenced by Schönberg, Rachmaninoff and Strauss. His latest album <em>Short Eternities</em> pays tribute to both his jungle origins and his fondness for the abstract. There are moments of hyperactive excess, but always with a stirring malaise lurking underneath. In celebration of de Babalon’s return, we caught up with him to talk juke, Tarkovsky and pessimism…</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5BwDXH_U_bM?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>Your very first record came out over 20 years ago now, how have you seen your attitudes towards music change, and how has culture responded to it since you first started playing?</strong></p>\n<p>I don't know. I can still be pretty enthusiastic about music; listening to it and making it and so on. But I guess, I am less easy to impress these days. Musically, I am mostly exploring the past. I don't really feel like I need to be up to date, if there is such a thing. Generally, I have been trying to make as much music as possible while staying as far away from the music scene as I possibly can. Or people in general... I like to be on my musical island. Something interesting will always wash ashore!</p>\n<p><strong>Seven years ago you released <em>Scylla &amp; Charybdis</em>, a concept album that at the time you described as the “most complex work [you] have ever done”. What, if any, are the conceptual markers on your new record? What should we listen out for?</strong></p>\n<p>I am happy with the monumental concept of <em>Scylla &amp; Charybdis</em> but doing this all the time would have been annoying to everyone. <em>Short Eternities</em> is just a number of tracks that work well together. I did not feel the pressure to re-invent myself. But I do think this record has it's very own poetic feel, which I have yet to put a name on. In parts there are pretty aggressive breakbeats, but mixed with the ambient tracks the albums gets a real sense of fragility.</p>\n<p><strong>I’ve really enjoyed your work in ambient in the past, and I’ve felt like jungle and ambient have an unexplored crossover outside of your music. What are your aims when trying to bridge the gap between the two genres?</strong></p>\n<p>I guess my idea is very simple. The mood is kind of similar, at least the general direction, in almost all my music. Some works just happen to have no beats, or not much of a rhythmic pattern. But they all want to drag you in, so to speak. Luckily, the fact that I do 'ambient' AND jungle is my slightly schizophrenic trademark.</p>\n<p><strong>I’ve read that you’re more interested in creating atmospheres in your music than anything else. “Music that really creates a world around you and in you” as you put it, and you cite inspiration from classical music, literature and the visual arts. Could you name some examples of things outside of music that have made a big impact on your work?</strong></p>\n<p>Earlier it was visual stuff like Arnold Böcklin, Gustav Doré, and I always liked Bosch and Bruegel with their intense atmospheres. In terms of books I would have to say Burroughs and Robert Anton Wilson. Oh, my!</p>\n<p><strong>…and film too?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, very much sometimes, especially films by Kubrick and Tarkovsky, but just as much as anything else. Like life in general.</p>\n<p><strong>A lot of your tracks stretch out to incredible lengths, I’m thinking in particular of the nearly 16-minute epic, ‘Opium’ that opens <em>If You’re Into It, I’m Out Of It</em>. Seems to be quite a rare format for someone working in your genre.</strong></p>\n<p>I agree, the choice to put 'Opium' as the first track was a brave decision made by the label DHR at the time. Probably, back then, I would not have dared to make that choice. So it was great, someone more reflected took care of it.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/143002293?color=ffffff&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>Would you say this is in some sense a reaction to the commercial nature of fast-paced music consumption today?</strong></p>\n<p>I guess, people want to listen to it because they can relate to the mood and they are looking for in these atmospheres. I will not be able to catch a fast paced person’s attention with my autistic musical project for very long anyway.</p>\n<p><strong>Could you maybe say a few words on where you see the future of Drum &amp; Bass? There was a time when D&amp;B and Juke seemed to making some kind of fusion, but I notice that you haven’t jumped on that bandwagon. Will the genre remain a relic, or is there still a resurgence waiting to happen?</strong></p>\n<p>Juke is fun, but I have no idea what is going on in Drum &amp; Bass these days. I am sure it will be around for a while, and that's totally fine with me. However, for some strange reason I never really felt part of Drum &amp; Bass. It did have a big influence on my work, especially the stuff from around ’94, when it was fresh and silly and producers weren't trying to 'make music'. But people got too anal about the whole production thing and the music lost its charm. I do not expect an established musical genre to re-invent itself; that would be confusing.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally, a lot of your work seems to hone in on the dark elements of life, and uses an extremely gritty sets of sounds to achieve some truly melancholic affects. You even once described life as “tragic and utmost brutal”. Would you call yourself a pessimist?</strong></p>\n<p>I really try to be positive, because being pessimistic is sometimes an easy excuse for not doing anything. But then I open the newspaper... and it seems the world is made of pain and sadness for most people. It is hard to be positive but it’s the only way.</p>\n<p><em>Short Eternities</em> is out now on <a href=\"https://lovelove.greedbag.com/buy/short-eternities/\">Love Love Records</a>.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/109631873&color=8a8a8a&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>After two earlier releases in their 'Argument' series for Haunter Records, label co-founder Daniele Guerrini and Matthias Girardi aka Weightausend are back asking difficult questions again. Following on from Somec's warped technoid reduction, 'Source of Uncertainty' a few months ago, the third part of their 'Argument' series as Cage Suburbia marks the first on 12&quot; vinyl, following the label's step up to the format late last year. 'Argument #03' sets itself at some distance from the skittering, modular experimentalism of Somec's release however, as this EP is brims with dancefloor charge. Every fibre of the release rattles and buzzes with energy, as if trying to escape its confines and run a million miles in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p>As usual, Cage Suburbia take the opportunity to stamp their anti-establishment views to the release inciting civil unrest with a series of stickers which accompany the record, as well as using quotes from Klaus Maeck's cult classic, 'Decoder' throughout opening track 'Copkiller':</p>\n<p><em>&quot;Information is like a bank. Some of us are rich, some of us are poor with information. All of us can be rich. Our job, your job is to rob the bank, to kill the guards. You go out there to destroy everybody who keeps and hides the whole information.&quot;</em></p>\n<p>Albeit a sideline to the music itself, it's encouraging to see artists using their voice to make their political stance overt at a time when contemporary music largely stays clear of such leanings. The track batters and clangs against itself, mad-eyed acid-loops burrowing diligently in the backdrop, before building to Cage Suburbia's data-moshed, reverberant transition into 'Black Ops'. It is one of the most gratifying things about the EP that it is pieced together as a whole, each offering overlapping the last with no room for silence. 'Black Ops' alters between clattering breakbeat and dozily swaying half-step in a mesh of rumbling, motor-engine drums.</p>\n<p>The EPs guttural tonal pallette is maintained to the last, 'The Vault' and '20134, 56 MI' exploring progressively more frenzied 4/4 abstractions. The former bumps forward like an off-road vehicle jolting across difficult terrain. The latter pushes things into overdrive, jacked-up cave-techno booming through an echoing mess of stuttered hi-end percussion and trembling chimes.</p>\n<p>All of Guerrini and Girardi's physical releases are cut from assorted jams with various machines and the live foundations of their working methods are as present as ever here. It is perhaps this that gives the Cage Suburbia project such persistent, jet-engine levels of energy, capturing various fragments in time without overworking them long enough to lose their riot-inducing charm.</p>\n<p>In the words of Haunter Records themselves, this is 'punk rock for the paranoid age'...</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/157351519&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.maykelloomans.com\">Maykel Loomans</a></p>\n<p>Drenched in an atmosphere most suited to nighttime and informed by the unpredictable nature of analogue machines, the music made by Other Form — real name Elliot Jay Stocks — could be loosely described as techno, but draws from a wide electronic palette, including the influence of his adopted hometown of Bristol. For Stocks, one of the main aims of his music is in conveying an atmosphere; “I’m not sure why it all turns out so dark, but it doesn’t ever seem right to listen to it on a sunny day!” Despite only a few months under the musical spotlight, his work has enjoyed support from Tommy Four Seven and Killawatt, the latter of which has also has collaborated with Stocks on a remix.</p>\n<p>Part of what is appealing to this sound is the heavy emphasis on the importance of impulsive creativity; “I’ve found that the most interesting results come from music that had been allowed to come about organically. As in: just start hitting keys and twiddling knobs and layering things up and seeing what happens&quot;, he explains. &quot;Hardware has played the most important role in that approach by far. There’s a spontaneity you get when using hardware that is very hard to find in software alone.”</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/217173822&amp;color=928f8e&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>Stocks is also editor of the nascent <a href=\"http://www.readlagom.com\">Lagom</a> magazine, a publication that “celebrates innovation and creativity” that aims to “tell the stories of the people whose jobs, side projects, hobbies, homes, studios, and way of life offer inspiration to others.” However, having made music in various guises for over a decade, Stocks’ new music as Other Form represents a decision to finally get serious: to silo his work as a designer and properly embrace this ‘other form’ of creativity. Stocks originally wrote music under his Skull Tubes moniker, a name that he says “had a kind of tongue-in-cheek ‘horror’ aesthetic to it.” But the decision to work under a new title was simple, “I wanted a different moniker to free myself of all the old stuff, and to represent the new way I was making music: that more experimental, organic approach”.</p>\n<p>The mix Stocks has provided traces his musical genealogy; mapping his multifarious influences and his projections into the future. “I wanted to showcase a lot of the music that has helped me find my place. Folks like Shifted and Regis blew my mind wide open&quot;. For Stocks, the recent foray into music is an exciting eye-opener; &quot;I wasn’t aware of most of these artists until about two years ago, when everything suddenly clicked and I realised: this is the music I want to make”.</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist:  </strong></p>\n<p>Yves De Mey - Box Caisson [Opal Tapes]<br>\nMønic - Morse [Tresor Records]<br>\nOther Form - Like Unknown Movements In The Mist [UNRELEASED]<br>\nDino Sabatini - Extraction [Prologue]<br>\nKillawatt - Onslow Road [Osiris]<br>\nVatican Shadow - Church of All Images (Regis Version) [Blackest Ever Black]<br>\nKillawatt - Black Air [Osiris]<br>\nOther Form - Oktober [UNRELEASED]<br>\nManni Dee - Nicotine Kisses [Osiris]<br>\nDrumcell - Disturbance (Tommy Four Seven version) [CLR]<br>\nShifted - Chapter 69 [Our Circular Sound]<br>\nManni Dee - Sister Nobody (Mønic Version) [Osiris]<br>\nSigha - Loop 4 [Avian]<br>\nCodex Empire - Kingsevil [Aufnahme + Wiedergabe]<br></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?embed_type=widget_standard&embed_uuid=fba05e44-1756-4ae5-8769-f74f0c9f9f15&feed=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0054-other-form%2F&hide_cover=1&hide_tracklist=1&replace=0\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><div style=\"clear: both; height: 3px; width: auto;\"></div><p style=\"display: block; font-size: 11px; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px; padding: 3px 4px; color: rgb(153, 153, 153); width: auto;\"><a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/0054-other-form/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=base_links&utm_term=resource_link\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:#808080; font-weight:bold;\">0054 // Other Form</a><span> by </span><a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=base_links&utm_term=profile_link\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:#808080; font-weight:bold;\">Stray Landings</a><span> on </span><a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=base_links&utm_term=homepage_link\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:#808080; font-weight:bold;\"> Mixcloud</a></p><div style=\"clear: both; height: 3px; width: auto;\"></div>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo Credit: Madison Dinelle, 2014</em></p>\n<p>Despite his fairly concise release history, Grischa Lichtenberger is an artist who somewhat defines Carsten Nicolai's Raster-Noton imprint for me. His work is both intriguing and beguiling in equal measure, feeling as much about process as it is results. Having been brought up in Bielefeld, Lichtenberger’s compositions are often referenced in the context of artists like Autechre or Aphex Twin, yet have a sense of being developed in isolation, without too much care for what is popular in the wider world of electronic music.</p>\n<p>With his most recent LP, <em><a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/reviews/la-demeure-il-y-a-peril-en-la-demeure\">La Demeure; il y a péril en la demeure</a></em> having been released recently and a following EP to follow shortly, we decided to catch up with Lichtenberger to discuss the composition of the album, working with Raster-Noton, and the benefits and shortcomings of social networking. Much like his releases, Lichtenberger's answers beg as many questions as they answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Hi Grischa, so first off how are things? You put out 'La Demeure; il y a peril en la demeure' recently, your first album in three years. I was reading <a href=\"http://trashaudio.com/2013/10/workspace-and-environment-grischa-lichtenberger/\">this</a> piece of text by you where you reference the two concepts - can you tell us a bit more about their translation and why you chose them as a reference point for the album? </strong></p>\n<p>The titles for my albums are less conceptual, pre-thought ideas, but more sentences which are strangely attracting to me, in which all the things that have happened during the process of production return to. It's like I’m weaving a web, but in the end, I never find a way to recall the paths of all the strings, yet I still have the feeling that it holds together somehow.</p>\n<p>In a way this is pretty much in line with the ideas that grew under the title 'La Demeure; il y a péril en la demeure’: at its core it is a discussion about historic elements that could never be told thoroughly. La Demeure translates as the shelter, the den, the home. A retreat, withdrawal, but also a safe haven, a refuge. Some sort of special empowering place in the world, a dwelling. It is a term I first encountered while reading Emmanuel Levinas' 'Totality and Infinity' a few years ago. The book is separated into two parts; in the first he develops a notion of 'the other' as a transcendent force that precedes any ontological construction. That means that for Levinas, an encounter with the other is a metaphysical notion that excels any immanent theoretical elaboration. If the theory forgets about this dependency it arouses the suspicion to suppress, thus being comparable with political totalitarianism. It would become a theory that forgets about the past lying beyond it's own restrictions. Levinas' experience as a Jew in WWII conflicts heavily with Heidegger’s ontology, not only because of the direct associations between him and the Nazis, but on a deeper level, because of a heroistic and thus egoistic concept of self empowerment (Selbstergreifung des Daseins) that excludes the role of the other completely. For Heidegger the home, the house, the homeland (heimat); all these mythological flesh-and-blood relationships are of great importance and leads him close to the neo-theological concepts of heritage and race in German fascism. They serve him as a retreat from the other, as a solicitad island of reflection and contemplation (Einkehr).</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/224490177&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>In the beginning of the second part of Levinas' book he develops a different concept of the home, or the dwelling (as it is translated). Very much bound to the ethics of 'the other', the home is no longer the somewhat grim, obdurate encounter with the other as a transcendent metaphysical force (as in the first part of the book), but an encounter of friendship (Heidegger stays quite voiceless on the matter of the fellow human being, the Mitmensch). For Levinas it is of great importance that there is this mercy of 'the other' - who gives shelter, who provides, cares and caresses the ego.</p>\n<p>For me it made sense to connect these ethical dimensions to art. There is something uneconomical in the communicative exchanges art provides. Apparently some things are shared that are not reducible to immediate consumption. This is I think, closely connected to this trace of 'the other'. For me the question of the so-called 'inner motivation' for making art was a massive grey area. Sometimes the motivation is explained as the simple necessity of a genius - someone who seems to be unexplainably good at something and just 'needs' to become an artist or it is explained as a somewhat pathological passion. There seems to be something in art that exiles the behaviour of the artist from the normal functions of living. The exile, that provides the artist with these 'special' abilities to trigger communication with non-explicable aspects, was for me always closely related to something quite intimate. It is like a traces of memories or ghosts that build an ethical vessel sustaining the art on it's uneconomical side, and the demeure-figure triggered that idea perfectly.</p>\n<p>I then came to realise that this intimacy maybe focuses too much on production and less on communication (an identification and reflection of the artist, but not of the art). There is this tension between illustration and illusion so that this exile is building up a crisis. Art can be stupid and meaningful at the same time. That’s where the second part, the saying ' il y a péril en la demeure' comes into play. The juristicial term translates in English to ‘exigent circumstances’. The peril, the danger, the crime that is going on in the dwelling, in the private area, makes it necessary for a public entity to intrude, to secure, to save. It is also related to saving evidence (as the evidence of the critical struggle inside the intimate exile of art) as it connects to saving the exiled entity itself from being sucked away by the peril it is entangled in.</p>\n<p><strong>How does the album's artwork tie into this as well? Was this something you designed yourself?</strong></p>\n<p>The origins of the series' artwork are some drawings I made last year. Drawing is a sort of thought-process for me, where you would not only drill a hole in the problem that is before you, but you would mark the space surrounding it. So I could not really say, this is an illustration or a map of this and that (of the demeure), but the drawing is concerned with these ideas and the proceedings of the drawing itself tell something about the problem. I also had the feeling that, while I was always looking for a connection between the different mediums I’m using (music and painting, installations and texts), drawing actually showed something of every different media, and aesthetically, worked well with the music.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5830/22679276964_b7194054e1_z.jpg\" alt=\"demeure\"></p>\n<p>When it came to converting these into the finished album design, Olaf Bender from Raster Noton helped a lot. It was his idea to use this simple cardboard box as a case to underline a certain roughness and forwardness in the material, and he also found time to arrange the printing and the typography (which I really suck at).</p>\n<p><strong>Going back to the title, your albums seem to have very strong themes laid out for them - <em>and IV (inertia)</em> refers to 'a fictionalized successor of the baksan neutrino telescope in the caucasus region' and this new series focuses on the 'La Demeure' and 'il y a peril en la demeure' concepts. By contrast however, you have stated previously that you aren't keen to name your tracks as doing so would pre-define the listeners experience of them. Is the idea then to make the listener consider the work as a whole rather than to focus in on individual tracks?</strong></p>\n<p>Hmm, maybe. Interesting how this spells an incoherence for you. No, honestly I am not sure about that. I think the themes (like '~Treibgut' or <em>Andyrchie IV</em> or now, <em>La Demeure</em>) work for me as larger containers, in which a whole bunch of things find their place (all of my artwork in this certain 'period' are gathered under these themes, not only the albums), while the track titles (as they are mostly dates or refer to other organisational elements) have a practical meaning for me. The connection between the larger container and the things arranged under them needs to stay a bit loose for me - I don't want to illustrate an idea with them. At the same time I hope that the titles of the album don't impose a certain understanding on the tracks, of course this must happen to a certain degree, but I hope they work in a more open way than as a strict reduction.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/61366168&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>I like the aspect of thinking about the &quot;work as a whole&quot;, as you said, and maybe the reason really lies there. I have something to say that is inexplicable other than in the form they appear (music, writing, visual etc), but to organize them, to hold them together, needs thinking about for me. A reflection that says: &quot;it's worth doing it because of this and that reason&quot;, and that is the organisation provided by these different themes. I couldn't just say 'well this was 2013 and that's it'. I don't think it's self-explanatory to do these things at all (while there is a destructive criticism lurking around in me), so I’m constantly reinterpreting myself, thinking about the legitimization. Why do I like this thing I made and not another thing? Each track also has what I call 'strategies' applied to it that are sometimes marked in their titles. For instance, ‘Degrid Skt’ is a notation of a grid-less sequencing process, 'B Palcamp Rm' involves a parallel compression process, while '614 12' is simply a track from the 12th June 2014.</p>\n<p><strong>I was looking at some of the visual pieces on your Vimeo account which seem to blend raw filming with electronic manipulations - much as your music does. What do you think it is about the contrast between these two things you find so interesting?</strong></p>\n<p>I always liked a certain materiality with things: stuff, fabric, matter. I grew up with Joseph Beuys' fetishism of fat and felt and all that stuff. At the same time I loved recording things, collecting and gathering - just as digital systems can do so easily today - collect data and make it reappear on command. I guess what is interesting for me in combining them is to have them collide - the material as a trace of memory, when you collect and record it and then manipulate the digital recordings so that you have a sort of changed substance. But maybe it is something even more psychologically determined - the workshop of my father always provided the best instruments to play with, so it seems quite natural to play with the tools, not only the matter itself.</p>\n<p>On another note I think this connection is especially interesting in present times. You have huge amounts of data, but less and less memorable things - I guess the interest in this collision of the physical and this elusive 'digital-ness' is also a concerned resistance or at least a troubled product of this problem.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/583/23199339102_e06871e7d1_z.jpg\" alt=\"grischa\"></p>\n<p><strong>One thing that has struck me listening to your mixes is the breadth of genres you feature in them. Would you say the selections you make in your mixes are generally representative of your listening tastes? I read you listened to a lot of guitar based music growing up - what was the first music you really fell in love with?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m not sure how to answer this. There have been washing machines that sounded quite primordial; there was Beethoven, there was Bad Religion and Nirvana, then Radiohead and June 44, then Tortoise and Autechre. I don't know, I can't really draw the line and say this was the most important, the first thing. They all stand out in a certain way - but the guitar music of the '90s - Grunge and the local post-hardcore scene in Bielefeld which my brother was involved in, had a very important influence on how I understood the emotion of music and the production means, as  home-recording was really elementary for all the small bands coming up around that time. <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw7kaRuNnes\">This</a></em>, for instance is a band my brother played drums in for some time, i still love to listen to this stuff from time to time.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/116144685&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>In your Electronic Beats article you mention using Myspace a lot and enjoying it as a creative space to share ideas. Do you think something has been lost in the thrill of those early communication/music sharing platforms? If so, why do you think that is? Why do platforms like Facebook fall short?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, I guess for me, when Myspace, Studivz and Flickr began, I had the desire to connect, to reach out to someone. The idea was that the people on these platforms could maybe understand what you were up to better than the people next to you on the subway. Now I think there is certain problem with these platforms, marking you as being disconnected if you are not part of them. While they still have the potential to actually connect people with each other, they also seem to increasingly focus on the idea of you being connected to them as well. Also, because of the large amounts of people and data, things tend to get lost. I guess I’m just too old now to get the idea of Twitter and the Facebook timeline, where everything is constantly swept away. You would need a super pretentious 'my life is my art' attitude to generate enough attention to be seen. While I do think my life is part of my art, I don't like this idea of pushing yourself to actually become a painting.</p>\n<p><strong>You also mention that Carsten Nicolai first contacted you using Myspace - Can you remember the first time you met in person? What was that like having only communicated online beforehand?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, at first I received an email, asking for a demo... I just couldn't believe it and thought someone was playing with me. The trust the people from Raster-Noton put in me is still difficult to comprehend for me and feels very much like unjustifiable luck. But over the years I have had some really nice, trust provoking encounters with them, meaning I consider them friends in a way. It stays in this double-bind, which is the same with all the friends I have - something unreal in the sheer luck that someone you like, likes you back.</p>\n<p>Anyway I remember playing in Rome at 'Electric Campfire' some years ago (the first time I ever played a live set) and Carsten (Nicolai) came over at the beginning and raised the volume on the desk saying: &quot;this needs to be louder.&quot;</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/112622463&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Do you feel more creatively free working with Raster-Noton than with others?</strong></p>\n<p>I certainly feel that I have an understanding with them - that this music-thing is not a solitary island of clubs, genres and styles, but a form of artistic expression. It is the bigger picture that makes my work more legit in spite of the fact I am not a trained musician.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally what's next for you? What can we expect from the next instalment of the 'La Demeure' series?</strong></p>\n<p>Next is the Spielraum EP on vinyl - I am very much looking forward to its release. The tracks on it evolved very fast (in comparison to the large amounts of time I needed to compose the album) and they have a certain directness to them I really enjoy. I hope you might as well.</p>\n<p><em>The Spielraum EP will be released on Raster-Noton in December.</em></p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/138709448?color=ffffff&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"570\" height=\"259\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>If you have ever tried withstanding one of John Oswald’s plunderphonic onslaughts, then <em>Workers</em>, the debut album from Mullr, may not sound too unfamiliar. This ought to be expected since Mulllr — real name Ryuta Mizkami and one half of Reshaft — describes himself as a ‘collagist’, which echoes the sound-collage ethos of the plunderphonic project. The melodies on this album are constructed from vast sheets of tidbit samples, squashed together in as many permutations as possible. It is therefore near impossible to tease out any discernible melodic hook or rhythm. The track names too, contribute to the dizzying sense of detachment. The tracklist is a litany of fragmented phrases, the contexts of which will never be known: ‘…and Crowded Trains’, ‘…and Excessive Drinking’, ‘…and Loss of Memory’ and so on.</p>\n<p>Yet despite its disjointed style, and the patchwork nature of the sound, the album as a whole stands as a towering monolith. Within the first few seconds, there is an overpowering torrent of noise that extends for the album's full 56 minutes. There is no silence between tracks, and no respite from the assault. Where many artists pause for a melodic release, or dynamic break, Mulllr leaves no air to breath. It feels like being vacuumed into a wormhole, where every iota of space has been sucked out. At times, I found myself laughing along with the record, so bold and striking are its dynamic movements. The result is an exhausting and astonishing workout.</p>\n<p>'Post-Japanoise' is a term that has been coined by Signal_Dada owner Shotahirama to describe the nascent trend in Japan of music that has hyperactive noise and glitch elements at a pop-music level of clarity and sheen. Where Japanoise used the harsh resonances of distortion and feedback to devastating effect, <em>Post</em>-Japanoise surrounds the listener with HD frequencies and rapid stylistic shifts. It’s exciting to think of <em>Workers</em> as part of this contemporary curve, but we ought not to pigeonhole it so quickly. Not least because the album has been released via Comfortzone, an Austrian-based label founded by Christina Nemec, better known as Chra and bass player to Shampoo Boy. Post-Japanoise itself is only just beginning to form some sort of cohesive whole, so it would be premature to begin signalling its developmental milestones. That said, if we one day find ourselves retrospectively examining the roots of something like ‘Post-Japanoise’, <em>Workers</em>, Mulllr and Reshaft will surely be among the first names to mind.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/228509880&color=959391&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>An hour or two of synth noodling is usually enough for most of us, but not for Brighton based Voyder collective apparently. The group’s live sessions together have reportedly lasted as long as 14 hours. From these initial foundations as a group of friends simply enjoying jamming together, the project has mutated to include live gigs, and most recently a frontier as a record label. The debut release comes in the form of <em>XXXXX</em> (co-released with Bedroom Research), by Cornwall based producer, VORRS.</p>\n<p>Each track on the LP is titled in bold, and it is this sense of brashness which should be expected from the release. As a Voyder member put to me when I asked why they didn’t press the LP to vinyl, ‘there wouldn’t be much point as the needle would jump straight off the record’. This album is about loudness, and it doesn't care how much it hurts your ears.</p>\n<p>There is something about how intentionally abrasive this album is that borders on the antisocial - the whole thing smells of burning rubber and it’s brilliant. Take centre piece ‘COMA BOY’ for example. If the track’s demented theremin tones weren’t disorientating enough on their own, VORRS’ crunching basslines and twisted breakbeat reductions certainly don’t help. Just as you think proceedings can’t get any more intense, the whole thing is hijacked by an added layer of distortion in the closing third, reaching a thunderous climax.</p>\n<p>Opener ‘V_R2.6’, title track ’XXXXX’ and ’MMMEAT’ are similarly feverish in their volumes, if you were to load this album into a waveform generator, you would likely be presented with ten impenetrable rectangular blocks. This said, there are some rare moments of clarity. 'BLACK SUN' for example provides something of the unexpected, giving way in its latter half to reveal a glimmering, bitcrushed organ refrain in a rare moment of Dead Fader brand tenderness.</p>\n<p>The album is not without a sense of humour as well - something rarely shared by others operating in the modus of full-throttle noise. ’KONGZILLA’ for example retains plenty of comic-book cheek sonically, squealing samples and chip tune melodies bursting between VORRS’ densely distorted rhythms.</p>\n<p>The release encapsulates a love of harsh sounds which arguably unites Voyder's members above all else, making it a fitting opener to their discography.  Given the material covered across <em>XXXXX</em>, I'm not sure how many future releases I'll be able to review before one of gives me a seizure, but I'll do my best.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/232876413&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Anastasia Vtorova, the artist behind Machine Woman seems like a rather well travelled individual. Her latest release bio tells me she is originally from Leningrad, Russia, yet her Discogs page reveals she was brought up in Nottingham, UK. Currently, Vtorova resides in Berlin, crafting noise and techno experiments that tread the line between '80s industrial pastiche and something decidedly more future-gazing. If there weren't enough geographical marker-points to consider already, Vtorova's latest release is entitled 'For Sweden', paying homage to the Scandavian territory on Peder Mannerfelt's 'Peder Mannerfelt Produktion' label.</p>\n<p>Hollowed out percussion and downcast atmospherics dominate the release. 'Very Kind Human Being' opens with crackling glitches, docile synths and absent minded humming - like some sort of Gregorian chant for the 21st Century. The EP seems to be decaying as you listen, as if it were some industrial machine committed to its final task before collapsing in on itself. Despite '10.8.15's skittish percussion for example the whole thing feels like a generator being awkwardly cranked into ignition. 'Yes 10.06.15' explore similar themes wearily gathering itself together in a broken metallic churning.</p>\n<p>The EP is constructed in such a way as to draw you in before unleashing its most abstract pieces. 'Liquid Metal' sees reversed hits dart between melancholic swells of ambience, before 'Why Where Is No Effects' delivers the final blow to your sanity. A multi-layered vocal sample is repeated at varying degrees of abstraction - detuned, warped and obscured in all manner possible.</p>\n<p>However it is the moments at which Vtorova blends her more avant-garde notions with something more conventional where the EP really shines in my opinion . 'Swedishmanwithtwoblackboxes' for example is a fantastic mixture of Radiophonic Workshop style sonic experiments and dial-tone techno - squelching lo-fi percussion and stumbling, grit covered kicks buckling under one another.</p>\n<p>As Mannerfelt himself put it, the language of the release is &quot;raw and direct&quot;, and if I am able to add a further point, consistent as well. It is this that gives Vtorova the ability to explore so many ideas without losing a distinct voice, a quality rare and worth commending.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/173221622&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Orla Wren is the project of Tui Wren who describes his sound as “combining the oldest, wonkiest and most organic of possible sound sources […] into melodies and textures of pinprick detail, revealing the antiquated isolation of the environments that have inspired them.” Indeed, his latest album, <em>Moccasin Flowers</em> captures the autumnal climate, surrounding the listener in a litany of naturalistic found-sounds and melodic trinkets. But yet, no single instrument ever comes completely to the fore. Instead, all elements operate together in an intimate push-and-pull, as if each sound were part of the same family. In fact, the instrumentation covers an enormous range of timbres. Modular synthesisers, ukuleles, glockenspiels all make an appearance, and it’s this electroacoustic exploration that defines Wren’s sound.</p>\n<p>The accompanying artwork for the album is immediately striking. Sara Galan merges the human body with living plant life. Tree roots and fruits intermix with hearts and limbs, giving a tactile, physical introduction to the record. The track names, too, follow suite. Titles such as ‘Weathered Wood, Pitted Stone’ or ‘Torn Bleeding’ sound as though they ought to belong to the songs of sentimental beardy folks singers. Yet upon listening, <em>Moccasin Flowers</em> feels closer to Taylor Deupree’s minimal 12k label than an Alex James cheese festival. That’s because, unlike the seemingly neverending nausea of neo-folk acts, Orla Wren’s music has teeth.</p>\n<p>Sure, at the surface level, the scene depicted by <em>Moccasin Flowers</em> is picturesque. Cellos, pianos and softly plucked acoustic guitars lull you into sedation. But to conceive of it as a record of serenity and peace would be a mistake. Listen beyond the veneer of tranquility and you can hear decay, rotting vegetation and the churn of bustling insects. There are background noises that creak with disquieting uncertainty, and frequencies of intense extremity. High-end pitches drive themselves into your eardrum, creating discordant juxtapositions of tone. In the same way that Animal Collective’s <em>Sung Tongs</em> masked horror movie dread with sing-a-longs and childlike yelps, Wren offers a vision of nature that is all-encompassing.</p>\n<p>You can buy <em>Moccasin Flowers</em> directly from his <a href=\"https://orlawren.eu/moccasin-flowers/\">website</a>, and it is also worth mentioning that there is currently a half-price sale on all of his <a href=\"https://orlawrenmusic.bandcamp.com\">Bandcamp releases</a>.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/162463049&color=999695&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Manveer Dheensa is best known for his productions under the nickname Manni Dee - hard and fast techno with one eye on the overdrive, the other on the dancefloor. His side-project, Nuances is the antethesis of that. A heavy use of foley, faded orchestral timbres and a reverb doused tonal palette typify the project best. This provides a welcome tranquility from the rough-shod warehouse thumpers he has contributed to labels like Candela Rising or Black Sun Records under the Manni Dee tag. <em>Preserve The Sanctity of Sound</em> spans six, heat-warped film-scapes for Bastakiya Tapes, a cassette label offshoot of Bedouin Records.</p>\n<p>The EP's track titles only serve to enhance the cinematic nature of the release; 'Her Daughter &amp; The 7.30 Train' or 'The Last Ten Seconds Of Life' dividing the release like chapters of a novel. Opener 'Faded To The Fringes' sets a world-weary precedent for the rest of the cassette, heaving choral timbres growing progressively more outspoken as the track builds to an amp-buzzing close.</p>\n<p>Loosely, the tracks could be considered in the same vein as William Basinski, Fennesz or Loscil - on the one hand warm and inviting, on the other feverish and cloying. 'I'm Going To Meet The One I Love' is a good example of this. Despite its rich tapestry of strings there is something conversely faintly nauseating about the way they sway to and fro, as if stumbling drunkenly on a ship's deck. As with many others on the release the track also possesses an opiate-like, slow-motion quality, also put to good use across closer 'A Gasp Of Cold Air'.</p>\n<p>In comparison 'Sleep On &amp; Dream Of Love' is positively full-throttle. It's shuffling, Burial-esque two-step rhythms are covered with swells of reverb, silk-spun reversed hits and oceanic rumbles. Prior to this we are treated to a notably more subtle percussive experiment - Dheensa uses timid static loops and wooden taps, as if someone were rapping their fingers on a desk nervously between Dheensa's feather light melodies.</p>\n<p><em>Preserve The Sanctity Of Sound</em> makes an impressive debut for the Nuances project, providing a selection of tracks which compliment each other beautifully, highlighting a certain fragility you'd be hard pushed to find on Dheensa's other assorted projects.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/237208157&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p><em>In-Between Spaces</em> is the latest collaboration between Porya Hatami and Darren McClure. Hatami hails from Sanandaj, Iran and describes his work as “explor[ing] the balance between electronics and environmental sounds, utilizing processed acoustic and electronic sources and field recordings.” McClure, by contrast, comes from Matsumoto, Japan, and describes his music as something that you can “zone out to and zone into.” But yet, both artists share a common love for the immersive quality of ambient music, and their attention to detail on <em>In-Between Spaces</em> is largely unmatched.</p>\n<p>It’s clear what McClure meant by ‘zoning in’ when listening to this record. Each track is a highly concentrated meditation on a small, fragmentary subtlety. In the same way that yoga instructors teach to focus on breathing to clear out all other stimuli, <em>In-Between Spaces</em> hones in on microscopic detail to silence any surrounding noise. It brings to mind the reductionist philosophy of John Cage’s <em>4,33</em>; take away the <em>music</em>, and what do you have left? The name of the record, <em>In-Between Spaces</em>, seems to make sense in this context. It’s not the usual stars of the show — melody, beat, bass — that we’re looking out for here. Rather, it’s the peripheral, unintended features <em>between</em> the rest that take centre stage.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth mentioning that the artwork comes from Martin J Thompson, designer of the Stray Landings website and SM-LL label owner. The covering image looks as though we are examining a hair close up to the face, such that it goes out of focus and blurred. This too seems to fit with the in-between-y nature of the record; shifting attention away from the Gestalt and more towards its component parts. But to characterise this album as one that is completely obscured would be a mistake. Indeed, at times the sounds come through clear and distinct, like the breathtaking electric pianos that underpin ‘Shapes of the Field’. However, it’s important to note that these moments work precisely because they’re unexpected. Just a simple piano chord amidst an ocean of noise suddenly makes it sound so refreshing and vital.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 307px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=233432836/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/artwork=none/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://darrenmcclure.bandcamp.com/album/in-between-spaces\">In-between Spaces by Porya Hatami & Darren McClure</a></iframe>",

But if you didn't need telling that Jackmaster, Seth Troxler and Ben UFO are actually quite good at spinning records, we've put together our own list of things that we felt were overlooked this year.</p>\n<p>Usually at this point we add in a disclaimer stating how our list is not supposed to be an exhaustive summation of the year and just some thoughts we had which may or may not mean anything (like when Jimmy Carr shrugs his shoulders in a 'what do we think of that' kind of way after telling a distasteful joke).

After an evening of childish antics, stealing tequila shots from the bar (sorry Butlins) and drunkenly arguing about Louis Theroux in the mini-arcade, the effect of Autechre's set was like that of a parent's reprimanding. With a room entirely pitch black, and almost no semblance of rhythm, melody or structure for the entire set, there was very little to do but stand dumbfounded and allow the chaotic sonic assault to run its course. The physicality of their sound feels almost unparalleled, and not in the slight bit dated; a rather amazing feat considering its been over 20 years since the inception of the project.</p>\n<p>Words by George McVicar &amp; Theo Darton-Moore</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/199996172&color=959595&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Helm // Olympic Mess</strong></p>\n<p>Formed during a period of chaotic touring, Helm’s second album on PAN lulls you into a state of distorted warmth.

My experience of melting into this album is failed by any description of it being ambient or background music.

The venue itself is staggering. Fringe artists perform beneath a halo of golden lights and religious statues. Everyone from William Basinski to Fushitsusha have played there, and each time the venue repurposes itself to fit the new occasion. For Grouper, the space became something closer to its original purpose: a place of contemplation. You could see audience members practically craning their necks to hear her whispered hymns. But if you held your breath, you could listen to her mournful murmurs and delay-drenched chords swimming around the pews. She sat cross-legged on the floor with almost no lighting whatsoever. So unless you were sat at the front-upper deck, seeing her wasn’t an option either. She finished without a word to the audience, and as she reappeared on stage, there were rapturous cheers for an encore. But Grouper is not that kind of performer. Noticing the expectant faces of the audience, she hurriedly took her shoes from the stage and skipped away into the distance, to the sound of sighs and laughter.</p>\n<p>Words by George McVicar</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/166857997&color=999897&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Rye Wax survives Development</strong></p>\n<p>For more than a year now, the basement record store/venue has consistently challenged everything I hate about club culture. It sells a range of interesting records, all cherished by lovely staff, and promotes local labels. Rye Wax is also possibly the only record store where I have never been made to feel uncomfortable as a woman. Like many other venues in Peckham, it was recently under threat from a luxury flat development plan. But Rye Wax would have been missed more fiercely than its neighbours, if only for it being a cheap (free or a fiver) and never over-sold space with a good system and great vibes. But more importantly, the basement showcases such a diverse range of events, from your local rock band to ambient dedicated Sundays. The format adopted by Rye Wax gives a much needed space for new residency to make an impact and allows parties to escape — at least momentarily — the endless international big DJ booking market.</p>\n<p>Words by Hortense Maignien</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/236471062&color=a09c9b&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>The Fear Ratio // Refuge of a Twisted Soul</strong></p>\n<p>The Fear Ratio. A collaboration between Mark Broom and James Ruskin, but not the kind you were expecting. Both artists are firmly cemented as stalwarts of the British techno scene, yet for this project the duo set aside their love of chugging 4/4 rhythms for twitching glitches, rumbling dubstep headnodders and skittish breakbeat cutaways. Even better perhaps is the fact their debut LP together, <em>Refuge of a Twisted Soul</em>, was released on Skam Records. Skam began in the early 1990s releasing work by acts like trip-hop trailblazers Boards of Canada, or illusive, Autechre featuring producer collective Gescom. Broom and Ruskin's previous EPs sounded a little like they were still trying to find their footing with The Fear Ratio, and as they firmly mark the step with <em>Refuge of a Twisted Soul</em>, they also pay homage to a label which was instrumental in the development of many of the sounds contained within it in the first place.</p>\n<p>Words by Theo Darton-Moore</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/200977409&color=959594&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Bedouin Records</strong></p>\n<p>Despite only having been launched two years ago, United Arab Emirates-based Bedouin Records have been behind what I consider to be some of the strongest releases of 2015. The likes of Ekman, Hieroglyphic Being and Bintus had some of their best output of the year on the label. Furthermore, an album from Ryo Murakami and the recent announcement of a mixtape from footwork producer Traxman shows that the label aren’t satisfied just putting out great techno. This sets a precedent for exciting developments in 2016, and has proved Bedouin to be one of the finest labels currently operating in experimental music.</p>\n<p>Words by Harry Murdoch</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/211585391&color=999695&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Teklife &amp; Hyperdub at Corsica Studios</strong></p>\n<p>2014 was a sombre year for footwork; 2015 demonstrated its resilience and vibrancy. We saw Rashad’s name continue to feature in a string of posthumous EPs and collaborations,  new releases from old timers like Spinn and RP Boo, an R&amp;B crossover, and a debut LP from DJ Paypal that pushed the genre further from its ghetto house roots, with elements of samba-esque percussion, electro synths, and moments that seems to wander (albeit at a frantic 160bpm) into jazzy experimentalism. Seeing the Teklife crew at Corsica in November felt like the culmination of many of these things. Ostensibly a launch night for Kode9’s latest album, there was no doubt—and judging by the number of Teklife t-shirts among the pilled up 20-somethings, presumably many others would agree—that Spinn and Paypal were the stars of the show. Tunes spanning the meta-genre of “UK bass” spun alongside fresh cuts of footwork, spliced with classics from both sides of the Atlantic (I can’t have been the only one to pick up on Spinn’s nod to jungle with Dance Conspiracy’s 'Dub War'), kept us dancing till dawn. With discussions of “appropriation”—a term that strikes to the core of dance music, for obvious reasons—occupying a significant place in today’s political landscape, the night also offered an insight into what cultural exchange can look like at its best: a coming together of disparate scenes and styles, unashamed to acknowledge their respective origins.</p>\n<p>Words by Amatia Lily</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/116381377&color=999695&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Jasmine Guffond // Yellow Bell</strong></p>\n<p><em>Yellow Bell</em> epitomised for me an entire temper of music that occupied my interest in the early months of 2015.

It was free and experimental, sometimes chaotic, sometimes not relevant, sometimes great.&quot; These were Dieter Moebius' words on the Zodiak Free Arts Lab when I was lucky enough to pose a few poorly thought-out questions to him for my dissertation back in 2012. The 'lab', famous for being frequented by the likes of Klaus Schulze and Tangerine Dream would become the setting for the development of a new band, Kluster, after two of it's founders, Hans-Joachim Roedelius and Conrad Schnitzler met Moebius at a steak restaurant he was working at in Berlin at the time. The group, later renamed as Cluster after Schnitzler's departure, played an unmistakably important role in the development of the electronic avante-garde. One of my favourite stories of Kluster is the release of their first records, struggling to find a label, they responded to a newspaper advert from a church organist interested in new music. They were offered a release on the grounds they included a short religious speech at the start of each side of the record; and so <em>Klopfzeichen</em> and <em>Zwei-Osterei</em> were born. Later, Moebius and Roedelius worked with legendary producers such as Conny Plank and Brian Eno, exerting considerable influence on Eno's experiences in Berlin. On our first trip to the German capital in 2010 we were lucky enough to see them both perform - needless to say they sounded as current and boundary pushing as ever. A significantly under-celebrated artist who will be sorely missed.</p>\n<p>Words by Theo Darton-Moore</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/45925536&color=999897&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Marsen Jules // The Empire of Silence</strong></p>\n<p><em>The Empire of Silence</em>, like much of Jules’ work, is a complete submersion into arctic ambient. Stretching over 94-minutes, you can’t help but feel totally immersed in his cold, eery world. The music itself is largely featureless, with expansive sheets of tone that stretch out like an infinite horizon. Every modal tension or harmonic contrast is fashioned to get under one’s skin. To plant itself in one’s memory and colour the mood for the rest of the day.

Parker has also graced plenty of venues around the capital this year, using various machines to conjour live-sets as dynamic and free-spirited as the subjects of her releases, without an Apple logo in sight. Of particular memory will be her performance at Towards Collapse's most recent event at Power Lunches, crafting a mesmerising set that encapsulated noise, drone, jungle and techno as if there were no distance between them.</p>\n<p>Words by Theo Darton-Moore</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/169719910&color=999796&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Holly Herndon live at Oval Space</strong></p>\n<p>I have no doubt Holly Herndon will continue to make important, resounding work for the years to come; having said that, a Herndon performance in 2015 is as time-sensitive as can be. With op-eds on technology and media more commonplace than ever, <em>Platform</em> was charged with zeitgeist, not only in its sonic vision but for its explicit political engagement with the the current state of digital art. It’s no surprise she didn’t tone anything down for the Barbican’s Illuminations series; joined onstage by Mat Dryhurst on visuals—highlights including the Queen swirling in a technicolour cityscape filled with pastel electric guitars and chicken wings—and Colin Self providing vocals, Herndon punched out extended versions of <em>Platform</em> tracks. “FUCK THERESA MAY” in white Helvetica may just be the best backdrop to unapologetically new beats; the crowd definitely agreed with me, as we all screamed agreement.</p>\n<p>Words by Rena Minegishi</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/209409251&color=999695&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Takuya Matsumoto</strong></p>\n<p>It doesn’t escape me that writing about a producer with but two releases to his name this year might seem a touch curious—but then given that the latest is only his eighth 12” since emerging in ’01, 2015 has arguably been a prolific year by Matsumoto’s standards. My first introduction came via 2014 EPs for Meda Fury and Royal Oak, which showcased a penchant for melancholic strings and delicate piano chords over gently skipping drums. This year, straightforward cuts like 'Be', 'Trash Track', and 'Coco' continued this arc, though elsewhere Matsumoto draws on a wider sonic palette—the chirping of birds in “On The March”, or steel drum flourishes of 'Rain Flower' — and forays into more experimental, jazzier arrangements can be heard. Throughout, his warm sound and intricate melodies prove thoroughly charming. Along with releases from SAI and Iero label boss/collaborator Kouji Nagahashi, Matsumoto’s success hints at the solidification of a new deep house sound in Japan—one very much of the legacy of Knuckles, Saunderson, et al., or indeed Parrish’s free jazz spirit, though equally reminiscent of fellow citizen Soichi Terada (whose early 90’s productions on Far East Recording were recently reissued), furthering the impression of a strong—if comparatively small—scene on the island.</p>\n<p>Words by Amatia Lily</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/135993918&color=959493&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n______________________________________________________________________________\n<p><strong>Beijing Miji Concert Series</strong></p>\n<p>Having spent all of my artless adolescence in a sheltered Beijing suburb, finding music was strictly an online ordeal for me. It was a strange—vindicating, even—pleasure to receive an invitation to Sub Jam’s concert series MIJI. The series takes place in a tiny brick-walled cube dubbed Meridian Space, tucked away behind rows of museums and galleries in west Beijing. Besides being a pun on MIDI, mì means 'secret' or 'close'; jí “concentrated” or 'perch'. MIJI No. 24’s line-up consisted of a Beijing duo, Liu Xinyu and Yan Yulong, and the Singaporean artist Yuen Chee Wai, who was returning solo from his band The Observatory’s European tour. I was excited to see Yan Yulong’s electric violin. Lines from Yan Jun’s essay came to mind:</p>\n<p><em>“I’m against amplifying pre-Machine Age traditional instruments… if they will die without speakers, then just let it die. Having said that … there must be some way to transform the old bodies of such instruments into machines.”</em></p>\n<p>I like seeing chamber instruments mechanised away from its canonized European context; it’s mischievous and romantic. Across from Yan, Liu Xinyu sat with a mixer and a guitar laid flat on his lap. Their set was slow-moving, subtle. Yan probably plucked his violin ten times over 20 minutes, and bowed less than that. Yuen Chee Wai broke the quiet continuum by dropping a huge metal screw on a contact mic. He moved firmly through an array of frequencies; amplified by the acoustics of the venue, the higher pitches sounded impossibly close to my eardrums; several times I plugged my ears to make sure it wasn’t just my ears ringing. He also managed to create an incredible special effect, as if the frequencies were swirling around me. As overwhelming as it all was, there was an organic beauty tethering the audience as Yuen breathed steadily into one of the microphones. And that’s how my sole musical memory of Beijing circa late 2000s—top 40 blasting from counterfeit JBLs under violet lights—were soon drowned away.</p>\n<p>Words by Rena Minegishi</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/213216517&color=9d9b9a&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Dean Blunt</strong></p>\n<p>Dean Blunt is certainly a performer. Constant streams of blinding strobe lights, impenetrable smoke and deafening drones that pierce painfully through the skull all make regular appearances. His live show is more involving than any theatre I’ve ever been to. I remember braving an opportunity to open my eyes just to see my friend with his hands covering his head which was being buried in his lap. The shows have also become notorious for charging men more for entry, on-stage security guards, nos balloons, and sending up ‘dummy’ Deans to perform the first half of the set. All of this contributes to a powerful commentary of the breakdown of relations with the environment he lives in, the clubbing world we all participate in, and the day to day rituals we’ve come to see as commonplace. I don’t know if we would give notice to anyone else putting on the same show, but his standout voice and music seem to lean us all close to listen to what he has to say.</p>\n<p>Words by Jo Kali</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/193851194&color=999695&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Project of Haunter Records co-founder Daniele Guerrini and Matthias Girardi aka Weightausend, Cage Suburbia has a feeling of spontaneity about it. Each of their productions begin with a live recording from the pair, as they explained to us earlier this month. &quot;We came up with those ideas more or less like with every other release we’ve made&quot; they begin when quizzed on their recent 'Argument #03' EP. &quot;We build a noise structure upon a series of rhythmic patterns, recording everything live. Our working process is usually divided in two phases: in the first we design the sounds, the beats and set the audio modules, the second phase is the actual performance and recording.&quot;</p>\n<p>The pair have had three releases to date, all out via Haunter and all tagged by the Argument series. Their quick workflow gives their tracks firebomb levels of intensity - each release is recorded in a single day to retain a consistent set of tonal qualities. The sound the duo have arrived at was not always the Cage Suburbia manifesto however.  &quot;We met a few years before the birth of Haunter and initially, our tracks were way more dub-oriented&quot; they begin. &quot;They were usually recorded with found hardware - but mostly with just one drum machine, one monophonic sound module and various pedals and amps. These now lead to our current set up made of broken drum machines, homemade wavetable synths, vintage samplers and various distortion and delay pedals.&quot;</p>\n<p>Their mix for us covers an unexpectedly diverse range of styles and moods, from clattering dub to acid-laced Eastern percussive experiments. As the duo explain, &quot;We did this mix using tracks that influence us and our individual ideas of sound, rather than those that influence the Cage Suburbia sound. It contains a lot of dub and a track from our friends Primitive Art, as well as some unreleased tracks from our solo projects. We're currently undergoing an On-U fixation and most of the stuff we're listening is dub, soundtracks and library records.&quot;</p>\n<p>No tracklist available.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?embed_type=widget_standard&amp;embed_uuid=fb5b0df7-beea-4175-aef2-41df0b63828a&amp;feed=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0055-cage-suburbia%2F&amp;hide_artwork=1&amp;hide_cover=1&amp;hide_tracklist=1&amp;mini=1&amp;replace=0\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"60\" width=\"100%\"></iframe><div style=\"clear: both; height: 3px; width: 562px;\"></div><p style=\"display: block; font-size: 11px; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; margin: 0px; padding: 3px 4px; color: rgb(153, 153, 153); width: 562px;\"><a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/0055-cage-suburbia/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=resource_link\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:#808080; font-weight:bold;\">0055 // Cage Suburbia</a><span> by </span><a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=profile_link\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:#808080; font-weight:bold;\">Stray Landings</a><span> on </span><a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=homepage_link\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:#808080; font-weight:bold;\"> Mixcloud</a></p><div style=\"clear: both; height: 3px; width: 562px;\"></div>",

    "content": "<p>I remember hearing Andrea Parker's work for the first time, picking up a copy of the 'Melodius Thunk' 12&quot; on impulse. It sounded like some dark-as-fuck alternative Goldeneye soundtrack, sweat drenched rhythms and feverish melodies shuddering between Parker's impenetrable blasts of crater-dwelling low-end. Delving deeper, I discovered her discography is rife with twisted electro gems - a genre with which I was had never expressed much interested in before. Listening to the earth-rumbing swagger of 'The Swamp' cemented her as an artist with whom I'd be dedicating a rather large amount of listening time to.</p>\n<p>Alongside her solo productions, Parker has worked extensively with Dave Morley and also finds the time to run two labels - Touchin' Bass and Aperture. While the former focuses on boundary-nudging dancefloor music, Aperture enjoys a far wider repertoire, releasing the wonderfully fractured collection of noise experiments, <em>No.3. Obliate</em>, by T.e.s.o recently for example.</p>\n<p>With an EP by Berlin based Dead Fader out on Touchin' Bass a number of months ago and an upcoming performance from Parker due at this year's Bloc festival, we decided to catch up with the Kent born artist to discuss her two labels, meeting the Director of the Daphne Oram Collection and watching Mark Bell cycle into a lake...</p>\n<p><strong>Hi Andrea, first off how are things? You're playing at this year's Bloc festival - have you been to previous editions? Anyone in particular you are looking forward to seeing play?</strong></p>\n<p>Alright, thanks. I’m a bit battered after drinking my own body weight in booze over Christmas and New Year, but apart from that all good.</p>\n<p>Funnily enough, I’m coming back to play at Bloc after headlining one of their first ever do’s in Brighton about twelve years ago. I’ve been to the odd few in between but more often than not I end up missing the main artist I’ve gone to see, usually due to the fact that I’ve been cleaning my chalet again! That said, I’ve seen some great artists there in the past. This year I’m looking forward to seeing Ugandan Methods featuring Regis &amp; Ancient Methods, Trade featuring Surgeon &amp; Blawan, Powell, Objekt, Evian Christ, Daniel Miller, Jeff Mills and a bit of Fast Eddie of course.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/19762742&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Touchin' Bass has been running since 2002, seeing nearly 50 releases. How do you think the label's ethos has changed over the years and how do you think it has staying the same?</strong></p>\n<p>The first release was in 2001 but yes, one more release to go before hitting 50. The ethos is pretty much the same really. It’s always been about a different take or outlook on electro. Electro meaning taking electronic music to its furthest extremes. I’ve always had a very resolute attitude and an uncompromising vision. The main ethos is to keep pushing forward-thinking, non-generic music.</p>\n<p><strong>You released an EP by Dead Fader most recently on the label - can you tell us about how you first came across John's work?</strong></p>\n<p>A superb EP it is, too. The Dosage EP. Very industrial and distorted. I first got into his work when I heard his EP ‘Work It, No’ on Fumihiko Records. It was a really heavy slab of industrial vinyl. I’m also really into Sensational, who he collaborated with on one of the tracks. I pretty much tore the arse out of it and played it in nearly all my sets. It still works really well today.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/122913868&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I read you used to play Cello, and worked as a session singer for some time as well. Do you still keep up with the Cello? Tell us about how you've incorporated strings/vocals into your music previously.</strong></p>\n<p>It is true that I started out at a session singer, singing over hardcore tracks but the less said about that the better! I’m actually just about to get a pickup installed in my Cello so I can distort the hell out of it! I love the sound of the Cello, it can sound so ominous and dark, yet so beautiful. Strings have always been a big part of my writing. I first worked with a 40 piece orchestra in 1996 when I recorded ‘The Rocking Chair’, now it seems like everyone is at it?! I used strings a lot on my earlier Mo Wax recordings. I don’t actually read music, I just fuck around until I hear what’s in my head. I usually have a very clear vision. It’s the same with vocals. I don’t class myself as a singer, I just try to use my voice as another instrument (with lashings of reverb!) although I do really love writing lyrics, it’s a great outlet.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1635/24093621771_becfa99b79_z.jpg\" alt=\"andrea\"></p>\n<p><strong>I’ve been listening to your album with Daz Quayle reinterpretting some of Daphne Oram's most notable releases - it's excellent! Do you remember the first time you heard her work? How did the project come about?</strong></p>\n<p>Thank you. I feel it’s our best work to date. It was an honour for me as she has always been an inspiration throughout my career and one of my idols. I first heard her work about 20 years ago, mainly through her work with the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. It used to infuriate me that she never got the credit she deserved but thankfully now her legacy is starting to be recognised, like with the installation of a replica of the Oramics machine at the Science Museum in London.</p>\n<p>To build something as pioneering and as unique as the Oramics machine to read waveforms drawn on 35mm film which triggered sounds as it was passed through a beam of light is the concept that paved the way for electronic music as we know it today; the earliest form of the electronic synthesiser! Truly amazing and a great slice of British engineering and mathematics, all built into the empty shell of her own dressing table! The story behind this album began when I was called into a meeting at The Royal Festival Hall who were putting together The Oramics Night - a night celebrating Daphne Oram and the Oramics machine. They were looking for an artist who could write and produce an original piece of music incorporating some of Daphne’s sounds and then perform the piece live. I couldn’t believe the opportunity I had been given. The defining moment for me was when I was given access to Daphne’s numerous recordings and sounds. These sounds, like Daphne's Oramics machine itself, are a part of British musical history. Where America had Bob Moog, Britain had Daphne Oram. Daz and I used literally hundreds of samples and all 100 channels of our mixer for this one piece. We knew we couldn’t stop there! We felt like we had only scratched the surface and wanted to dig deeper into the life and works of Daphne Oram to create an entire album, to unfold the story even more.</p>\n<p>We wanted the chance to re-work, re-interpret and manipulate these sounds to create a unique concept album. I arranged to meet with Dr. Mick Grierson, Director of the Daphne Oram Collection at Goldsmiths College and Secretary of the Daphne Oram Trust and, after hearing the idea, he thankfully agreed. We spent hundreds of hours sampling these sounds and treating them through various noise reduction processors, trying to strike the balance between making them audible in the mix without losing the individual characteristics of the original sounds. We wanted to use some of the less-obvious, unnerving sounds we found in the archives to explore a different side of Daphne Oram, a darker side, incorporating them alongside sounds from my own archives (made using analogue synthesisers like my beloved Arp2600!).

Any particular artists we should check out?</strong></p>\n<p>It was mainly to do with my love for, and fascination with the 808 boooooooooom! I also grew up watching breakdancing on lino in the shopping precinct on Saturdays where I got to hear a lot of electro. Electro to me was always a bit out there, futuristic. What I loved is that it kept developing, changing forms and moving forward. You had artists like Kraftwerk, Newcleus, Hashim, Man Parrish, Jonzun Crew in the beginning, then the next generation of artists like Drexciya, Model 500, Dopplereffekt, Electronome, IL.EK.tro and Ben Milstein moved it forward, with labels like SCSI-AV, Outside, Panic Trax and Touchin’ Bass releasing the more futuristic and experimental side of electro, pushing the boundaries. For me, artists like Einoma and Bitstream got it to where it needed to be, but now it’s all about Fastgraph and Ultradyne.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/19306854&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>What music were you into when you were growing up in Kent?</strong></p>\n<p>All sorts. I certainly went through a lot of phases. The Specials, KRS ONE, Bauhaus, Ryuichi Sakamoto, This Mortal Coil, Joy Division, The Ultra Magnetic MC’s, Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Flying Lizards, Japan, The Human League, The Smiths, Public Enemy, The Fall, Coil, Throbbing Gristle… then it all went  mental, with me driving round motorways trying to find illegal raves….  aciiiiiiiiiid!</p>\n<p><strong>I was reading in a comment on Discogs that you played at a '10 years of R&amp;S event' in 1994 alongside David Morley in Ghent, attended by the likes of CJ Bolland, Derrick May and Carl Craig just to name a few. Do you remember the occasion? What was it like having so many notable producers in one place?</strong></p>\n<p>That is a gig I will never forget. It was a stellar line up and quite intimidating to be amongst so many people that I was already into and really admired. It was called ’10 Days of Techno’ and that’s exactly what it was! I have to mention LFO, because my biggest memory of that gig was Mark Bell cycling into the lake… don’t ask?! Seriously, David and I played live. From what I can remember we had David’s Fairlight with discs the size of a 12” (one of which I dropped down the back of the stage!), an Arp which he had to turn on with a key and always performed differently in different temperatures, an R8 drum machine, a turntable, SFX... I can’t really remember the rest. But the amazing thing about that gig was that we only had a few days to get it all together and that’s how Two Sandwiches Short of a Lunchbox was formed. Renaat Vandepapeliere then released it as an EP immediately afterwards on Apollo, a subsidiary of R&amp;S Records.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/19761548&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>How did you first meet David Morley?</strong></p>\n<p>It was Renaat who actually hooked me up with David. I was DJing at Lost in about 1993 and I played one of David’s records in my set. Renaat introduced himself to me and I mentioned that I loved David’s work and analogue synths, then to cut a long story short, the next thing I knew I was standing on his doorstep in Belgium! I walked into his studio and I was like a kid in a sweet shop. It was ridiculous. It was like an analogue museum. We had a chat about music, then decided to experiment and go for it…</p>\n<p><strong>Finally what's next for yourself? What can we expect to see next on Touchin' Bass/Aperture?</strong></p>\n<p>Next year will be an exciting one. I’m 45 and I’m going to Dungeness to see power stations in the desert... It’s the 50th release on Touchin’ Bass, the 10th release on Aperture and I will also be releasing some more collaborations with Daz Quayle. Hopefully I will finish my album… if I can stop having accidents and injuring myself! Other than that I’m hoping to visit my adopted polar bear in Svalbard and get some more honey from my bee hive in Shropshire.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/161050362&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Featuring such artists as Ryuichi Sakamoto and Marsen Jules, 12k have released covered wide ground across over 100 records. Yet despite the longevity of the project, 12k never seem to run out of steam. To the contrary, records such as Taylor Deupree and Marcus Fischer's <em>Twine</em> sound as fresh and challenging as anything from their near 20 year existence. As part of our 'In Focus' series, looking at some of our favorite labels, we got the chance to speak to label head Taylor Deupree about the ethos and foundations of 12k.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/182874546&color=959391&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>“There was a fairly decisive point that started the ball rolling”, he begins. “In 1996 I had a contract for an album with Silent Records in California who never fulfilled their end of the deal and didn’t release the album. Taking a look at the landscape of labels at the time I was frustrated at the lack of artist-run labels that really focused on the quality of the whole experience rather than on trends. I was working at a label at the time as well (Instinct Records, as their art director) so I had some knowledge of the basics of how to run, and not to run, a label. So really it all fell into place then and I decided to release the CD that was supposed to come out on Silent by myself.. and 12k was born. I often think of what my career would look like today if Silent <em>had</em> released that album and 12k was never started. Funny how these little moments, circumstances, snap-decisions, can really change the course of your entire life. Fascinating. As frustrated as I was with labels and the whole music business at that time, it was a blessing in disguise. I wanted to do a label right, at least my vision of what was “right.” For better or worse, I wanted to take the whole process into my own hands.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1653/23670085773_4aebddc4c4_b.jpg\" alt=\"studio1\">\n<em>The 12k studio.</em></p>\n<p>Despite an expansive base of releases, 12k are also known for their precise aesthetic. On their website, the style is described as “a precisely-outlined, yet deeply emotional concoction of the technological and the organic.” This makes sense in the context of the electro-acoustic genre, of which 12k are champions. “12k’s music has always revolved around technology”, Deupree explains. “Whether it was early experiments in post-techno or microsound to current hybrids of electronic and acoustic music. Technology has always been centre stage and many of our artists rely on it to do what they do. I’ve always been attracted to and wanted to be an artist, but am not a very good one unless I have technology to help me along…</p>\n<p>&quot;So, because of this, technology always played a role in my life and supporting role in my creative endeavours. Fast forward to more recent years and I begin to feel that technology has taken over our lives too much, thus my desire to start down-playing the technological in my work. Combine this with my life-long love of nature and landscapes and the two become this hybrid of the technologic and organic. The organic provides a humanness, a roughness, and imperfection to the technology, and the technology brings the natural out of context and helps redefine it.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1687/24001304440_3145a1fd29_b.jpg\" alt=\"studio\"></p>\n<p>On their website, you can find a list 12 principles upon which the label was founded. These could be read as an almost Biblical list of commandments, yet the label could never be described as dogmatic. The last of the 12 is “everything will change”, which Deupree describes as the “most important of all”. Deupree clarifies; “while I do feel there is a strong mission behind 12k it’s also important to realise that nothing is sacred, that everything will change, and that there’s no point in trying to guess the future. You have to realise that your ideas are fluid, that just because something is interesting and important to you now it doesn’t mean it will be ten years from now.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps most intriguing of the 12 principles is number 8: “Never try to innovate”. It can often seem as if this is the precise opposite of what musicians are regularly told to do. Innovation, we are told, is the foundation of creativity. But Deupree's sentiments are more expressionist than futurist in this regard. “Innovation is the wrong motivation for musicians. If innovation is your prime motivation, you will be more concerned about public reception (after all, it is the public who will ultimately determine whether you have “innovated” or not) than you will be of self-expression. Self-expression should be an artist’s primary reason for creating art. Be true to yourself and create something personal. Innovation may happen, or it may not. Innovation should be a happy byproduct, not a motivator.”</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/80802534&color=999695&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>Although their music is worlds apart, the resistance to innovation is reminiscent of the ethos of Terre Thaemlitz aka DJ Sprinkles. For Thaemlitz, originality is inextricably linked to individuality and privatisation of one’s creative labour. According to Thaemlitz, we should rather be aiming to reference pre-existing historical material, and hence highlight that which is common amongst us. However, Deupree’s thoughts differ in their conclusions about this. “It’s not good to be stuck in the past” he continues. “Certainly these references can’t help but pop up, and for sure paying respect to those who came before us is valid and important, but to do nothing but redo what has already been done isn’t going down the right path either.</p>\n<p>&quot;I don’t believe that early pioneers of electronic music, or any form of music, sat down to their instrument and said “OK, today I am going to innovate!” More realistically they came across a new tool that may or may not have been intended for music and set out to explore its possibilities. They were driven by exploration not innovation. “Innovation” to me sounds like you are looking for some reward, trying to impress an audience. It’s not genuine. Explore and you may end up innovating and it comes as an accidental bonus and certainly your explorations would deserve some form of praise, but don’t let that praise be your primary motivating factor.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1688/23668784924_1603e6ae7e_b.jpg\" alt=\"books\"></p>\n<p>12k furthermore describe themselves as “anti-design”, another term which designates the label as an antithesis to much of the prevailing music industry norms. “When I talk about “anti-design” I’m talking about a graphic representation in as pure a form as possible”, Deupree writes. “Graphic design is about communication, and I feel the most successful design gets its point across the most directly, while retaining a sense of aesthetics and taste. I don’t think anyone can claim that 12k’s design is full of drama, decoration or excess fluff. So many design trends have come and gone that utilise certain flares that pin it to a particular style or time. While this can often be impossible to avoid, I try to avoid these types of traps with 12k (whether I’m successful or not is another story). Simple typography over unadorned backgrounds and photography/images that conveys a message to the buyer and listener… this is as pure as I’ve been able to boil down the design aesthetic to convey what needs to be conveyed. I don’t feel that any of these beliefs hinder me from making this “symbiotic” connection between the music and the artwork. In fact, I feel it strengthens it. There is no excess decoration or distraction to get in the way.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1623/23668784384_773bbd51e3_b.jpg\" alt=\"forest\">\n<em>View from the 12k studio.</em></p>\n<p>The latest release on the label was <em>Twine</em>, a collaboration LP between Deupree himself and Marcus Fischer. The album uses magnetic tape loops as its primary focus, creating an eery and solitary sound. “After doing some initial experiments and recordings we decided that we wanted to push ourselves somewhere differently, not to just settle on the previous methods” Deupree says. “We started exploring recordings on Marcus’ reel-to-reel tape machines and during a tired late night, a loop on one was just playing in the background as we hung out and talked. The sound of this lone, mono loop really intrigued us and we knew we had something to go on. One strong characteristic of <em>Twine</em> is that it all came together very quickly, we had the album recorded in two or three days. This has happened in the past in some of my projects, and I always feel like the best work is sometimes the work that gets completed very quickly, almost in a stream of inspiration. Work that is laboured over for months can often be refined very nicely but also risks being stressed over too much, or over-refined. There is a spontaneous and natural quality to <em>Twine</em> that draws on the energy of not being over-thought. These times when the music just flows, without too much thought or stress can be when the most magic happens.”</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/141666937?color=e1e8eb&portrait=0\" width=\"570\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>The experiments with format do not seem to ending anytime soon either. “I’ve been working on a new solo album for about a year, the follow up to my last, <em>Faint</em>” Deupree tells me. “It’s being created using a very specific means of production with a pretty limited palette of instruments. Mostly electric piano and glockenspiel, with a little DX-7 and some other synths thrown in.”</p>\n<p>This is what makes 12k a success. It’s a label that has coupled a continued openness to exploration with years of establishing its structural and ideological foundations. As a result, an album of such scope as <em>Twine</em> can be written in just a few days. At it’s core, 12k seem to make a minimalist expression that is ultimately at odds with the hyperactive bustle and information-saturation afforded by the modern world. Deupree expands; “my interest in minimalism definitely spawned from living in New York City and desiring a more calmed and focused lifestyle. It played out (and still does) in my music, design, home life and general aesthetics of living. It’s so easy to get caught up in the over-saturation. Personally, I feel minimalism is more important than ever, but I’m not sure many share the same belief as the desire for more and louder constantly prevails. It can be difficult to try to sell quiet, beatless music. It certainly doesn’t get the attention that loud music does. Volume sells.” Yet Deupree remains resilient: “but, what can I do? Hopefully open the ears of a few listeners and offer them a bit of respite from our overloaded society.”</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/184844848&color=95908d&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>All photos by Taylor Deupree.</p>\n",

The title is also the name with which West Midlands-raised artist Steve Bailey takes as his production alias.

    "content": "<p>I’ve come to learn that a new release on Testtoon Records is always something to get excited about. Following a flurry of outstanding albums from the enigmatic <a href=\"http://www.straylandings.co.uk/podcasts/102396176428\">Oubys</a>, last year we were also treated to Michael Fahres’ <a href=\"http://www.straylandings.co.uk/reviews/michael-fahres-tibataje\"><em>Tibataje</em> LP</a>. It can be hard to weave a narrative through all that the label releases. <em>Tibataje</em> was an oddball sound experiment exploring the natural echo of a mountainside on the Canary Islands. Oubys by contrast is best known for his bedroom synth noodling. Testtoon's sound is at times aggressive, at others it can be pious and sorrowful. Still, despite vast disparity between every release, there is an odd glue that seems to hold it all together. This is especially true in 2016, which sees Testtoon with their most cohesive record yet.</p>\n<p>The Sova Stroj project is Michel Flammant's first venture away from playing in a collective. Improvisation and chance are integral to his recording and playing style, and it comes through loud and clear on Silent Earth. It’s hardly surprising that Flammant has a history in playing black metal. There are points on <em>Silent Earth</em> that feel like a Krautrock band covering Sunn O))). Deep and moody drones stretch out over four long meditations, sinking the listener into a deep trance.</p>\n<p>But <em>Silent Earth</em> is far from gloomy. To the contrary, there are points, like the album’s second piece, ‘As Days Grow Silent We Love Each Other’, that come through clean and distinct. Here, Flammant plays with the resonant frequencies of what sounds like an accordion. We are not in black metal territory anymore. But where we are is also uncertain. Flammant’s emphasis on live playing is crucial. You can almost hear him tracing the contours of every tone, steadily bending each note out of shape. By the albums close, there is nothing but harsh static and the dull hum of wind.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/236220271&color=999897&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>The title of the latest release from Antye Greie-Ripatti, better known as AGF, represents a decidedly Internet-age equation - '&gt;if*true~time[x]1+2=you.&lt; '. The codified title is typical of Greie-Ripatti's work. When one of our writers went to see her at Cafe OTO last year, the audience were treated to an extended section of her rapping in code. So too are the intricate melodies and sharp digital extremeties which circle Greie-Ripatti's abstract beat-poems.</p>\n<p>However, opener and title track, '&gt;if*true~time[x]1+2=you.&lt; ', explores more hardened textures than I've become used to from Greie-Ripatti. She works screwfaced kick drums and makeshift steel hats into adrenaline charged patterns that are almost reminiscent of grime. 'greim x93' picks up neatly from this trajectory, with ruptured low-end shuddering between a spiders-web of hisses, clicks and buzzes. Left void of Greie-Ripatti's vocal play, the track's delicate sound-design and masterful use of foley is given full spotlight.</p>\n<p>One of the most interesting things about the release is the way in which Greie-Ripatti draws together all the elements in the closing track, presenting the equation in full with 'time-ish'. The repeated 'you, you you' and 'time, time, time' motif's of the opening two tracks collide between thudding percussion, climaxing in an intricate cacophany of harmonies, before easing away in a bed of prickling static loops once again.</p>\n<p>Given the complexity of this cohesion, I can't help but be left wondering what to expect from <em>KON:3p&gt;utionTO:e[VOL]ution</em> - the AGF album due later this year which which this release previews. Interviewing Greie-Ripatti last year, we were left dumbfounded at the range and complexity of the projects she was undertaking after closing the interview with a simple 'so what's next for yourself?' No doubt the forthcoming LP will leave us equally struck by the wealth of ideas.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1540669210/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://agf-poemproducer.bandcamp.com/album/if-true-time-x-1-2-you\">>if*true~time[x]1+2=you.\\< by AGF</a></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>With only one release prior, you'll be hard pressed to find much out about the Konstrukt imprint. Their debut release came from another unknown entity, SHLTR, however 'Kor' features two slightly better known production outfits, Cassegrain and Sendai. For those unfamiliar, the former is a matching of Alex Tsiridis and Hüseyin Evirgren while the latter a collaboration between Archives Intérieures founders, Yves De Mey &amp; Peter Van Hoesen.</p>\n<p>Both projects stayed relatively quiet over 2015. Sendai appeared to take a small hiatus since their wonderfully fractured full-length, <em>A Smaller Divide</em> (bar a contribution to a Stroboscopic Artefacts compilation), a perhaps unsurprising fact given that Yves de Mey's debut solo album now see's itself on the brink of release too. Cassegrain on the other hand released only the 'Window Window' EP alongside regular production partner Johannes Auvinen aka Tin Man, having put out a wealth of releases (including their own LP) in the year prior.</p>\n<p>For 'Kor', Cassegrain and Sendai are given respective A and B sides of the release. Their approaches are well attuned to one another however, without losing the feeling of being different sides of the coin. Cassegrain's title track 'Kor' snarls forward, full of drive and intent. It's gritten synthwork grows to a steady climax, clamorous rhythms meshing together in tight formation. Following this 'Katran' warbles and squelches along, scratching percussive flourishes neatly filling in the blanks between the throb of 4/4 kicks.</p>\n<p>Sendai's opening offering on the other hand, 'Antennaed', feels like a baggage conveyor with its rubber belt slashed - spilling off luggage haphazardly. The effect calls to mind <em>Confield</em> era Autechre, phone-line synthesis working into a dizzying mess between Sendai's staggered rhythms. Their second offering, 'Other_Etcs' on the other hand explores hollowed out Anstam-style rhythmic experiments, ruptured melodies making darting appearances intermittently, only to be buried again by Sendai's crushing kicks and snares.</p>\n<p>Pairing two acts at such a similar stage of development appears to have been a wise move for Konstrukt, despite only being in its infancy as a label. The first release proved its founders have a keen ear for up-and-coming talent, where as the second shows they are equally capable of championing established acts. I have strong hopes for the third.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/238777268&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p>Last year I settled into one of Rabih Beaini’s shows in the small dark confines of Cafe OTO. The impression of that night still lingers. His formidable figure seamlessly melding the sounds of his Middle Eastern roots into jazz before crashing into militant techno. A child of Lebanon’s civil war, his music is permeated with social conflict, traditional heritage and experimental structures, so when CTM announced their theme of 'New Geographies' it came as little surprise that Beaini was going to be taken on board as co-curator. As a musician that dwells in the dynamics of regional identity and cosmopolitan space, he represents everything the theme makes us question: “the hereto accepted notions of culture, identity, and community”. With the festival looming, we caught up with Beaini on reciprocating culture, early music experiences and achieving freedom through music.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/93414972&color=999897&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>So let’s start with CTM’s theme, New Geographies, did you help select that or were you picked up because it matched your ideas?</strong></p>\n<p>They chose me because of my heritage and my contribution to the musical scene. We’ve done some collaborations before — I think that was something that inspired them to work with me more. It’s a crucial theme in my music work. I think CTM wanted to take the angle of communications (like global communications) in music and then the whole theme and ideas came and developed after that. The main focus is how things communicate from one place to another in the world, and how the transformation of many traditional practices are interpreted today and projected into the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you find there’s often a balancing of global and traditional in your own work?</strong></p>\n<p>I think it’s quite an unconscious thing, I don’t think about it much. It develops after a lot of years working on music and getting a lot of influences, and also developing a process of public and a process for private. An approach to how much should be played and used, I think t's a combining of the two things, so the knowledge — my personal knowledge — and this process development, but in a non calculated way.</p>\n<p><strong>In  <em>For The Right Red Hand</em>, there’s some strong social messages and tension coming through, were you thinking of anything in particular?</strong></p>\n<p>It was exactly that kind of focus; the internal conflict of every person that questions themselves and what is surrounding them: the sociopolitical. There’s so many of us that don’t know what is right and wrong. The line is becoming too fine right now, but also the standard is becoming much more secure in a way so... it’s kind of a representation of this conflict in a good and a bad way.</p>\n<p><strong>Growing up during a civil war, what was your musical environment like?</strong></p>\n<p>Well besides the local music from, let’s say 80’s psychedelic rock and popular music, there was a point where traditional music came back to the music scene in Lebanon, and I really like this combination between the two things. Since I was a child, I was exposed to very traditional, very regional music, music from the surrounding areas, very specific and localised music. But at the same time, I grew up in school and we had cassettes arriving from outside, friends that are dubbing cassettes and passing them in the classroom. I got exposed to a lot of early hip hop, early house, early electronic music, not really knowing the background, definitions and such, but developing that knowledge in the later years. Moving to Italy, it was more about experimental jazz and the avant garde.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1473/24423389191_959eea6d0d_b.jpg\" alt=\"live\"></p>\n<p><strong>What made you go into music when you were younger?</strong></p>\n<p>I don’t know, I really, really don’t know. It just fell on me in a way. I mean, I have no musical background with family but maybe it was the sense of freedom that was driving me there. The sense of creativity within something that is actually nice and useful. Recreation is a right to every person. Even making silly dance music is a right for the society. I can’t really tell why, I just think it was natural.</p>\n<p><strong>Was it this sense of freedom that attracted you to improvised music?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s somehow related to freedom and not applying to musical rules and things that can tie you down to a certain theme or structure. At the same time, it is tightly related to structure in a way. My kind of improvised music is developed following a scheme that I’ve studied and learnt from before, so it’s not really random or completely freeform. In my opinion, freedom is something you need to earn, by knowing what to do with the freedom that you get.</p>\n<p><strong>Did you find music helped you communicate or settle in Italy?</strong></p>\n<p>Um, I think, in a very narrow way yes. Like, the very first person I met there was also a DJ so it was quite a clear reference to start talking about and sharing music. The language developed in the later months. I started learning the language when I moved there, but I think the communication reached a higher level when I started playing in more places and meeting more people. The medium of music introduced me to a lot of real special persons. It all grows together in a way, you share and things grow. I’m still friends with them now.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/84977482&color=999999&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Were there ever any hostilities or difficulties for you?</strong></p>\n<p>Besides some episodes, especially in the following years, I think the excitement of discovering Italy and of living in a new place, and the resemblance or familiarity of my own culture with the Italian culture, meant that I never really felt detached. I never really felt like a complete foreigner, or that I didn’t fit. Italians are welcoming people and fun to be with so it was a good experience, there weren’t difficulties at the start. There were things you couldn’t avoid, you have them everywhere. 9/11 was quite a crucial point, I think for every foreigner that was living abroad, from immigrants, to students to workers, I think it was a crucial point, but hopefully we’re going to go beyond that.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you see a strong correlation between how you think of society and how you think of your music?</strong></p>\n<p>Absolutely, you cannot deny it. Sometimes musicians try not to be too political but I think already in the early stages in choosing what to listen to and what to develop in your career, it’s already a political choice. You can’t escape it in a way. Probably not through clear statements, but yes, the sociopolitical is related to my music.</p>\n<p><strong>CTM has a lot of artists this year making social or political comments, like Disarm. Is there anything in particular you’re excited to have on the programme?</strong></p>\n<p>The Disarm project is actually a very powerful message. I was really happy we were able to accomplish that, it was quite a tricky one to get confirmed. I’m really happy to have got Pauline Oliveros. A crucial and essential figure in my, and a lot of people's, musical life. Abdel Karim Shaar is a very, very respected tarab singer in Lebanon. He is very famous there, not really well known in the mainstream but an important figure in Lebanon. He also used to sing in a choir in church, so he had all these influences in and beyond Lebanon and developed his own way of singing tarab. This applied perfectly to the theme in my opinion, but also it was a way of introducing something that I grew up with into where I am living now. I wanted to share this with CTM and everybody.\nThen there’s Sharif Sehnaoui, a musician also from Lebanon doing a commissioned piece. One Man Nation from Singapore. Also because she is a very active person on gender and transgender rights and she has her very own way of performing and it a very beautiful way.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/78782467?color=ffffff&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"570\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>Which artists do you wish you had been able to book for the festival?</strong></p>\n<p>Last year I discovered a gamelan master from Bali who completely rewrote the scales of the gamelan and retuned it and made an album that I would consider avant garde and free jazz, made out of a gamble ensemble. I think it’s really mind blowing but it’s quite impossible to bring him over for one show in Europe. A whole orchestra, all the gamelan, very huge and heavy. It should be managed in a much better way, perhaps in a future project. Many particular traditional rituals, very transformative rituals from Indonesia would also be completely displaced and out of place if brought to Berlin, in my opinion. Sometimes, maybe, things should stay where they are. If there is a will to bring them out, they will express that will. I think we respected that.</p>\n<p><strong>CTM is balanced between audio and visual, that’s not really something you’ve worked on before.</strong></p>\n<p>I think CTM is one of the festivals that is mostly balanced on that side. Unlike many other festivals, they don’t appoint too much to the visual side where you are sometimes distracted from what’s actually happening, or the transformative, introversial message that the music is giving you. You really don’t transcend because you are looking around you, or in front, to a video or video art. CTM is well balanced though, they’ve worked on many installations and dance performances but not too much. The installation by Vincent Moon is absolutely crucial to this year’s theme. The project is called Híbridos and it’s about a very specific community in the Amazon in Brazil. He is representing the ethnomusicological but without wanting to; he’s not going on an expedition, he’s travelling and incorporating the cultures. He’s not only taking but also giving, I think it’s one of the best examples of how music research should be done and he’s got some extremely beautiful images. He’s an artist himself so I think this is what he gives; his art. This video art installation will be played on three screens, mixing together films he’s made. It’s very interesting and he’ll be presenting a new project on opening night.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1585/24397472432_456a80997d_b.jpg\" alt=\"Híbridos\">\n<em>Híbridos</em></p>\n<p><strong>Is reciprocation and exchange important with music? I have the image of Western popular music being exported but not so much being brought back.</strong></p>\n<p>It’s absolutely the contrary in my opinion. Western music is almost entirely based on what came from the rest of the world initially, because if you strip it down it would become, probably not even medieval music, like classical music that has developed from that. But still, it’s a transformation that happened in the Western world that is now going back and influencing all these parts of the world where they originated. In the same way that African music went to America and became Jazz and Blues, then Jazz, Blues and Funk came back to Africa and created Afro Beat. It’s a whole loop that’s continuous. I think, New Geographies explores how Western music influenced traditional music around the world, in the present. In the contemporary era. But also, while that music is being transformed, it’s being transmitted to us here.</p>\n<p>The freshness of this phenomenon, especially in the last couple of years, is that there are genres which are being born and created in the remotest of areas but becoming influential or central in modern, Western music. We are going beyond the etiquette of World Music where there is a presentation of a traditional band, or a really important traditional singer, it goes beyond that, breaking the rules and coming into the Western world proving that it’s something really stable and really important and that’s what is happening with music in South East Asia or the Middle East, in Egypt, North Africa, and sometimes South America in a way. The transformation of their own music into electronic beats and how that influences house and techno. There’s so much around. So much that we don’t know about, or that is hidden, or not really widely known, and the world is so big, we don’t even have an idea about how big the world is. It’s fascinating.</p>\n<p><em>Berlin’s CTM festival will begin January 29th.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?embed_type=widget_standard&embed_uuid=b90b9a30-c283-411a-a17a-b0523cbe498c&feed=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2FElectronicBunker%2Fra460-rabih-beaini%2F&hide_cover=1&hide_tracklist=1&replace=0\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><div style=\"clear: both; height: 3px; width: auto;\"></div><p style=\"display: block; font-size: 11px; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px; padding: 3px 4px; color: rgb(153, 153, 153); width: auto;\"><a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/ElectronicBunker/ra460-rabih-beaini/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=base_links&utm_term=resource_link\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:#808080; font-weight:bold;\">RA.460 Rabih Beaini</a><span> by </span><a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/ElectronicBunker/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=base_links&utm_term=profile_link\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:#808080; font-weight:bold;\">Electronicbunker</a><span> on </span><a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=base_links&utm_term=homepage_link\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:#808080; font-weight:bold;\"> Mixcloud</a></p><div style=\"clear: both; height: 3px; width: auto;\"></div>",

    "content": "<p>Hailing from Iran, Porya Hatami is best known for his sepia-toned and wistful soundscapes. He describes his sound as “explor[ing] the balance between electronics and environmental sounds, utilizing processed acoustic and electronic sources and field recordings.” Following an e-mail exchange about his latest album, we caught up Hatami and he agreed to record a mix for us, which features as the 57th instalment of our podcast series. I first became aware of Hatami’s music through a personal recommendation from Martin J Thompson, label head of <a href=\"https://sm-ll.bandcamp.com\">SM-LL</a> and web designer of Stray Landings. “I became interested in [Thompson]’s music through his &quot;sound a day&quot; blog which he was doing back in 2012”, he explains. “I think it would be great if we can do something together someday, I really love his work, he is a super talented artist”. Thompson furthermore designed the artwork for an album that came out earlier in 2015, <a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/reviews/in-between-spaces\"><em>In-Between Spaces</em></a>. Here, Hatami worked in collaboration with Darren McClure, who happens to live on the other side of the world in Matsumoto, Japan. This was a record of staggering subtlety. Harmonic loops ebb and flow around the mix, and slowly envelop the listener in its waves.</p>\n<p>Collaboration seems crucial to Hatami. In 2015, we saw the second of Hatami’s remix albums, this time including contributions from Loscil and Segue. “I tried to slow things down a bit last year and focus more on collaborating with other artists and experimenting with new sounds,” he expands. This year too, we will be treated to several collaborative projects. “I have two albums ready at the moment, one is the three-way collaboration with Arovane and Darren McClure which will be released in a few months, the other one is the album with Slavek Kwi aka Artificial Memory Trace, and I'm also working on a collaboration with Tomotsugu Nakamura”, he continues. The mix Hatami has done showcases his ability to create and sustain atmosphere. There are drones, microtones and the sound of heavy wind. Highly recommended for solitary listening.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?embed_type=widget_standard&embed_uuid=edec87f8-044c-4263-bab4-959481ebf145&feed=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0057%2F&hide_tracklist=1&replace=0\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><div style=\"clear: both; height: 3px; width: auto;\"></div><p style=\"display: block; font-size: 11px; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px; padding: 3px 4px; color: rgb(153, 153, 153); width: auto;\"><a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/0057/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=base_links&utm_term=resource_link\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:#808080; font-weight:bold;\">0057</a><span> by </span><a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/straylandings/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=base_links&utm_term=profile_link\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:#808080; font-weight:bold;\">Stray Landings</a><span> on </span><a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=base_links&utm_term=homepage_link\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:#808080; font-weight:bold;\"> Mixcloud</a></p><div style=\"clear: both; height: 3px; width: auto;\"></div>\n",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Camille Blake.</em></p>\n<p>Some may be surprised to hear that this is the debut release from SØS Gunver Ryberg. With performances at Boiler Room, Berlin Atonal, and even a cassette with Cristian Vogel, one would be forgiven for thinking she had already produced an entire library of music. But not so. The nascent Contort imprint, headed by Hayley and Samuel Kerridge, feature as the springboard for Ryberg’s inevitable rise to prominence. The 12” — entitled 'AFTRYK' — is an inspired 4-track trip, and the strongest from the label yet.</p>\n<p>Ryberg’s sound aims at a midground somewhere between 4am German techno and mind-bending sonic experimentation. She hits her target every time. Take the opening of ‘Skolezit’; it sounds as if we are entering into archetypal ‘sound art’ territory. Scratching high-end and lurking drones drenched in reverb were clearly written with Berlin’s power stations in mind. Yet without much hesitation, Ryberg plunges the listener into an aggressive shuddering pace. There is an unmistakable ‘live element’ to Ryberg’s music. One can even picture a circle of Ryberg clones, each pounding at their own floor tom. But by the end, they have all skulked out of sight, leaving us with nothing but tinnitus in our ears. ‘Pantodont’ follows suit. With such an unrelenting momentum, it becomes harder to keep up with the track as it progresses. Every bar seems to shift pattern with such subtlety that finding a pulse to move along to becomes hopeless. Instead, there is nothing to do but gape at the wonderous intracies of rhythm.</p>\n<p>But yet, it’s ‘1170 Siva (Bare Bones)’ that really makes this EP special. Comprised of clattering percussion, the rapidity of each individual hit is hard to take without tensing up. You can hear the clack of the drum machine pushed to its absolute limit, and you can almost imagine smoke bellowing out from its inner electrical workings as it goes into overdrive. The intensity is like staring into a strobe light, each signal coming through in brazen intervals. There is also what appears to be something of a sister track, ‘1170 Siva’, that closes the EP. Here, Ryberg is giving us full disclosure of her process of writing. Clearly, either track on the B-side could have been the final product, but Ryberg boldly puts both together, and it works.</p>\n<p>There are clear nods on this EP to the likes of Raster-Noton (Ueno Masaaki’s 'Vortices' EP comes particularly to mind). But it just wouldn’t fit as a Noton release. The sheer dank and murky sound is just too far a cry from the pristine cleanness that the label promotes. Contort’s history of leftfield techno parties and an even more leftfield set of releases make it a perfect home for the new producer. Contort, Ryberg and this EP feel completely alive with energy.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/175795912&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Taotzu Chang.</em></p>\n<p>Reloc — a duo project between Lucia H Chung a.k.a en creux and SM-LL label boss Martin J Thompson — take their name from a key on an old electronic typewriter. Short for ‘relocation’, to ‘reloc’ is to move to the end of the line you are writing. This is apt for two reasons. Firstly, it demonstrates their distinctly modern perspective, always pushing to be at the forefront of stylistic progress. It also infused the EP with themes of travel and transportation. The EP begins with a field recording of that strange fuzz that Berlin U-Bahns have as they pull out of the <em>Bahnsteig</em>. The references continue throughout, with allusions made to routes; ’W⇌H’, as well as timetables on ‘Fahrplan’. SM-LL releases have never had ‘proper’ names before, so this ought not be taken lightly, and nor should the name ‘Reloc’.</p>\n<p>SM-LL themselves are perhaps best known for their stark minimalism. Well… it doesn’t get much starker than this. The opener, ‘Line U8’, begins with a fizzy hiss over a plodding kick, and doesn’t move much beyond that. The self restraint in making something so confined is genuinely impressive. There is a peculiar similarity to the Detroit producers like Kyle Hall and Robert Hood. Not only in the minimalist futurism of the project and the label at large, but also in its <em>groove</em>. Despite its conceptual motivations, one can’t help but imagine how it would sound on a dance floor (pretty good I reckon). The ‘Batch series’ is also a fascinating idea in itself. Each limited to less than 20 presses, every instalment of the series has been cut to a transparent lathe.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1615/24680009556_052edd57a2_b.jpg\" alt=\"cut\">\n<em>Photo by Elliot Jay Stocks</em></p>\n<p>A concept EP about the sound of Berlin’s U-Bahn shouldn’t really work. Thompson explained that the EP has been “directly inspired by the sound of the Metro U8 line while [they] were in Berlin and [their] general love of traveling on the underground”. Indeed, there appears to be something quite natural and emblematic about the topic of travel in relation to SM-LL. Through an obvious influence from Krautrock, the tradition of cherishing the repetition of transport lives on. Where Kraftwerk took their inspiration from the Autobahn, the Trans Europe Express and the Tour de France, Reloc find joy in the network of nodes and paths that form Berlin’s U-Bahn.</p>\n<p>There is perhaps something more conceptual at work here too. Every track on this EP begins with an idea or a hook that is immediately presented. This is then slowly transformed into a mangled version of the opening premise, often completely out of recognition. It’s as if they have transported the listener and the music from A to B. Even SM-LL’s website looks as though it has been colour-coded to match the lines of an underground train map. This release is not for those who distract easily, but the trick is: just be patient and allow it to carry you along on its journey.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1547399948/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://sm-ll.bandcamp.com/album/reloc-batch-0002\">Reloc - Batch 0002 by Reloc</a></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>I used to work at a bookshop, mainly stationed in the philosophy section. There was one book which some charitable bookseller had agreed to stock from a regular face around the store. The book in question was comprised of nothing but symbols aside from the first few pages. “This is your captain speaking. You are now aboard flight 6666666666666……” it opened boldly, although the sixes extended right to the bottom of the page and overleaf. If I were to try and suggest some listening material to accompany this rather bewildering read, ‘Paradise’, the latest release in the Clandestine Compositions label might reasonably be worthy of a mention.</p>\n<p>Ligature is the moniker of Chris Hansell. This cassette pits resonant keys, gag-mouthed vocals and fighter-jet drones against one another between thick layers of static. Looking back over Hansell’s discography however, it's perhaps unsurprising this latest cassette takes its cues from some rather niche sub-genres. He has had a long history of playing in punk, hardcore and noise bands in his hometown - Brooklyn, New York.</p>\n<p>Here, these elements work together into an industrial barrage. Take the shards of distortion or paranoia laced synth-work through opener ‘Window To The World’. They would sit comfortably on a Merzbow record (or as comfortably as anything sits on a Merzbow record), while the crushing, over-amped drones of ‘Paradise I’ feel like we are seeing a guest appearance from Sunn O))).</p>\n<p>On the b-side, we are given some respite after this chaotic onslaught, however the tranquility ‘11581’ begins with doesn’t last long. The track’s dust-covered piano ramblings and cutlery-draw percussion are rudely interrupted in the latter half by waves of roaring distortion. The effect is powerfully physical, making the spoken word interval that follows all the more poignant. ‘Paradise II’ offers a period of reflection after Hansell’s noise-driven assaults. “You’ve visited this place before. Although it’s a sickening feeling, knowing you can see paradise from here” is dragged out from phone-receiver vocals, setting tone alongside Hansell’s discordant plastic organs and screeching feedback loops.</p>\n<p>‘Paradise’ saw it’s release late last month in conjunction with Lea Bertucci’s ‘Axis/Atlas’ split, making up the ninth and tenth releases on the label - a rather impressive feat considering the label was only founded sometime in 2014. Far from quantity over quality however, both these cassettes demonstrate a keen appreciation for sounds on the outer fringes of electronic music, and I am very much looking forward to hearing what the Providence, Rhode Island based label chooses to shed light on next.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/222944026&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>Shota Hirama</em></p>\n<p>100 years on from the opening of Cabaret Voltaire, Dadaism continues to influence. SIGNAL_DADA, a label based in Tokyo and New York, have been taking the notion of Dadaism to dizzying new heights. Typically, their releases create collages of found sounds and samples. However, unlike much of the current trajectory of modern industrial techno and noise, SIGNAL_DADA's music is very high definition, with a pristine clarity of production. Their themes arguably express the hyperactivity and alienation of modern digital culture. It therefore carries with it many of the same concerns of Post-Internet, but it's sharper, darker and more precise. As past of our ‘In Focus’ series, we caught up with label-boss Shota Hirama to talk about the ethos and aesthetic of this fresh and exciting project.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/147359913&color=959493&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>“Yes Dada is one of my enthusiasms”, he begins. “Especially photo-montage; a technique, using individual photographs combined together to create a new subject or visual image. With strong anti-war politics, most images are really strange and weird, negative and destructive, some are even nihilistic. John Heartfield, Hannah Hoch, Kurt Schwitters and Surrealists like Max Ernst, their art-works are super.” In 2016, however, SIGNAL_DADA are appropriating the techniques of collage and applying them to sampling. “My ideas and inspirations, techniques, all of my sources are taken from the photo-montage of Dada.”</p>\n<p>The label’s roots began in Tokyo’s record shops. “In the record shops I worked at, I met many good people; promoters, producers, label owners, and musicians like Hair Stylistics (Masaya Nakahara), Thurston Moore, Robert Lippok and so on. So for me to start creating music and running a label was not something special, but rather a really natural motivation”. Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, the music that influences SIGNAL_DADA comes from a wide spectrum. “When I was 14 or 15, I lived in New York, and my friend (who was from England) gave me this huge collection of mixtapes which contains really strange music. Nurse With Wound, Throbbing Gristle, Maurizio Bianchi, Swell Maps, guitar bands like Wire, Suicide, and some more alternative bands like Pavement, Sonic Youth (Bad Moon Rising-era, you know what I’m a huge SY freak man!)&quot;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1625/24645288941_cb1b6c8351_b.jpg\" alt=\"dada\">\nHannah Höch, <em>Cut with the Dada Kitchen Knife through the Last Weimar Beer-Belly Cultural Epoch in Germany</em>, 1919</p>\n<p>&quot;Those crazy mixtapes he gave me were awesome. I went back home to play it on my dad’s audio stuff, and I was like ‘wow holy shit!’ I still remember that shocking experience, I mean truly, I was shocked. Kids at 12 or 13 were all listening to Backstreet Boys or Green Day or that kind of MTV shit. That tape-experience was my big turning point. I’m so upset that I can’t find it anymore…” This openness to variation has enabled SIGNAL_DADA to be a fluid and flexible arena for musicians. For example, last year, we were treated to Yu Miyashita's <em>Homage</em>. This was an album that sounded distant from the cold harshness of Shotahirama's productions. To the contrary, listen to 'To Novalis' below for a moment of serene romanticism.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/217137796&color=95918f&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>The chosen artwork of the label stands in stark contrast to its music. Where artificial and synthetic elements stand as the central focus of the music, the visual accompaniments consist mostly as realist photography. “First of all, I don’t like to connect the images of music and artwork”, he continues. “For me, music and artwork must be in opposite positions. For example, on TV, or in Hollywood films, advertisements, Cafés like Starbucks, you can see everywhere, electronic music and minimalist designs, ambient music and atmospheric videos, guitar music and old fashioned boys and young modern girls. Coffee and Jazz? Noise and underground? I’m really sick of those stereotypes. I wanna try to make some big contrast, I want to make a strong <em>dis</em>-connection. So to be an ambivalent, to disconnect the images of music and the artwork, we tried to show the visuals in a more analogue and photographic way, not in an idealized or stereotypical way.&quot;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1534/24444752030_6ec5bebcc9_b.jpg\" alt=\"picture\">\n<em>Stiff Kittens</em></p>\n<p>Last summer, when I went to stay with Yu Miyashita - joint Stray Landings and SIGNAL_DADA signee - he mentioned to me the concept of ‘Post-Japanoise’. This reactive genre throws out the conservative tradition of Japanoise in favour of something far more applicable to the present day. Although Hirama denies that SIGNAL_DADA are a ‘post-Japanoise label’, he revealed to us his plans for something in that vein. “It's not the idea what SIGNAL_DADA is aiming for, it is the original idea from Miyashita and I, and this is what we want to do through our new unit-project ‘SIGNALARROW’”, he explains. “Japanoise is noise music formed by Japanese musicians, influenced by the overseas noise music scene from the 60s to 80s. Some are influenced by media-artists like Achim Wollscheid, some are influenced by mail-art culture like LAFMS, some are influenced by the industrial music of Maurizio Bianchi, and maybe some are influenced by drugs, beatniks and free-Jazz like in 70’s New York. Like Merzbow and Incapacitants, they mixed up with those original noise format/cultures with Japanese sub-cultures, Japanese humanity, Japanese history, Japanese philosophy, art, and identity.&quot;</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZnX77eRN3FI?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>&quot;Yu and I are calling this origin of Japanese noise music “Neo-noise music” which is what most people call  “Japanoise music”. The important thing about this term is that the musicians are Japanese. Japanoise is a mixture of Japanese identity and European or American noise music culture.” Hirama and Miyashita, by contrast, come from something of a cultural rhizome. “Miyashita and I do not have an original Japanese-identity. We are also not original Americans, nor Europeans. I was born in New York and lived in the United States for 12 years, but my parents are both Japanese and I have now lived in Tokyo almost 20 years. Miyashita lived in Europe for several years. We have both lost our original nationalities. The point is that Yu and I both have a mutated identity. We are mutants. But we are also noise musicians.”</p>\n<p>So what is the ‘post’ in ‘post-Japanoise’, then? “‘post-Japanoise’ is… that’s it, I can’t say anymore. If you want to read more, please wait for our big announcements. Stay tuned.”</p>\n<p>We will.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=134619944/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://shotahirama.bandcamp.com/album/nice-doll-to-talk\">NICE DOLL TO TALK by shotahirama</a></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>The DJ career of Bethany DeMoss seems to have approached somewhat unexpectedly. Brought up in Willis Texas before relocating after joining the US Navy, DeMoss was taken by surprise after dropping a friend from the naval base off at an outdoor rave. By the sounds of it, she hasn't looked back since.</p>\n<p>After moving to the UK, and with a little help from a chance meeting with Tony Childs aka Surgeon, DeMoss released a slew of brooding techno reductions on esteemed labels such as Horizontal Ground, Perc Trax and Semantica under the name DJ Skirt. She has also graced some of techno's best loved dancefloors around the world with her thundering no-holds-barred sets.</p>\n<p>With an upcoming performance at this years Bloc, we decided to catch up with DeMoss to discuss the festival, working with Semantica and free raves in Sierra Nevada.</p>\n<p><strong>Hi Beth, how are things? You're playing at Bloc in a couple of months - will this be your first time there?</strong></p>\n<p>Hi Stray Landings! Things are great, thanks. Yes, I am really looking forward to Bloc! I have been once before in 2009 and it was an absolutely fantastic weekend.  Never dreamed then I would be on the other side of the decks at Bloc myself someday, so I feel quite honoured to have been asked really.</p>\n<p><strong>I wanted to ask about your early musical experiences growing up in Texas. I read you went to quite a few parties out in the woods when you were living and in Sierra Nevada (I guess what we would call 'free raves' in the UK). Can you tell us a bit more about what those were like?</strong></p>\n<p>There wasn't a whole lot to do on the weekends for young people in my small town, Willis Texas, so in the high school years we would just find a spot out in the woods and park our cars up there.  Willis was fortunately within Houston’s broadcasting distance and there were broadcasts from Numbers &amp; Decadance night clubs in Houston late at night. A few guys were into having massive sound systems in their cars and trucks, so maybe that is where I first got a taste for actually feeling the bass.  They would open up their doors and there'd be instant outdoor party in the woods with a soundsystem!  Some personal favourite tunes I remember from these days were Poesie Noire’s ‘Pity for the Self’ and Vicious Pink's ‘C-C-Cant You See’.  There was lots of New Order, Depeche Mode, Front 242, Nitzer Ebb, Consolidated...  definitely inspirations for my yet unknown future.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/69428385&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>Those Texas parties were a good few years before the Sierra Nevada party.  The party out in the Sierra Nevada mountains I attended quite unintentionally, yet it transformed my views on the “rave” scene and changed my life in the end.  I was in the Navy then, and liked going to this goth/industrial club called The Trocadero in San Francisco. To my mind, “raves” were a completely separate world and I had very much decided that was not the scene for me.</p>\n<p>One day, there was this guy on the Navy base who didn’t have a car who said he would pay me to give him a lift to one of these 'rave parties' out in the mountains called The Light.  I was only doing it for the petrol money and was planning to turn around and come right home after dropping him off.  But when we got there, I immediately liked the music so much, I got out and walked around and it looked like no party I’d ever experienced at that point in my life. I have no idea who the DJs were or what music they were playing, but I was genuinely shocked, as this was nothing like I had expected.  The music was so good, the people were so friendly.  It was awesome.  Soon I was dancing in front of a speaker and danced there all night.  It had been dark when we arrived  but a few hours later the sun was coming up over the mountains and I could fully take in my surroundings.  It was very powerful!  I realised I was way up high on the side of a beautiful mountain, surrounded by strangers,  having one of the most magical experiences of my entire life. I knew something was happening that was going to change my life.  I felt I had discovered a new world, and I had!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1512/24172761713_0ecfa01aeb_z.jpg\" alt=\"arizona\"></p>\n<p><em>Arizona, 1999</em></p>\n<p><strong>Would the police ever come and try to shut them down? Do you think putting on parties in those kinds of 'illegal' spaces helps fuel the scene?</strong></p>\n<p>I suppose it's a law of human nature that when people are told they can't do something for no good reason, they will usually persevere if the will/desire is strong enough!  There was just so much red tape involved in putting together a good party back then because obviously the police/government wanted to make it virtually impossible, but that didn’t stop people wanting to go out and dance to good music together.  I think the use of illegal spaces was more of a last resort when all options to do things properly had been exhausted which was almost always (*or, of course, if it was felt that you could simply get away with it). It was frustrating for everyone when a party would get broken up; frustrating for the organisers, the DJs (who often would have their record bag confiscated), and frustrating for the party people.  I guess it did ignite a rebellious 'you won’t stop us' mentality, but I think people overall would have preferred to have been allowed to party on undisturbed if there had been some 'legal' way to do it!  I think use of illegal spaces was more of a consequential aspect of the scene rather than a pillar of it.</p>\n<p>Out in Texas, the Police would always bust our parties.  It was like clockwork.  Willis was tiny and we were loud, so… they always found us!  We had to be creative in coming up with new locations… (*I hope my Mom doesn't read this!)</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=957223422/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=884971438/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://semanticarecords.bandcamp.com/album/surgeon-svreca-skirt-untitled-semantica-50\">Surgeon / Svreca : Skirt - Untitled.

It seems like you had a strong interest in UK/European techno even back then - was it difficult to source those records?</strong></p>\n<p>I didn’t really start heavily buying dance records until I got my turntables in 1998.  By the time I got my mixing decks, I was living in California and so had plenty of record shops to choose from.  In my younger years in Texas, I bought many a record from Encore Records, a shop my friend George owned.  He would order in just about anything I wanted from this huge book of music, so I was very lucky for someone living out in the middle of nowhere to be able to do have access to global releases.  Thanks George!</p>\n<p><strong>Most recently you released the 'Mirage' EP on Trolldans which features a remix from Lakker, who you have also remixed in the past. What was your initial reaction when you first heard their interpretation? Was it fun to reimagine their material as well?</strong></p>\n<p>My first thought was something along the lines of 'phwoar!' because there is such a powerful sound to the remix, which I really love.  I really do enjoy the whole remix process, the fact that different artists can take the same parts and make a completely unique interpretation from the same. It is always intriguing to hear what someone will make out of my sounds.  It is fun also to make remixes, but a little more pressure as I am always concerned as to whether the people I am remixing will be happy with what I have done.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/189093273&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I'm a big fan of 'Tumulto' the ambient(ish) piece you released with Semantica. Can you tell us a bit about some of the beatless music which you take inspiration from?</strong></p>\n<p>Thanks very much, glad you like it!  I do really prefer to work away from the limits of the dancefloor in my production. The inspiration for all of my music is my environment and things that are happening in the world around me.  Making music is one way I can express my feelings about these things that I cannot often easily express in words. Each of my songs is inspired by something specific, maybe not from the start, but as they grow they find their meaning and they are always about something, a thought or reaction to something, a feeling about something, I try to recreate my thoughts or emotions in the music so that anyone who listens could step into that same feeling, even if they do not necessarily know what inspired that feeling in me.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1486/24681789592_6a9b9cbba2_b.jpg\" alt=\"rome\"></p>\n<p><em>Rome, 2014</em></p>\n<p><strong>What is it like working with Semantica? You and Svreca also did a track together which is your only collaboration on record right? How did that come about?</strong></p>\n<p>It is a real privilege to work with Semantica, as it is a label I respect and trust, without reservation.  There I feel a complete freedom to express myself in my music in the truest form.  It is true that Svreca is the only artist with whom I have directly collaborated and I really believe this is down to how much I trust him.  The funny thing is that I have not ever (yet!) managed to meet Svreca in person, some circumstance or another always seems to prevent this, but I am sure we will some day. We did not really discuss some big plan to work together on a track, but maybe we both recognised that our production style complimented the other, so it felt like a natural thing that our sounds worked together and the track was born.</p>\n<p><strong>What's next for yourself release wise? Any upcoming projects you are able to tell us about?</strong></p>\n<p>Release wise, there is a new original track coming out soon on Semantica as part of a celebratory compilation.  The label is celebrating its ten year anniversary this year! So keep your eyes peeled for news on that…   As for projects, I am in the process of writing an album.  I am aiming to get that out sometime in the next 10-15 years...</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/118827574&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>In Zürich on February 5th, 1916, Cabaret Voltaire opened its doors. It is here that we associate the birth of Dada, an artistic and political movement set squarely at the helm of the European Avant-Garde. The Dadaist’s eight soirees at Cabaret Voltaire between 1916-18 hosted evenings of surreal and bizarre performances, from costume theatre to poetry read in a made-up language. The name ‘Dada’ itself tells us a lot about this movement from the outset. Linguist Roman Jakobson has noted the universality of children’s first babble words. No matter what language your parents or community speak, the first sounds that come out of your mouth are going to be ‘mama’, ‘papa’ or something very similar. Dada was therefore a childlike expression of primordial vitality that we all share. A kind of primal scream that sought artistic progress through a psychological regress. It was a nonsensical statement, but one full to the brim with life and zest.</p>\n<p>Dada also represented an urge to start from scratch, to hit ‘reset’ on culture, and begin building again uncontaminated by the language and culture of Europe. Perhaps the technique most associated with Dada is 'cut-up'; an aleatoric method of jumbling text to create an assemblage of linguistic permutations. The idea was not so much to create something random, but to free the unconcious from the shackles of reason and syntax. As Tristan Tzara put it in 1920, &quot;the poem will resemble you&quot;. But once Dada had moved to the bustling rhizome of Berlin, it had become far more pointed in its critiques. Now it took aim at depicting the brutal reality of life, not just its naïve innocence. Cut-ups of newspaper articles, photographs and paintings showed culture as a simultaneous muddle, in all its messy complexity, at a time when the future was wholly unpredicable, especially for those living in the Weimar Republic. But what is the status of Dada today? Cities and Memory's new project, celebrating the centenary of Dada, hopes to answer that question.</p>\n<iframe style=\"background-color: transparent; display: block; max-width: 700px;\" title=\"audioBoom player\" src=\"//embeds.audioboom.com/boos/4102902-the-sound-of-sankt-nicolai-goes-dada/embed/v4?eid=AQAAAJ-yclaeVScA&wmode=transparent\" width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p>Cities and Memory invites people to share original and re-imaginations of field recordings, exploring “the relationships between sound and memory, and between places and their sounds”. This new project is based around an open global sound map, and is comprised of contributions inspired by Dada. The project has taken recordings from 28 countries, taking in everywhere from Iceland and Canada and from India to Vietnam. There are also recordings from iconic Dada locations including Berlin, Paris and the very doorstep of the Cabaret Voltaire in Zürich. These sounds have been cut-up and pasted into fascinating collages and rhythmical combinations. As they succintly put it on their website, the aim is to &quot;remix the world, one sound at at time&quot;. When we caught up with Stuart Fowkes, the creative mind behind the project, Cities and Memory had just invited submissions inspired by the Dada movement. “Cities and Memory starts from that softened, dreamlike imagination of a sound”, he began. “To see what happens when you hold a mirror up to sound”.</p>\n<p>This project fits perfectly with the Dadaist belief that the truth of music can never be reached through words (which is why little text on their music ever materialised). Their legacy and “sense of ‘anything goes’ slices right through most contemporary art, coming along with a prototype of the ‘all sound is music’ rationale underpinning so much of today’s sound art”, he explains. Dadaism, like many of the post-war movements, wanted to return to the fundamentals of sound. Gone was the fanciful idealism of armchair-thinking, and in its place an acceptance of the chaotic rush of the high-street. “If you tried hard enough you could retrospectively apply a Dada explanation to almost any reimagined sound piece. It wouldn’t take much to claim a use of abstraction or collage, for instance.”</p>\n<p>This therefore also includes assemblages, and sound poems, and although rarely directly related back to Dada, the abundant response to his Dada project shows there must be a lot of sounds artists “who are heavily inspired by Dada and who use its techniques almost daily”. This ethos can perhaps be best applied to field-recordings. Fowkes goes on; “some field recordists have a somewhat tense relationship with city soundscapes and their throbbing, repetitive machinery. Drones don’t tend to exist in the natural world — the soundscape tends to be dominated by discrete bursts of noise across the frequency spectrum. As machinery and traffic levels increase and urbanisation grows, cities increasingly sound the same, which is problematic not just for us recordists but at a much more serious level in terms of society, culture and even public health.”</p>\n<iframe style=\"background-color: transparent; display: block; max-width: 700px;\" title=\"audioBoom player\" src=\"//embeds.audioboom.com/boos/4036653-welt-voll-irrsinn-in-sweden/embed/v4?eid=AQAAAJ-yclaeVScA&wmode=transparent\" width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p>Interestingly, this again harks back to the technological obsession of the Futurists, and their influence on Dada. “There is beauty in unique mechanical sounds and indeed older mechanical sounds are starting to become fetishised as we preserve their sounds — we’ve had recent submissions of rooms full of old clocks, printing presses or even WW2 coding machines. But where those mechanical sounds aren’t unique, interesting or worth preserving in and of themselves, the process of reimagining a mechanical sound can be a way of talking about our relationships with technology or with the urban environment. How can we play with the sounds of traffic to create something interesting that might help people reconsider how they listen to the environment that surrounds them?”</p>\n<p>Cities and Memory believe that the Dada approach to music has a uniqueness in that, even after 100 years, it remains firmly transgressive. But this project hopes to assimilate it into a wider accessibility. “Some stuff that might have been considered wildly experimental drone music ten years ago is now approaching wide popularity. And the wonderful thing is that definitions of what constitutes music can only get broader and more inclusive — every tiny step taken widens the path for everything else in the future.</p>\n<p>“In the grand scheme of things, the ‘all-sound-is-music/art’ philosophy is still very much outside the mainstream…but the more music mixes together wildly disparate influences, the more interesting takes on sound design can find their way into TV and film and the more sound can infiltrate in the mainstream in terms of exhibitions and museums, the closer we are to normalising such views and achieving a little more in the way of acceptance.”</p>\n<p>You can listen to the entire Cities and Memory archive of Dada sound <a href=\"http://citiesandmemory.com/dadasounds/\">here</a>.</p>\n<iframe style=\"background-color: transparent; display: block; max-width: 700px;\" title=\"audioBoom player\" src=\"//audioboom.com/boos/4117840-amsterdam-assemblage/embed/v4?eid=AQAAAJ-yclaeVScA&wmode=transparent\" width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Pleasant isn’t a word I’d expect to use to describe an album put out by Bedouin Records (or in this case, their cassette-only sister label, Bastakiya Tapes). However, the label is notoriously hard to define, so maybe it’s not so surprising that this latest output, from Martijn Comes, is such a pleasure to listen to. In fact, judging by their first four releases, the young sub-label is focused less on techno and more concerned with releasing atmospheric, beatless drones, experiments and acoustic arrangements. That isn’t to say this offering is lacking the abrasion that generally characterises Bedouin releases, but it is an altogether more subtle release. Abrasion is certainly still present at times, but appears fleetingly, between crackling atmospheres and orchestral timbres.</p>\n<p><em>Radio Oblivion</em> is an album that feels embedded in the cassette format (which makes it a shame that at the moment at least, I’m listening to it digitally). It is nonetheless an atmospheric, winding listen. Opening with dense, chaotic tones, the album quickly settles into its second track, 'Song Of The Rock To Rise'. This is a warm, slow and considered piece, orchestral strings slowly brought into the mix among glowing pads. The album proceeds to wind through a range of textures, at times shimmering and intense, at others understated, at one point even descending into silence mid-track.</p>\n<p>For me, the highlight is in the albums last track, 'Keep On Rowing', a collaboration with Yiannis Kotsonis. There is a slowly shifting melody before it unexpectedly rings into silence, ending the album. On each of my listens this abrupt ending has unexpectedly returned me to reality, and each time has put into perspective the warm atmosphere I’ve been pleasantly soaked in for the last 38 minutes.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/243067848&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Founded in 1999, Berlin’s CTM festival has become a benchmark for underground experimental music festivals. The festival — formerly Club TransMediale — has an enormous scope, describing itself as a place for “adventurous music and related visual arts”. Anything within that bracket is to be expected. Stretching out over 9-days, with 15 venues and 173 acts, it can be dizzying trying to see even a fraction of the events being held. There are exhibitions of light, sound, DJ sets, interactive workshops and talks. Given this, any review of the festival is going to be only part of the story, but here are a few of our highlights.</p>\n<p>Last month, we spoke to this year’s CTM curator, Rabih Beaini. The underlying theme of the festival this time round, he told us, was ‘New Geographies’. “The main focus is how things communicate from one place to another in the world, and how the transformation of many traditional practices are interpreted today and projected into the future.” This is immediately clear from the festivals central exhibition: Seismographic Sounds. Here, multimedia artworks presented a range of perspectives on music today. One billboard read: “‘Gangnam Style’ by South Korean rapper Psy was a first step. Future hit songs and underground trends will come from Africa, Asia and Latin America. Produced and financed locally, without the support of Euro-American agents.”</p>\n<p>In another room, a series of screens played recordings from Skype interviews across the world, asking and answering fundamental questions about the current climate of electronic music. When asked ‘can a bedroom producer change the world?’ there were philosophical responses from AGF, “the question is can we have 7 billion forms of creativity”, as well as some from more fatalist contributors: “not if you stay in bed”. I had heard of the brilliant Disarm project through Beaini, but seeing it play live was astonishing. The idea is similar to that of Felix’s machines: self-playing instruments triggering sounds using everything from e-bows to piano mallets. With Disarm, however, disused weaponry operate as the fundamental vehicle of sound. AK47 cartridges and boxes of ammunition rattle and shake around the room, giving a chilling depiction of a chaotic war-zone.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1583/24335178414_66579a034b_b.jpg\" alt=\"disarm\">\n<em>Disarm</em></p>\n<p>One of the most unique things about the festival is its wide spread of venues. Largely clustered around Kreuzberg, there’s a good excuse for walking through Berlin’s graffitied side-streets and overgrown parks. One such venue that is always a treat to visit is the colossal Kraftwerk, a once abandoned power-station above Tresor that now holds some of Berlin’s most exciting events. It was here that ‘Deep Web’ was situated — an awesome audiovisual performance from Christopher Bauder and Robert Henke. Set to dust covered drones and musique concrète, this exhibition is a spectacle of dangling baubles that lift and fall, creating intricate constellations of light and motion, giving the illusion that they are free falling. Now, it’s fair to say that almost anything held in Kraftwerk is going to stunning. But Henke and Bauder have used the space to its maximum potential, giving the structure an oddly animated feel between its concrete pillars. The idea of the ‘web’ too is significant. The spheres of light work together like a network of nodes, a geometric representation of the cross-continental influence of the ‘new geographies’.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1487/24669741600_1c34027e77_b.jpg\" alt=\"kraftwerk\">\n<em>Deep Web</em>, Kraftwerk // Photo by Camille Blake</p>\n<p>CTM also hosts talks throughout the festival with its various contributors. This gives a face to many of the otherwise anonymous exhibitions, and furthermore provides a much needed context for the diaspora of events. For example, if you can stand the noxious corporatism, the Red Bull Music Academy host interviews with some of the festivals most celebrated artists, this year including Pauline Oliveros and Keiji Haino. I caught a talk with Mumdance, who shared the intricacies of his production techniques and explained the roots of the ‘weightless’ style. There were also workshops on circuit bending and instrument building.</p>\n<p>Arguably the most celebrated of the various venues that can be explored throughout the week is Berghain and its Panorama Bar. Given the venue’s notoriety for its door policy, and countercultural clientele, it was only a matter of time before it became too famous for the underground and had to shed its dogmatic loyalty to the techno genre. This is probably a good thing too, since what’s the point of a counterculture that has its doors closed to difference? It was interesting to hear how the unfamiliar timbre of noise, drone, trap and R&amp;B sounded inside. It questioned a previously held belief that  the dominant rumble of brooding Berlin techno has an inherent association with the building’s architecture. The truth is that the venue is too good to be ghettoised into a single genre.</p>\n<p>Japanese duo Group A, for example, filled with the space with jarring viola tones and deafening screeches. Aïsha Devi &amp; Tianzhuo Chen by contrast washed the walls with tidal waves of reverb-drenched atmospherics. Neither sounded displaced or unwelcome there. In Panorama Bar too, Jlin, Nidia Minaj, nkisi and KABLAM brought together sounds more current or futuristic than anything I had heard at the festival, or at Berghain previously. There were high definition sound effects, hyperactive vocal loops and even Erykah Badu’s remix of 'Hotling Bling'. Surprise guest performances from Nina Kraviz and Bearice Dillon are also always welcome...</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1660/24669966340_985fb5b94a_b.jpg\" alt=\"group\">\n<em>Group A</em>, Berghain // Photo by Camille Blake</p>\n<p>However, the appearance of Hatsune Miku was perhaps the most anticipated of the festival. ‘Hatsune Miku’ translates as ‘first sound of the future’. This couldn’t be more apt, since the blue-haired “virtual pop star” is spearheading a new form of music production and consumption. Using a ‘Vocaloid’ vocoder synthesiser that samples the voice of Saki Fujita, Miku’s fans are capable of writing songs for her. Consequently, she can boast over 10,000 singles released across continents, and fills out stadiums of adoring fans, performing as a 3-D hologram.</p>\n<p>But ‘Still Be Here’, the performance showing at CTM, was quite different. Rather than a standard setlist of her most popular singles, ‘Still Be Here’ was a conceptual piece about the identity and <em>idea</em> of Miku herself, soundtracked by the brilliant Laurel Halo. As people took their seats, a creepy childlike voice explained in meticulous detail the legalities of writing music for Miku. Between footage of her various guises, performances and cosplay-wearing fans, we also heard conversations with the creator of the project, as well as cultural theorists discussing the significance of such an idea through the lens of gender politics and the ‘future’ of capitalism. As the pop star’s reality became more and more scrutinised, it became clear that what her fans really love is not so much Miku as an individual, but rather the collective engagement and camaraderie of all her creators.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1570/24334828614_c5c316e5e7_b.jpg\" alt=\"miku\">\n<em>Still Be Here</em>, Haus der Kulturen der Welt (HKW) // Photo by Camille Blake</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>If you'd asked me about dance music in Australia a few years ago, I'd probably have mumbled some nonsense about that kid who refused to take his sunglasses off during a news report after accidentally-on-purpose throwing a massive, massive house party. These days however, I've discovered some more nuanced examples to quote from. This is thanks largely to the guidance of one label, 3BS Records. Alongside supporting the projects of its founder, Jon Papert aka Mannheim Rocket, 3BS has also managed to cast a spotlight on a plethora of underrepresented talent in the region. It's latest muse comes in the form of Hence Therefore, project of Sydney based Simon Unwin.</p>\n<p>While 'Machine for Destroying Value' may only be the first release from the moniker, the depth of production makes it clear this is far from Unwin's first exploration into the world of electronic music. Listen to the crater dwelling atmospherics 'Cicada Death Roll' for example - there is a considered exactness to the tracks obscured bass rumbles and swelling chords. 'Kaputar Plateau' is approached with even greater levels of precision. The offering places dubbed-out percussion alongside rattling, paranoid atmospheres, a precedent set right from the outset of the release.</p>\n<p>Opener 'Anxiety Dream Terrain' shuffles forward lethargically, chords billowing forward like rolling clouds. As the track is gently filtered to silence, Unwin lays his clattering percussive elements bare, shuddering and distorted. Heavily processed drums are another hallmark retained throughout, as if heard underground, unnatural sonic artifacts echoing across the stereo field. Take 'North Pacific Gyre' or 'Hyperobject'. While the former's pointed rhythms step carefully between musty, funeral home organs and faintly menacing stabs, the latter slowly builds to a cacophony of shimmering metallic dub. As the release's closer it ends full of tension, leaving the listener suspended in thought.</p>\n<p>Aside from the release's success sonically, it is also nice to see Unwin using the platform as a vessel for political sentiment. The release's artwork depicts a giant coal mining machine. The irony, in Unwin's own words being that it is &quot;mining a very commercially profitable commodity, but also destroying something more valuable at the same time.&quot; Hence the title, 'Machine For Destroying Value', taken from a Francis Spufford book about the Soviet Union. Tracks titles like 'North Pacific Gyre' conjure up similar notions of the destructive effects of capitalism, the ocean current being the largest site of man-made waste on the planet.</p>\n<p>I have often wondered about the capabilities dance and experimental music has in exploring themes of this nature, the absence of explicit lyrical content often making these ideas seem like they are tacked on after. This said, in the case of this release, the message seems clearly thought out, consistent and most importantly, in keeping with the stifling soundspaces which comprise it sonically.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3917224289/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://3bsrecords.bandcamp.com/album/machine-for-destroying-value\">Machine For Destroying Value by Hence Therefore</a></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>If William Basinski had used an early 2000s CD Player rather than a tape reel to craft his legendary experiment in sonic decay, 'Disintegration Loops', it would probably have some strong parallels with <em>Singulum</em>. The release is the latest offering from Montreal based composer and installation artist France Jobin.</p>\n<p>Across her rather substantial career, Jobin has displayed work in galleries everywhere from South Africa to Japan, as well as releasing on a number of different labels. <em>Singulum</em> sees her return to an old residence, LINE Recordings. The label has hosted the likes of Alva Noto, Mark Fell and Yves De Mey since its founding at the start of the millennium, and Jobin's work finds a fitting home here.</p>\n<p>Take the washing flourishes of piano across the opening track, 'n'. Between fragile buzzes of phone-line glitch, modem scratches linger in the backdrop. Jobin also uses her drawn out structures to give shifts in the production full impact. On 'I', creeping arps and digitised chimes linger as long as possible before giving way to Jobin's faintly ominous drones.</p>\n<p>The timidly developing soundscapes of this release build up to its closing piece, 's'. The track makes for one of <em>Singulum</em>'s boldest statements, meditative pools of ambience are left void of further embellishment in an offering of streamlined introspection. Towards the tracks latter half a swelling chord makes repeat appearances; a feature that wouldn't sound out of place in Deepchord or Fluxion's output.</p>\n<p>Jobin has cited quantum physics as a strong inspiration for <em>Singulum</em>. She uses a range of audio processing tools to remove her carefully selected field recordings from their original context. In this pursuit, Jobin has  endeavored to highlight just how flexible sampling materials can be, creating a release which lingers, its subtle yet graceful motifs rattling around the brain for hours after the final track.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 274px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4225136994/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://lineimprint.bandcamp.com/album/singulum\">Singulum by FRANCE JOBIN</a></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Late last year we were offered the exciting opportunity to hold a much belated celebration for our Yu Miyashita 12” on pioneering Japanese music streaming service, Dommune. Among the performers, we were able to host Yukitomo Hamasaki, founder of independent label, mAtter. Over his hour long set, Hamasaki proved himself a man of diverse tastes. Funk-tinged hip-hop, downbeat piano movements and even John Lennon’s ‘Give Peace A Chance’ were included, and a similarly wide-array of pursuits are represented on the label.</p>\n<p>mAtter's latest release for example, <em>Six Pieces For Guitar</em> by Belgian sound-artist Stijn Hüwels, explores meditative loops crafted from carefully processed guitar and field recordings. Hüwels’ interest in minimalism is clear to see, even before listening to the release. The release’s cover is a deep, off-colour white, devoid of further embellishment aside from a modest typeface stating the title. Similarly, the tracks are simply titled ‘Untitled I-IV’, leaving it up to the listener to interpret each theme.</p>\n<p>The secondary effect of this is that you consider the release as a single work - something befitting seeing as the tracks enjoy similar tonal palettes. The ebbing melancholia of ‘Untitled I’ sets the tone for the rest of the album, the most notable progression being Hüwels’ gently increasing use of foley, timidly drawing the listener in deeper, one found-sound at a time.</p>\n<p>However, ‘Untitled VI’ closes with one of the album’s most lasting moments. Hüwels ditches the washing ambience of former tracks for something decidedly more dynamic. Tremors of fluttering guitar set a wistful and introspective tone that wouldn’t be out of place in a Gustavo Santaolla soundtrack.</p>\n<p>One of the things that interested me most about this release was the way in which the context surrounding it dictates your experience. My patience for what you might deem space-gazing guitar music wears thin at times, yet Hüwels’ consistently minimalist, clearly thought out approach makes <em>Six Pieces For Guitar</em> a considered and mature sounding release. His own movements, and mAtter’s at large I am very much looking forward to tracking over the coming year.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/244077573&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>I wasn't quite sure what to make of the work of Anna Vtorova, aka Machine Woman the first time I heard it. Her productions explore a wealth of genres, blending the clinical precision of Raster-Noton releases with the raw, anything goes improvisation of early noise and industrial scenes. Having released her ‘For Sweden’ EP on Peder Mannerfelt’s ‘Peder Mannerfelt Produktion’ label late last year, her work has begun to gather notable attention, highlighted in Fact Magazine's '10 house &amp; techno producers to watch in 2016' feature for example. Having mused over the wide-array of different locations cited in her press materials previously, we decided to catch up with Vtorova to set the record straight. &quot;Yes I'm 100% Russian&quot; she begins when asked her origins. &quot;Wait hold on, actually I have Ukrainian, Karelian and a bit of Polish heritage too...  I guess I'm 100% Eastern Bloc. I lived in Leningrad until I was 14 - the '90s were brutal in Russia. Still, I think many things are the same today...&quot;</p>\n<p>Subsequently Vtorova moved to Nottingham, UK, and just last Summer relocated to Berlin (if you want to know why, she suggests listening to 'Be Quiet And Drive (Far Away)' by the Deftones). The other week she was also able to visit Sweden, home of her most recent label boss Peder Mannerfelt. &quot;A few weeks ago I played in Sweden - I went after work. I am very grateful my bosses let me follow my dream,&quot; she begins when asked on the visit. &quot;I was nervous as I hate flying and also it was my first show in a long time. After my last show I was not sure if I wanted to play live ever again.... But an offer to play Sweden changed my mind and I am glad.&quot;</p>\n<p>Comprising her first vinyl release, 'For Sweden' covers six skittish sonic experiments, broken metallic textures clattering against one another. As for the EP's title, the origins are much simpler than you might imagine. &quot;I named a folder on my computer because I knew the tracks would be sent to Sweden (to Peder) so it was just an easy way for me to find my tracks on my computer. I wish I could tell you a more magical story....&quot;</p>\n<p>Prior to this Vtorova also graced Tesla Tapes - the label fronted by fluctuating psychedelic outfit Gnod, with a five track cassette of decidedly more noisey explorations.  &quot;We played a show together in London when I was in Female Band (one of my other projects)&quot; she begins when quizzed on her interactions with the collective. &quot;A couple of years later I played this abandoned warehouse in Manchester or Salford... It was a pretty extreme place with part of the roof missing. Kenny Love, one of my mates asked me to play. Then I moved to Salford and my flatmate was Chris from Gnod. After that show I got an offer to play Islington Mill and the night 'Gesamtkunstwerk'. Later, Paddy who runs Tesla Tapes label asked if I wanted to release a cassette and I said sure, why not...&quot;</p>\n<p>The focus hasn't always been electronic music for Vtorova however. She has played in a number of different bands, collaborations and other assorted projects bringing varying degrees of satisfaction. &quot;Sometimes it was fun and sometimes it was very frustrating experience&quot; she begins when asked about her previous endeavours. &quot;I started when I was 17. I got a Saturday job at a local bakery, saved money and got myself a drumkit. My mum was erm.... very happy about that.... That summer I spend a lot of time by myself in my garage listening to the Deftones and Slipknot and trying to play drums. Now many years later I spend a lot of time by myself on my computer and still try to play drums....(machines), and still listen to Slipknot and Deftones... Chino Moreno once sang one of The Cure songs to me but that's another story....&quot;</p>\n<p>Vtorova's mix for us covers 64 minutes of tracks which have influenced the project, assorted house and techno mutations ebbing and flowing between one another. As for future plans for Vtorova, it's anyone's guess. &quot;Well, my life has been pretty interesting lately. I might start an Aphex Twin tribute act...&quot;</p>\n<p>No tracklist available.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0058-machine-woman%2F&hide_cover=1&hide_artwork=1\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Where many have explored the link between meditative dub-techno and ocean-deep ambience, few have managed to create a blend quite as cohesive as Konstantinos Soublis AKA Fluxion. Whether you're listening in a cramped office block, bustling tube full of resentful commuters or a dull-lit supermarket isle, Fluxion has the power to transport you to a place of pure zen.</p>\n<p>While his later work has mainly ended up on Kenneth Christiansen's Echocord label, his early productions found their home with Chain Reaction, a successor to the label frontier of Basic Channel. It is here that the two <em>Vibrant Forms</em> albums were first released, compiling tracks from a series of 12&quot;s that would have likely set you back a small fortune. In late 2013 Type Recordings saw fit to reissue the first of these compiled works, and earlier this week we were treated to the reissue of <em>Vibrant Forms II</em> by Barcelona based Subwax BCN. Subwax began their history as a record store in Malmö, relocating to Barcelona in 2013 and evolving into both a label and distribution network along the way. If this weren't enough they also find the time to support a range of sub-labels, including the excellently curated SonuoS, so I should probably take the time to write a very long and sincere thank you letter to them for all the mindblowing music they have brought to my ears over the years (maybe this is it).</p>\n<p>As with the first edition of <em>Vibrant Forms</em>, the remarkable thing about <em>Vibrant Forms II</em> is how well it holds together when considered as an LP, despite the fact these tracks were paired together after they'd been released on various EPs and singles. Soublis leaves a vapour trail of recognisable threads from one track to the next. Take the subtle shifts between 'Prospect II' and 'Oblique' for example; warm, intoxicating chords billowing ghostly between clattering drum work.  At times, the record submerges into the depths, such as 'Aviation', which plummets into the unknown. The effect calls to mind a submarine silently gliding across the ocean floor, alien creatures floating in and out of sight through the blackness. As an opener to disk two, the track makes a perfect palette cleanser, in preparation for the woozy slow-motion dub of 'Bilateral Motion' or 'Omnibus'.</p>\n<p>Over a decade has passed since this material was originally released, yet similarly to fellow Chain Reaction signees Vladislav Delay, Vainqueur or Shinichi Atobe, Soublis' works seem to have barely dated in the last fifteen years, making it unsurprising this re-release marks just one of many from the Chain Reaction catalogue.</p>\n<p><em>Vibrant Forms II is available now from the <a href=\"http://www.store.subwaxbcn.com/#1454091042021-20476281-a24f\">Subwax BCN webstore</a>.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/181691500&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>This year's CTM festival made a point of challenging some of the long-held conceptions around Berlin and its musical legacy. The festival brought together artists from across the globe to showcase the sprawling impact that the city has had on global music and the myriad external influences on the city, too. In one memorable performance, Japanese duo group A played to a crowd of stunned on-lookers in the sweaty main room of the renowned Berghain. Typically home to cold, high-sheen techno, group A reappropriated the venue for their own devices, blaring discordant violins and deafening screams. Sonically, group A draw upon the darker side of sound: jarring juxtapositions of tone, incomprehensible shouting and metallic production style all feature heavily. They also carry with them an unmistakable visual identity. Their live shows almost always involve some form of theatricality, from semi-naked body painting on step-ladders to experimental costume design. Last month, we caught up with Tommi Toyko and Sakaya Botanic from the band to talk about the release of their latest album, Brutalist architecture, and the Pacific war.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3918047157/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://groupa.bandcamp.com/album/70-a\">70 + a = by group A</a></iframe>\n<p><strong>2015 seems to have been quite pivotal in the progression of group A.</strong></p>\n<p>Tommi: The busiest year of my entire life. Never worked so hard before, I got maybe like 3 hours sleep each night for the whole year. I was at design college and had a graduate exhibition in the spring. I took a photography course on my final year, so the first quarter of 2015 I spent the majority of my time taking photographs of Brutalist architecture and developing them in the dark room. After the graduation we decided to tour in Europe as thats one thing we couldn't have done because of my college. We had a small tour in May, and a big tour in September through the end of October. Between those two tours we made our latest album.</p>\n<p>Sayaka: Yeah, last year had so many chapters. We traveled a lot, played in so many places we'd never been or ever imagined to be, and we have met many people who opened the new paths to us. As for myself, I was lucky enough to have many chances to join improv sessions with many kind of musicians and see an alternative way of exploring myself as a violinist, it has had quite large effect on group A I believe.</p>\n<p><strong>I saw you play at Berghain the other day. How was that? Was really refreshing to hear some different instruments in that space!</strong></p>\n<p>Tommi: As our first show after we moved to Berlin, it couldn't have been better than that. Felt welcome. Berghain is the first club we'd ever been to in Berlin, many many years ago. It was before we started getting involved with making music. Never ever imagined I'd play there...</p>\n<p>Sayaka: Amazing sound system as you could imagine, especially the low end... you could actually feel the vibration on the stage. I've learnt a lot from the show, how I need to create the sound in a big venue and for a big crowd.</p>\n<p><strong>I read that you wanted to move to Berlin because it was too hard to live as a musician in London and Tokyo. Is the city living up to your expectations?</strong></p>\n<p>Tommi: That's basically the biggest reason why we moved here. We worked on group A a lot in the last 4 years in Tokyo, and thanks to everyone who have supported us, we kept on growing and got busier and busier. But we were still making almost no money then. This kind of music is very underground in Japan and it could never become a business. After two European tours last year we felt like we have reached the point where we needed to move to somewhere else where we could find the time to concentrate on music. There was no other way of continuing what we were doing, really.</p>\n<p>Sayaka: As Tommi mentioned, it is extremely difficult to make your own living as a musician in Tokyo unless your parents are rich or something. Even though some pop musicians won't be able to make it. You have to have another whatever-part-time-job and make music in spare time. When I started group A in 2012, I was working full-time and let out all the stresses from weekdays at group A shows and rehearsals... which was actually a good start of us to be honest, but you just exhaust yourself and lose your creativity at the end. So we made a great decision we believe!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1599/25171374259_b2f0370183_b.jpg\" alt=\"groupa\"></p>\n<p><strong>You just released your third album, <em>70 + a =</em>. Can you tell us a little bit about your thinking behind this record, and the direction you headed in musically?</strong></p>\n<p>Tommi: After our first small tour in Europe in May last year, I felt like we needed to make a new album for the next tour as it was going to be our first proper tour, and it had been more than a year and a half since we made our last record. We already had some unreleased tracks we wanted to put, such as 'Suffocated', 'Labyrinth' and 'B.O.R.E.' so we just worked on a few new tracks to go with them. In Japan it was the 70 years anniversary of the end of the Pacific war in the summer last year, and in that memorable year the government was debating the national security bills that would expand the roll of the self-defense forces. We had the great constitution of Japan which have kept us away from wars for 70 years and now it was going to be destroyed. So it was very controversial and a big topic for even young generations like us (before that politics wasn't a very common topic for young generation in Japan). There were loads of demonstrations going on too, and we were just full of anger at the government, and fear for war. So we put all that feelings into the new tracks, naturally became quite political, lyrically. One of the tracks is about a teenage victim of Nagasaki atomic bomb. Now you could probably guess what the title means, it's an album group A made on the 70th anniversary of the war, the result is what you can hear through the album.</p>\n<p><strong>And this was the primary motivation behind making the album?</strong></p>\n<p>Sayaka: Angers to the government led ourselves to make the album. In terms of musical influence, I just explored something from very deep inside of myself while we were recording.</p>\n<p>Tommi: Yeah I stop listening to other people's music when I make my own music so I don't think I was influenced by anything in particular. I try to avoid getting influenced by anything actually.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1654/25539070435_d050d61afc_b.jpg\" alt=\"groupa2\"></p>\n<p>**I understand that your album was recorded live at Tokyo's underground venue, Soup. One thing that has struck me about Tokyo's venues is how quiet all the venues were, and how early they closed. Has it always been like that? How is this effecting the music scene in Tokyo? **</p>\n<p>Sayaka: Maybe it's because we don't have a night bus and everyone has to catch the last train so all the venues close early. We also have some stupid law that prohibits the late night opening of clubs. It really is a big shame we don't have much of a club culture in Japan.</p>\n<p><strong>It's interesting because the live shows seems so central to group A. It's almost like performance art.</strong></p>\n<p>Tommi: We never try and focus on performance, we just happened to dress and perform like that. Watching a show or a gig is an experience. It's not just about the sound, but also what you see, feel and smell. You should be using all your senses. As long as there is an audience watching us we would like to give them the whole experience.</p>\n<p>Sayaka: We always try to make the records sound very 'live'. We've been listening to lots of 70s-80s music and what fascinates us is the rough (a little too fuzzy) sound from their original recording. I also listen to high-resolution music which is great obut when it comes to group A, we love to package the full-energetic sound as we explode on the stage.</p>\n<p>Tommi: The latest album was live recorded but the 2nd album was different, quite opposite I think. It'll keep changing, depends on the theme of the record. Every album is different.</p>\n<p>**Lastly, what can we expect to hear from group A in 2016? **</p>\n<p>Sayaka: We have just set up our studio in Berlin and started jamming. There are some hint of new songs and they sound quite different from other group A works... hopefully releasing a new record on vinyl, and we are hoping to play many festivals in EU too, we are very much looking forward to it!</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142178588?color=e1e8eb&portrait=0\" width= 100% height=\"321\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Prior to visiting Copenhagen a couple of years back, my knowledge of the city's music scene was limited to say the least, assuming most of the regions best music would be found on the other side of the Øresund strait, in Sweden. However, after exploring the city, I discovered a vibrant local scene, free from some of the attitudes you find somewhere as oversaturated as London.</p>\n<p>One ambassador of the city's music scene I was able to meet over there was Gabriella Vergilov - a regular selector of Culture Box, a club so highly regarded, it has received government support. As she explains however, for many years she only visited as a punter. &quot;My interest in DJing started slowly. Out dancing, I was always in front of the DJ booth, staring at the man playing records. I was intrigued. Two years ago I finally started playing records. It's a man’s world out there and the only way of being comfortable in my own skin was to trust and believe in the music I love and play. I used to DJ at Culture Box while living in Copenhagen. The place actually helped me reshape my taste in techno. It became my school, my second home. I met many of my favourite artists there and made good friendships.&quot;</p>\n<p>She explains; &quot;I remember the first time I got offered a gig there by one of the residents, DJ Kong. He came to me and said 'Hey listen, I never heard you play but I have a good feeling about you. I see you have passion, sense and dedication. Would you like to play?' It was my first serious offer and it was at the place I dreamt of playing one day. Once I stopped at Culture Box’s office to say Hi to the owner - Kenneth Christiansen - and he was well, very generous giving me twenty EPs from the Echochord catalogue! I believe some of my friends who were also into that kind of music got a bit jealous...&quot;</p>\n<p>Currently however, Vergilov is residing in Berlin, pursuing her career as a DJ and producer in a more active manner. &quot;Once I put my foot on the Berlin zebra, I knew I was going to be moving there,&quot; she begins when asked on the move. &quot;It happened in a very organic way. At some point I realised I probably have more contacts here than in Copenhagen. I adore its liveliness and the clash between the rational and the irrational. I say irrational because we all know what happens when you go out dancing on a Sunday afternoon and 'forget' to go home!&quot;</p>\n<p>Recently, Vergilov has secured a release on Brooklyn-based Thema Records, blending 4/4 rhythms with her own vocal experiments. As she explains, her music is a product of a number of different processes. &quot;As a very physical and visual person I cannot imagine myself writing a song using software alone&quot; she begins when asked on the topic. &quot; Sometimes I sit, listen and try to guess if a track is software or hardware programmed. In the studio, I like to take control over machines and abuse them as much as I can. I’ve learned much more by making mistakes than following the rules. I use vocals with a lot of layering, filter, delay, transposition and so on. My voice is in almost 90% of my productions and the release for Thema will prove that. I made a kick drum by hitting my mattress and I actually used that one of the tracks that’s coming on the release.&quot;</p>\n<p>Her mix for us covers over an hour of house and techno, in her own words; &quot;I included quality music that resonates with my perception of time, space, sound and experience. I basically improvised and put music that most of all, feels right to be there.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist</strong></p>\n<p>Pittsburgh Track Authority - The Standard [Work Them] <br>\nFour Tet - Buchla (Seven Davis JR Remix) [Text Records] <br>\nOptic Nerve - One Moment In Time [Puzzlebox Records] <br>\nFlori - Unsettling [Secret Sundaze] <br>\nDJ Qu - Warrior Dance [Strength Music] <br>\nAcid Jesus - Radium [Klang] <br>\nSev Dah - Shaban (Antigone Remix) [Techno Gipsy] <br>\nArthur Kimskii - She Survived [L.A.G] <br>\nHawkinson - Draisen (Mike Wall Remix) [Phunkit Records] <br>\nPhillippe Petit - Venus [Ear To Ground] <br>\nAntigone - The Toymaker [Children Of Tomorrow] <br>\nDamon Wild &amp; Tim Taylor - Bang The Acid Rebanged!

    "content": "<p>Honzo is usually referenced as the side-project of D.Carbone - an Italian producer now residing in techno Mecca, Berlin. It might be tempting to argue the project is becoming a little less of a sideline affair for Mr. Carbone however. Early last year he released 'Das Unheimliche' via noise-punk-squatter outfit Haunter Records, and almost exactly a year later, has joined the ranks of Marco Berardi fronted Aboretum Records with the 'Melancholia' EP.</p>\n<p>The differences between the tracks tagged as D. Carbone and those tagged under the Honzo alias are numerous, however the use of distortion doesn't appear to be one. Take 'Lovesickness' or 'Orientalism' - both are caked in jagged layers of overdrive, stuttered rhythms jolting forward, leaving a trail of dust and grit in their wake. While the former sees harshly filtered pan-flutes and shuddering low-end working together in menacing formations, the latter throbs forward with grunting, amp-driven toms and quivering hi-end.</p>\n<p>Organic, improvisational textures are maintained to the last, as if the whole EP had been written out in score and handed over to a doom-metal group to interpret. Take the crunching drones of ‘Moral Masochism’ for example, there is a distinctly human quality to them, difficult to replicate on software alone. As the track reaches its peak, we are barraged with twisted laser samples and off-beat snares, a feature capitalised on by Shadows in their remix of the track. The piece works steadily into a bedraggled climax before the achingly drawn out space-ambience of ‘Emptiness’, offering a rare moment of space and tranquility.</p>\n<p>Alongside his assorted production projects, it’s easy to forgot Carbone is also involved in the running of several well-loved electronic labels, such as 3TH, Repitch and Cosmo Rhythmatic, presumably making his time all the more valuable. With ‘Melancholia’s release on Aboretum, it's good to see he's using those spare moments wisely.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/150733445?color=ffffff&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"309\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>&quot;Like a modern day folk musician, he's passing on the message of good ol' fashioned, proper House music through generations&quot; Bob Bhamra, the man behind the West Norwood Cassette Library label posits when talking of his latest release from James Duncan. 'Brooklyn Beats Vol. 1' covers four soulful House offerings with the grit left in - as Bhamra mentions, showing little regard for the gimmicks of 'revivalists'.</p>\n<p>As the title may suggest, Duncan has used New York as a very specific geographic marker point for the release. Each track is titled after a different Brooklyn subway stop - a fitting tribute to the city given the rather impressive stamp he has left on the NYC House scene. Since his debut in the late '90s, he has managed to contribute to some of the most influential Metro Area releases, as well as seeing collaborations with Morgan Geist and  releasing a long slew of 12&quot;s on esteemed labels such as Le Systeme and Real Soon.</p>\n<p>Aside from his rather lengthy history contributing to the city's dance music scene, it is interesting to note Duncan has also played trumpet with some of NYC's best jazz outfits. It is predominantly these experiences which he has decided to talk about for his contribution to our 'That Time When' series, from playing in Ornette Coleman's loft to sending Thurston Moore on a beer run...</p>\n<p>###1 Tom Bruno - NYC Subway_2000-2003</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1441/25448861965_6d97e84b03_b.jpg\" alt=\"a\"></p>\n<p>I've always been sort of fascinated by subways and subway systems, so it was cool when I moved to NY to discover that playing gigs in the subways had a long and storied tradition. I started getting calls from Free Jazz drummer (and downtown NY 'Legend' - and I don't use that term lightly) Tom Bruno to join him on trumpet for his subway gigs. Tom helped establish many of the playing locations with the MTA in '80s when city residents voted to officially allow musicians to play in the system, so he not only was an amazing player, but he was also able to secure some of the better locations to play. We always made great money and of course it was a major learning experience for me as he was one of my musical 'heroes'.</p>\n<p>###2 Ornette Coleman - NYC 2008-2010</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1559/25330451442_f9db0d86a9_b.jpg\" alt=\"v\"></p>\n<p>These really weren't 'gigs' per say, but they were amazing experiences nonetheless! I met Ornette literally on 7th Ave one day. A friend of mine knew him, so I was able to make some connections and he subsequently invited me to his loft to play, which was quite close. I ended up going two or three times. To say they were incredible experiences is an understatement. He also brought out his trumpet for me to check out. Since he was one of my fave trumpet players too, I was totally honored to look at it, check it out and chat about it.</p>\n<p>###3 Club Love/APT NYC 2001- 2005</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1681/24822150623_8f1b97fec9_b.jpg\" alt=\"e\"></p>\n<p>I DJ'ed at Club Love with Ulysses and Alexander Robotnick and then played trumpet live with Metro Area there. Anyone who ever went to Club Love will attest that it probably had one of the best sound systems ever created, so to play on it twice and on such great bills was amazing. It, along with APT, sort of represented this very 'transitional' time for clubs in NYC, for me at least. Long before RA 'discovered' NYC dance music 'again' but long after all the major clubs like Limelight etc had been shut down by the city, NYC nightlife sort of existed on this 'micro' level for a few years. I used to go check out Harvey upstairs at APT and we would just sit behind this small little DJ table and he would talk about surfing while blowing my mind playing records to literally about 30 people - none of whom knew who he was.</p>\n<p>###4 Thurston Moore - UMas 2002</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1562/24822236693_6a6cea2579_b.jpg\" alt=\"q\"></p>\n<p>I used to play in a free jazz collective in NYC called IZITITZ, which was lead by TEST bassist Matt Heyner. He and Chris Corsano knew Thurston Moore quite well, so we opened up for one of his free jazz gigs at UMass one night. Literally the day before this gig, he was quoted in the Village Voice making some somewhat 'disparaging' comments about The Rapture's 'House of Jealous Lovers' record, which felt like a bit of a 'cheap shot' at a bit of a 'low hanging fruit'. So I figured that he probably hadn't really listened to the whole 12&quot; - as here I was doing this sort of trumpet 'homage' to free jazz trumpeters Don Cherry and Raphe Malik on Morgan Geist's remix and him not really seeming to 'get it' - even though he sort of turned a lot of people onto Free Jazz via his infamous article in Grand Royal in the early '90s. So, instead of saying anything the next day at this gig, I simply kept my mouth shut and made him go on the beer run. That was sort of fun ha.</p>\n<p>###5 Random Bar Gig Ave A NYC 2001</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1448/25153357450_1a5ecf0bfb_z.jpg\" alt=\"w\"></p>\n<p>I actually don't remember what this bar was even called but I had gotten a regular Sunday night DJ gig there - which was usually a complete washout (ie: no one ever came)! So one Sunday night, as per usual, I finished early due to, wait for it... lack of people. So I had decided to have a quick beer at the bar before I left for home. As I sat there, these two women came in and were sort of worked up. Finally one of the said &quot;I can't believe about Joey!!&quot; Turns out they were discussing that Joey Ramone had just passed away. I was never a huge Ramones fan but liked them well enough and certainly understood they meant a lot to a great many people. Anyways, I just figured that they were talking as fans and probably didn't know him personally.</p>\n<p>Then one says &quot;Hey!! There's Lenny!&quot; and she runs out onto the street only to return with Patti Smith guitarist and East Village stalwart Lenny Kaye. So I continue to drink my beer while they all chat and before long we are pushing quarters into the bar's jukebox and here I am, doing shots and singing Ramones songs with Lenny Kaye, til long after closing. Later that week, when the Village Voice came out, Lenny had written <a href=\"http://www.villagevoice.com/news/joey-19512001-6395909\">a very touching, full page obituary to Joey Ramone</a> in it. He ended it by talking about how he was wandering around after hearing the news and ended up singing Ramones songs along with the jukebox, just how The Ramones should be enjoyed, one might say. A total 'New York Story' if there ever was one.</p>\n<p><em>'Brooklyn Beats Vol.1' will be available on the 18 March from the <a href=\"http://wnclrecordings.bandcamp.com/\">WNCL Webstore</a>.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/244584470&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>It’s almost become a cliché to ask what the next development in Drum &amp; Bass will be. With a history firmly rooted in dub-reggae soundsystems and 90’s rave culture, it’s tempting to think of it as inherently nostalgic in nature: a genre of collected memories and referential signposts. But that would be an unfortunate mistake because D&amp;B has always had a persistent fixation on the future. Specifically; afro-futurism, science fiction and state-of-the-art engineering have come to define its aesthetic. It’s therefore no surprise that D&amp;B continues to challenge our preconceptions of style and form, and the latest release from ILL_K and DYL is a shining example.</p>\n<p>The EP's central piece, ‘Neutron’, stitches together elements of dub, field recordings and cinematic sound design. At points, you can hear the trademark acceleration of an inevitable drop. But ILL_K breaks the excitement off without warning, leaving nothing but the swash of water and granular noise in its wake. The remix from Owl pushes this idea into yet more dizzying territory. It's like a patchwork assortment of the genre's hallmarks: the Reese bass, the clinically precise percussion, the brooding murmurs — laid out like a pack of tarot cards.</p>\n<p>The whole record is also mixed with a spindly, spider-like production. It feels alive, but in a creepy, undead kind of way: like a cold hand on the back of the neck. Indeed, I wouldn't be at all surprised if these producers were influenced by horror movies. The breath of forest winds and the metallic clang of blunt instruments echo in the distance, give the tense feeling that something might jump out at you any minute. DYL, who actually hails from Transylvania, even holds a Draculian demeanour in his press shots. But as Billy in 1996's <em>Scream</em> put it with extraordinary clarity: movies don't make psychos. Movies make psychos more creative.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/196190272&color=040404&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>All photos by Izzi Pettis.</em></p>\n<p>This year saw the very last edition of Bloc festival. Having begun in 2006, this was also their 10 year anniversary, and there have been many ups and downs along the way. The festival has slowly been forgiven for 2012's shutdown at Pontoon Docks after hosting a series of parties at Autumn Street Studios, and with the last few years of Bloc, lineups have been back at full strength. They also returned to their previous home, a Butlins resort in Minehead, which conversely seems ever the same, stuck in a bubble of garishly carpeted '90s nostalgia.</p>\n<p>The lineup included several old favourites such as Jeff Mills, Ben UFO and Omar S, as well as plenty of new faces including Thom Yorke, Nina Kraviz, Powell and err... Snooker champion Steve Davis. Having been criticized for the lack of women on the billing last year, Bloc decided to (partially) address the issue with a (partially) improved gender balance (88% men), as well as a panel discussion on gender on Saturday. Last year we suggested that Bloc remained a work in progress, and in this regard it seems they still have a way to go. Indeed, as far as Bloc goes, the future seems as changeable as ever. There are rumors the owners are pursuing a new venture: taking ownership of a venue deep in East London. So this year is perhaps best seen as a tipping point. The last in a run of what we formerly knew as Bloc, before another re-imagining.</p>\n<p>Rrose's loose-fitting soundscapes made a fitting introduction to the festival. Chugging motorik drums and dubbed-out ambience slowly morphed into billowing, smoky textures that enveloped the crowd like a welcoming hug. The polyrhythmic bleeps of Dasha Rush on the other hand, whipped the crowd into a unanimous motion. Needless to say, it doesn't take long to get a festival of 6000+ people in an appropriately enthusiastic state. Especially when you have people like DJ Skirt, or Trade (Blawan &amp; Surgeon) showcasing a network of languid handbreak riffs and sub-atomic low-end. Meanwhile, you have Tama Sumo and Lakuti providing some respite from the darker soundscapes with a series of rippling house reductions, drag queens dancing amongst the security on stage. Bloc is first and foremost a festival of fun.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1577/25226280584_5a3934c25e_b.jpg\" alt=\"crowd\"></p>\n<p>Perhaps one of the most novel and absurd aspects of Bloc has to be their DJ-in-the-pool idea. The water rapids that encircle the Waterworld venue function as a protective ring in which you are invited to regress into a state of youth. For better or worse, few places enable fully grown adults with jobs and families and world-weariness to reclaim their childhood by splashing around with rubber dingys and beach balls on magic mushrooms. But there is something very unreal about soundtracking a flume-ride with a fun-filled disco session from Space Dimension Controller, or a wave-machine with the drop-heavy electro of Egyptian Lover. Things like this shouldn't really be allowed, but I suppose that's what festivals are for.</p>\n<p>The holiday-home uncaniness of Butlins is probably best exemplified by the Pub stage, which looks like a second-grade road-side Wetherspoons. But some of the most interesting sets of the weekend were found here, like the analogue improvisations of Steevio and Suzybee. There was also a mind-bending performance from Andrea Parker. Shuffling half-step, broken-beat industrial and glitchy bass drops grew progressively wonkier as the set went on, culminating in The Haxan Cloak's epiphanic remix of Akkord, and a Diesel engine hip-hop excursion from Dead Fader.</p>\n<p>Holly Herndon's sideways take on electronic music is always a welcome breath of fresh air. So it's a shame that her live shows are as overbaked and tawdry as they are: complete with embarassing interpretive dance and cringy motion graphics of fractal MacBooks flying around in cyberspace. 'Come say Hi!' the text read on the screen as Herndon left the stage. But this ought not to be taken too literally, as she later refused pictures with her fans. A robotic voice opened Thom Yorke's performance: 'Ladies and Gentlemen', it began; 'the economy is stupid'.  His 'Tomorrow's Modern Boxes' outfit adopted three Kraftwerk-style podiums, performing an array of electrified classics from his backcatalogue. 'The Clock' and 'Black Swan' from his 2006 album <em>The Eraser</em> were notable highlights. Watching Yorke shuffle from one side of the stage to the other across his performance, it's obvious that gigs like this have become second nature to him, enjoying the show just as much as any one of his adoring revellers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1566/25830590416_d5b67f4516_b.jpg\" alt=\"andrea\">\n<em>Andrea Parker</em></p>\n<p>Back at the Fact stage, Evian Christ was delivering a futuristic meta-analysis of dance music: jumping from trance to R&amp;B to footwork as accelerating strobe lights caused permanent eye damage to the audience. The zenith of the show and perhaps the entire festival was a gabba rendition of Beethoven's 'Ode to Joy'. Powell also delivered a crazed set of thunderous beat experiments and jack-lead basslines working together in organised chaos. Fans will know the hyperactive level of energy with which the Diagonal boss approaches his performances, and this had a contagious effect at Bloc.</p>\n<p>One thing was certainly clear about the opening two nights of Bloc: there was something amiss about the homogeneity of the material. As the festival progressed with every drudgerous kick drum, it began to feel like a big night out sprawling over an entire weekend rather than a celebration of musical diversity. Lucky then, to have the Metalheadz crew treating us to a masterclass in drum &amp; bass on the final night. It was here that the scragglers and wreckheads really came into their element. &quot;You're the true weekend warriors&quot; the MC spat over a fractured 170 set from Marcus Intalex. Jubei breathed yet more life into the crowd with his class of clinically engineered Techstep. The showcase culminated with Goldie taking to the decks for the festival's close, muscular jungle laying a full-throttle sonic-assault on the audience. The MC had the final say as he muttered something about the importance of D&amp;B at a festival so overpopulated with techno. But I'm not sure how many people heard him over the sound of their rapturous applause and the ringing in their ears.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>'SH', the latest release from Berlin-based Kyoka is full of kinks and twists. The release follows on two years from her stunningly creative <em>Is (Is Superpowered)</em> LP on Raster-Noton, and makes a noted sonic departure from this material.</p>\n<p>In previous works Kyoka has expressed an interest in Dada style singing when writing her tracks, improvising lyrics in a stream-of-consciousness before chopping, processing and rearranging these samples. The effect is to remove these improvisations from their original context even further. The titles included in this latest release give a nod to this linguistic freeness. Tracks like 'smash/hush' or 'susurrus' provide onomatopoeic representations of their constituent sounds.</p>\n<p>'Susurrus' opens the EP, clambering from the blackness like baby spiders tumbling from their nest. Ruptured static tones and groaning drones flare up intermittently, dull bleeps and plodding dub grounding the track. The former posses a similarly gritten, crawling aesthetic. Languid half-step drums and off-kilter snares are punctuated by Kyoka's quivering, vaporous soundscapes. As the track progresses these textures grow in strength and ferocity, rising to an earth-trembling climax.</p>\n<p>At times, 'SH' feels reminiscent of some of T++'s more stripped back experiments. Take 'shush' for example, bouncing between pressure-blasted snares and shuddering stamps of low-end. Kyoka uses oddball sonic artefacts and modem style interference to piece together melodies, bumping  thrusts of low-end driving the track forward endlessly. This trick is employed similarly skillfully across the skittish 'hovering'. Digitized chimes and tonal glitches provide an uncanny riff alongside Kyoka's gliding, metallic hi-end and bursts of low-end.</p>\n<p>The release makes up one of Kyoka's most raw, hollowed out records to date, removing her signature vocals and laying her beatific granular experiments bare. In this pursuit she has contributed one of her most typically Raster-Noton-esque records to date, and with great skill and precision too. This said, this doesn't come at the expense of losing the offbeat humour which characterised previous releases: retaining her stylistic quirks even while taking a reductionist approach to her work.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/244594664&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>I can think of few producers working today with the same dexterity as Derek Piotr. In equal parts sound-designer, singer and conceptual artist, Piotr never fails to confound expectations as he swiftly shifts between interests. Listening to his music may find you one moment lost in the clatter of gamelan percussion. Next, you could be skanking to an earthy dub, like a forgotten B-side of a Missy Elliot instrumental. In 2013, he released <em>Raj</em>, an album he described as an “attempt at making an all-out noise record”. As for his latest EP, <em>Shallows</em>, we see him jumping headfirst into the murky waters of drone.</p>\n<p>As <em>Shallows</em> opens, we are beckoned into a restless malaise. Discordant juxtapositions of tone counteract one another like one of Eliane Radigue’s epic meditations. At its peak, time-stretched garbles hiss out at you and the creepy tapping of wood gets uncomfortably close to the ears. Perhaps the most striking feature of this EP is the omission of his signature lead vocals. His singing style usually comprises harsh cut ups and brutal auto-tune that make for trippy and heady listening. But on <em>Shallows</em>, Piotr remains silent. Instead, the odd buzzes and chirps speak for themselves.</p>\n<p>On ‘Rivulet to Gulf’, Piotr shares a more gentle vision. Here, hushed whispers and soft murmurs surround the stereo-field, enclasping the listener in an airy cloud of ambience. It’s astonishing to think that this is the same musician that brought us last year’s <em>Bahar</em>. This was a colourful and vibrant record; full of life and zest. But <em>Shallows</em> feels hollowed out, barren. The artwork also takes a sharp departure. Gone are the sickly sweet yellows and images of Piotr holding fruit. Instead, we see a grey, barren sea and Piotr’s stare into an abyss. This is his existential record: his mortem opus.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, only one thing appears to be constant for Piotr: change. It’s therefore tempting to reach for a hackneyed ‘chameleon’ analogy to describe Piotr’s instinct for reinvention. Like Bowie, his continued shape-shifting has become the defining characteristic of his work. But as Bowie often pointed out, chameleons merely blend in to their surroundings. The trick, rather, is to have an incongruous impact with each transformation. Perhaps a better analogy for Piotr would therefore be a hermit crab: endlessly outgrowing shells and seeking new ones. With every upgrade, a new dimension of his character can be seen.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3002249685/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://sciotorecords.bandcamp.com/album/shallows-single\">Shallows (Single) by Derek Piotr</a></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>By the sounds of it, you might not recognise the productions of Simon Unwin, aka Hence Therefore, from one project to the next. In a dusty pub near Liverpool Street earlier this year he mused on writing the soundtrack to a queer production of Shakespeare’s Hamlet, exploring the world of pop music under the name Simon Unwound and playing in a Fugazi inspired rock group with 3BS Records founder Jon Papert. “I put an ad in the street press” he begins when asked to expand on the latter. “I think it was something like ‘we need a drummer, we like Fugazi’ kind of thing... That was back in 2009. So we've known each other since then and been really good mates ever since. We lived together for a few years too. I guess I had listened to some electronic music before we started living together but he got really deeply into it. About the time I met Jon I was interested in trying to make electronic music and I started messing around with keyboards and stuff. That was like 6-7 years ago: it's only now got to a point where I feel like I'm any good at it.”</p>\n<p>His recent cassette, 'Machine For Destroying Value' saw its release through Papert’s 3BS, presenting a tapestry of faded percussive loops, gritten synth work and mournful ambience. Although the material may sound painstakingly arranged, according to Unwin, much of the release stems from live recordings. “I have no patience for software” he begins. “I just get so dizzy you know? I could do literally anything with this and it's too much! About half the EP is live. I have a Korg Poly 800. My brother's a teacher and he found it at his school. It was going to be thrown out so he gave it to me. I use that sometimes, but I'm trying to stick to just using vocals for Hence Therefore because I love singing and it's much more expressive. If you're running it through all this hardware too you can really explore where the human voice starts to sound inhuman. Where does it turn into a percussive instrument, or where does it start to sound creepy? That sort of uncanny valley of the human voice is rich.” <br/>\n <br/>\nAside from the EP’s mature tonal palette, Unwin has also been at pains to present a release which expresses something reflective of his own experiences and politics. “The EP is about the way that capitalism makes particular places or environments feel really nightmarish and strange”, he divulges when asked to explain the EPs context further. “The title, ‘Machine for Destroying Value’ is a quote from a Francis Spufford book about the Soviet Union called Red Plenty. I asked my friend Lizzie to do the cover art, which is of a giant coal mining machine in Germany I think. I guess the irony is here's this machine that's mining a very commercially profitable commodity but its actually destroying something else which is more valuable. If it's about anything its about that: that idea of being alienated by capitalism.</p>\n<p>“In Sydney in the Autumn it just rains all the time. A bunch of the buses in Sydney have got these huge ads on them. They're printed in this sort of gauzy way so you can ostensibly  see out the window still, but when it’s raining heavily, the effect is that you basically can't see out the window. You can't see where you are. This confluence of being on public transport in the rain with a privately rented ad on the side so you can't see where the fuck you are. These vague sort of anxieties are what it's about. I'm sure there'd be a myriad more examples in London, you're so close to the financial heart. People write about it and it’s real, I can tell that from a week here.”</p>\n<p>Unwin’s mix for us comprises the 60th in the series, and as such Unwin has provided something different from the usual format. His contribution comes in the form of a 25 minutes live set, showcasing his texturally rich, organic take on leftfield electronica, clamorous rhythms and swelling vocal abstractions building to a resonant close.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0060-hence-therefore%2F&hide_artwork=1\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Manuel Miethe</em></p>\n<p>The uneasy shuffle that opens the new album from Guido Möbius reminds me of two things. My immediate association is with the heavily processed noise-guitar style of Krautrock. A genre that could exist only with the aid of dozens of guitar pedals. But it could also be the furious tremor from Steve Reich’s <em>Different Trains</em>: the mechanical determination of each staccato stab accelerate the music into full speed. The angular voice of Cambodian singer Prak Chum adds another layer of turmoil, and the cacophony of percussion pushes it into overdrive. <em>Batagur Baska</em> takes its name from the scientific classification of a genus of endangered turtles, found in Southeast Asia. A name that is perhaps befitting, as this is an album teeming with life and has a vitality that is rarely found.</p>\n<p>The interplay of opposites is this album's central motif, and not an easy one to pull off. On ‘Windsurfing Chile’, the dry blow of a child’s recorder presents itself side-by-side with chromatic Jazz guitar and free-form scat. On ‘Rowno Malin Ternopol’, acid synths weave around traditional plucked string instruments. This is a playful record: an album buzzing with excitement and joyful experimentation as Möbius darts from one style to another. Indeed, there are few moments on <em>Batagur</em> that seem to make coherent sense. But don't let its seeming incongruence fool you. Instead, the trick is to step back and let it wash over you in all its cheerful chaos.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/151448762?color=050505&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"321\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>In 1972, Ingo Rechenberg applied methods of evolutionary biology and Darwinism to algorithmic programming, spawning theories of ‘artificial evolution’ and ‘evolutionary computation’. These algorithms mimic the natural world; reproducing, mutating, selecting and recombining data. Such methods were successful in solving difficult technical problems, such as the aerodynamics of wing design. In 1983, an artificial intelligence programme generated <em>The Policeman’s Beard is Half Constructed</em>, a text cautiously hailed as the first book of poetry ever written by a computer. In one part, it seems to suggest a startling sentience, as it writes:</p>\n<p><em>More than iron, more than lead, more than gold I need electricity.\nI need it more than I need lamb or pork or lettuce or cucumber.\nI need it for my dreams.</em></p>\n<p>And In 2014, a Java-based AI program entitled <em>Evolution</em> continuously reconfigured the poetry of Johannes Heldén, with the aim of passing the illustrious Turing test. This leaves important questions; what is the difference between author and programmer? Is such a distinction even meaningful? AGF’s poetry and music has continually revisited these problems, and her latest album — pronounced ‘contribution to evolution’ — is no different.</p>\n<p>Here, there are sonic moves towards that most futuristic genre of our decade; grime. On ‘greim69’, sound effects and fragments of digitally-processed noise dart across the stereo-field. There is also the welcome reappearance of sister-track ‘greim93’, and ‘time {if 1+2 = you}’, the lead single from her 2015 EP: <em>&gt;if * true ~ time [ x ] 1 + 2 = you . \\ &lt;</em>. For AGF, these algorithmic cut-ups of sound and poetry give us a way of understanding our current situation. As Burroughs once put it with remarkable precision: “when you cut into the present, the future leaks out”.</p>\n<p>For anyone looking to decipher this album’s cryptic message, there comes a helpful poem to tease out and elucidate some of the record’s central themes. This includes lines on ‘the mathematics of emotions’, ‘non-human spaces’ and ‘our potential to become cyborgs’. The last of these is most pertinent. As we export more of our creativity into automated technology, we are being steadily replaced. But for AGF this is no reason to despair. As she sings on the album, “we are vast and limitless”.</p>\n<p>Throughout, the sociopolitical context of her work is, as ever, at its forefront. Whether that is a dedication to Edward Snowden, or a spliced monologue from radical feminist thinker Angela Dimitrakaki, on ‘capita-lis-monster’. At one point, she states; “capitalism at present I would say produces all positions, even the opposition to itself. It can’t exist without the opposition to itself because it needs the task of transcending, it needs the struggle, it feeds it.” There is also a contribution from Kubra Khademi, an Afghani performance artist who walked through Kabul in steel armour to protest harassment. AGF has also hinted that this may be the final CD she will ever press, because, as she writes, “digital times are seriously coming…”</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2717932456/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://agf-poemproducer.bandcamp.com/album/kon-3p-ution-to-e-vol-ution\">Kon:3p>UTION to: e[VOL]ution by AGF</a></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Manni Dee’s contribution to techno has been a strong one. His presence is felt through a litany of EPs, each more complex and subtle than the last. It is perhaps best defined by staggeringly precise production and titanic dynamic shifts. It is also unapologetically bold: overdrive and metallic percussion battle one another in deafening cacophonies. But yet you can find his work through a diverse collection of labels from 2nd Drop to Black Sun to Leyla.</p>\n<p>Another, less well known side of his work operates under his Nuances moniker. Here, Manni takes a more introspective approach, teasing out intimate and delicate ambient recordings. In this sense, the two projects almost couldn’t be more dissimilar. His techno EPs are tough and striking, designed to fill clubs and shift bodies. Nuances by contrast is inward looking and meditative. And yet listening to these two projects side by side, there appears to be an indescribable continuity between them. A conceptual underpinning that manifests in two very different ways. Ahead of his performance at Electrowerkz this weekend, we caught up Manni Dee to talk about these two projects, as well as Iggy Pop, Sartre and the New Romantics.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/170918204&color=0b0b0b&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>So you grew up in Wolverhampton, what was the music scene like there when you were growing up? Were there any clubs around?  </strong></p>\n<p>Pretty much non-existent, the music scene was relatively silent. No clubs, only Yates'.</p>\n<p><strong>I nearly got head-butted in the Brighton Yates once. This guy was really pissed and thought I was laughing at him, but he was too drunk and missed me completely.</strong></p>\n<p>I saw two Arsenal fans fighting the other day outside Islington Mill. It was such a huge contrast between seeing William Basinski in a church with these awe-inspiring lights and walking by a couple of drunk football fans having a scuffle on the ground.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think of Basinski’s live shows? I remember seeing him at St. John Hackney playing <em>Nocturnes</em>, and people were whooping and cheering at the end… it’s not really the kind of emotional response I usually associate with William Basinski. It was as if he had just played ‘Back in Black’ or something.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah I guess there’s not much of a ‘performance’ going on but I forgive that because the experience of the shows are so beautiful… I also like how he dresses like Iggy Pop. There was this drunk guy next to us who fell asleep on my friend’s shoulder about three times. As we were leaving the venue we heard him say to his friends, “oh yeah it was a really transcendent experience”.</p>\n<p><strong>What about your own ambient project, Nuances? I understand you have a new release out?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah I have a <a href=\"http://totalblack.bandcamp.com/album/art-the-ego\">new ambient cassette out on Total Black</a>, which is this Berlin label that just put out some of Shifted’s ambient work. The turnaround was crazy, it got signed on Monday and was out by Thursday.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you come up with the titles for the first ambient cassette you did on Bastakiya Tapes? What is your thinking behind the project?</strong></p>\n<p>That’s a bit of a secret… But that project, I only just realised, is about loss and things coming to an end. Whether that’s a relationship, or just life in general. I’ve been writing music under that alias for about three years now but I’ve only just realised that for the most part the music is about destruction, and acknowledging and coping with the inevitable end of things.</p>\n<p><strong>Is that why you have press shots with fruit?</strong></p>\n<p>(Laughs) yeah, it’s all about the degradation of food. I never get round to doing press shots, I kind of hate them. I want to recontextualise what a press shot can be anyway. With that project, the press shots are a kind of extension of the music. Techno press shots are just so dull. I could have been on that DJs looking sad Tumblr way too many times in the past.</p>\n<p><strong>I guess it often seems appropriate if you’re making dark music to have a photo of you looking miserable. For some people it really works. Ontal’s drab press shots fit the mould, but having Ben UFO in greyscale in a carpark looks a bit ridiculous because he seems like quite an upbeat guy.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah Ontal’s visual aesthetic fits the aural side of things. They’re amazing, it’s always good to have their material to play out.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c7.staticflickr.com/2/1470/25960453990_b1ca8d99e3_b.jpg\" alt=\"manni\"></p>\n<p><strong>I remember when you did your Nuances show on Radar, it was like a semi-improvised live show. Is that how you write the material for the cassettes as well?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah a lot of them are; the live sets are just an extension of how those tracks are composed. But it’s completely improvised. I do a bit of sound-prep beforehand and then just chuck it all in. It feels so intuitive, it’s like reaching inside yourself and throwing something onto the canvas and it’s done. It’s more cathartic in a sense, more personal. You don’t have to procure it or fine tune in any way. That’s what I love about the project: it’s not catered for anything in particular.</p>\n<p><strong>In terms of process, how do the two project differ?</strong></p>\n<p>Both my Manni Dee and Nuances projects stem from a fascination of sound but they manifest in completely different ways. I think the techno stuff is more about energy, and what the sounds are doing and how they communicate. I’m really interested in the autonomy of sound. Sometimes you can take the passenger seat and the sound will just drive you along, even though your intentions are totally different. You can begin with a kick drum and it can somehow turn into a synth line or something, you just have to let go of the reins once in a while.</p>\n<p><strong>Is it weird playing the ambient stuff live?   </strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, there's rarely a visual gauge in regards to the audience's reaction to it. There’s no inappropriate cheering and whooping like there was at William Basinski. I’m really interested in seeing how you can push a crowd when playing live. I remember Surgeon once said to me that he likes to get a crowd to a certain place sonically and then see how long he can keep them there for.</p>\n<p><strong> I’m a big fan of your 'Habits of Hate' project with Happa. Do you like collaborating?</strong></p>\n<p>I prefer working alone. Me and Happa both work in a very alone-kind-of-way. Probably because we both have a very specific way of working. And it’s such a personal thing making music. I make music for ‘that moment’. Some people call it the flow state. It’s so blissful, it’s not like any other kind of bliss.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/137788623&color=000000&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Tell us about this upcoming Loose Lips show on April 8th, who else is playing?   </strong></p>\n<p>Florian Kupfer, Nick Dunton, Chloe Frieda from NTS (really looking forward to her set.) I really love Electrowerkz as a venue. It has such a rich history in Industrial music, you still get those Industrial heads going and there seems to be almost no pretence around the venue. It reminds me of a throwback to a New Romantic period, where going out wasn’t just something that flippantly occurs on the weekend, it was something that people got dressed up for and looked forward to all week. It was clubbing as a kind of escapism.</p>\n<p><strong>You have an EP entitled ‘Being &amp; Nothingness’, is Sartre an influence for you?  </strong></p>\n<p>Yeah I would definitely say I’m an existentialist. I think it’s the way I naturally feel but then I just found a name and a philosophy for it. I believe that stagnation is the enemy of the existentialist. As soon as I’m done writing one thing, I’m on to the next. One of the hardest things for me being a producer is listening back to masters. It’s almost like visiting an ex-girlfriend and seeing that they’re doing really well (laughs). I’ve spent so much time with those sounds and now I have to sit and listen to them three months after I’ve had closure on them.</p>\n<p>But I think of my music as like a feedback loop; my life, what I read, my philosophy. I know a lot of producers think of making bangers as separate but it isn’t for me. It’s one and the same. Having a reference to a book like that might seem obscure for someone on the outside, but for me, it’s not. It’s very much infused in the music. I can see how someone would think of that as pretentious, but people must remember that music is art, and there's always licence for pretence in art.</p>\n<p><strong>There seems to be an attitude at the moment that dance music isn’t allowed to be serious or too meaningful, but clubbing can hold some really formative experiences.</strong></p>\n<p>I always think about how clubs bring communities together — when I go clubbing, I spend about 70% of my time in the smoking area talking to people that I love about music. In such a chaotic city, it’s so important to have somewhere to retreat to.</p>\n<p><em>You can catch Manni Dee at the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/805151109630839/\">Loose Lips showcase on April 8th at Electrowerkz</a>.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/245719327&color=040404&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

While keeping the label very much a French affair, they became notable for picking up talent early, releasing work from now Modern Love signed Low Jack and Perc Trax signee Mondkopf. One artist who has stuck with In Paradisum right from the early stages, is Paris based Charlie Janiaut aka Qoso. Such are his ties with the imprint Janiaut even saw his debut release on In Paradisum head Guillaume Heuguet's first label, Fools House. Speaking of his relationship with the imprint, Janiaut  seems relaxed. &quot;I've known the In Paradisum guys for a long time&quot; he begins. &quot;They are friends and know what interests me in art, music… and food. There's a kind of freedom, I've designed the cover of the LP for example. It's important to me to work on the whole 'package' (music and visuals) and invite some friends to collaborate too, as we I did with the videos for the LP.&quot;</p>\n<p>The LP Janiaut mentions is his debut album release, <em>Printemps-Ete</em>, which translates as Spring-Summer. The album was apparently created in &quot;one shot&quot; across last summer, the title derived from his interest in fashion. &quot;I work for magazines and read/watch a lot of things about fashion&quot; he responds when asked on the title's English translation. &quot;The title refers simply to a fashion collection… and the fact it's coming out for spring! A former title was 'Automne-Hiver'. I like that contrast between what you expect when reading the title and then listening to the music.&quot;</p>\n<p>The album covers a frenetic mix of distorted breaks, booming 4/4 and otherwise mangled electronics. The album is supposedly constructed from samples in it's entirety - an impressive feat if true, especially considering the complexity of some of Janiaut's beatless motions. His prowess when it comes to sample manipulations might be best explained knowing he began his exploration into production with French hip-hop crew Butter Beats. &quot;We are friends too&quot; he starts when asked on his relationship with them. &quot;I learnt to produce hip hop beats on Reason and Ableton with them. Sid (the rapper) helped me on my firsts techno tracks. I like the way they work, because they don't care what samples they use in their music; from '80s pop to Aphex Twin or Horror OSTs. I grew up listening to rap music on the radio and in skate videos. My introduction to electronic music was with turntablism, and the breakbeats we used for DJ battles.&quot;</p>\n<p>Janiaut's mix for us features some of the French rap mentioned, as well as an equally diverse selection of techno, industrial and footwork style selections. &quot;I think it represents the way I'm listening to music, I like contrasts and surprises. I'm not into playing it sleek&quot; he states when asked on the thinking behind the mix, before leaving us with a question of his own: &quot;Why should we dance only on one BPM for two hours?&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist</strong></p>\n<p>Esplendor Geometrico - Muerte A La Scala Industrial [Linea Alternativa] <br/>\nDJ Slugo - Telegraph It [Dance Mania] <br/>\nRussell Haswell - Hardwax Flashback [Diagonal] <br/>\nCliché - Machine 3180 [Signum] <br/>\nQoso - Strass &amp; Paillettes [In Paradisum] <br/>\nDJ Nigga Fox - Weed [Príncipe] <br/>\nHead Front Panel - Untitled [Head Front Panel] <br/>\nHieroglyphic Being - Liquid Sex [Spectral Sound] <br/>\nDJ Slugo - That's It [Dance Mania] <br/>\nUnit Moebius - Sewer [Interr-Ference Communications] <br/>\nCristian Vogel - Comes [Unknown] <br/>\nSurgeon - Boxy [Unknown] <br/>\nCut Hands - Festival Of The Dead [Blackest Ever Black] <br/>\nDJ Katapila - Ice Inc [Awesome Tapes From Africa] <br/>\nThe Mole People - Ocean [Strictly Rhythm] <br/>\nLa Fouine, Mala - Boum Boum Boum [Unknown] <br/>\nCristian Vogel - Mad Sex [Tresor] <br/>\nDJ Rush - Contour [Dance Trippin] <br/>\nDJ Rashad - Gucci Mane - Bitch I Might Be (Juke Jams Remix) [Unknown] <br/>\nLa Peste - Le Syndrome Des Draps Cassants [Hangars Liquides] <br/>\nKoopsta Knicca - Inside Of [Unknown] <br/></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0061-qoso%2F&light=1\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>I remember the first release I heard of Herve Atsè Corti aka Herva's. Released on esteemed dutch label Delsin, 2013's 'What I Feel' EP jolted between glitch-laced house, woozy electro-psychedelia and raw, machine-driven techno. Despite the diverse tonal pallette, Corti's unique blend of sampling and gritten electronics tied the release together remarkably well - as if taking snapshots of different landscapes through the same, uniquely filtered lens.</p>\n<p>Three years on and Corti has seen releases on All City, Don't Be Afraid and Kontra, as well as having fulfilled one of his lifelong dreams, releasing an LP on Mike Paradinas' Planet Mu. Despite the now enviable back-catalogue of releases, the same theme seems to define Corti's work for me - using a wide array of distinctive processing to recontextualise all manner of samples to his own unique tonal pallette. This isn't to say there has been no progression however. His Planet Mu LP <em>Kila</em> felt considerably rougher around the edges than previous releases, distorted flourishes deepening the album's immersive qualities even further. This is perhaps a byproduct of Corti's new field of study, Electronic Engineering, which has even seen him able to fine-tune his studio with even greater proficiency.</p>\n<p>Aside from his solo work, Corti is also a member of several collaborative projects, such as Bosconi Records mainstay Life's Track, and avante-garde collective Tru West. With more material due out from Tru West shortly, as well as an upcoming show alongside Shackleton with Florence's Disco_nnect promoters, we decided to catch up with Corti to see how he's keeping up with it all.</p>\n<p><strong>You mentioned you're studying Electrical Engineering at the moment, how are you finding it? When did you first get interested in electronics?</strong></p>\n<p>The degree is tough! I had an exam last week and I'm still waiting for the results. I should graduate this year anyway. It's quite hard because the DJ lifestyle is not the best thing for engineering! I guess I started messing around with stuff a couple of years ago. I was studying mechanical engineering - and to be honest it wasn't my jam. I was into mechanical engineering because I loved motorbikes.</p>\n<p>I've been making music for almost 13 years and at some point I decided it was stupid to carry on with mechanical engineering when it has no connection with music. It was a decision I made without having to think about it too much. I decided to take electronic engineering because I wanted to get deeper into what I was doing - I started trying to better understand the machines I was using.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/185703120&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>And you're studying in your hometown of Florence right?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah - I'm not from the centre of the city but just outside.</p>\n<p><strong>I wanted to ask about the nightlife in the city. I interviewed another Italian artist a while back who used to talk about parties up in the woods in Trento near Lake Garda (I guess what we'd call 'free parties' in the UK), is this something that happens in Tuscany too?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, these kind of parties happen but they're really rare. It's difficult because Florence isn't a very big city - there aren't many locations for that kind of thing. If you do something illegal the police might show up, so people don't do it too much, but sometimes there's some really cool stuff. You do a one off party then change your location. It's a new story every time. The guys at Killabros made some really great parties, but even for the legal parties there aren't many locations in Florence. I guess the city doesn't like electronic music too much so there aren't many places we can do our stuff.</p>\n<p>There's only one big club in Florence, but there are also a lot of small promoters that do really cool things. This is important because these are the people that keep the city alive. If you have just one club, you're fucked! You just listen to what they want you to so it's not good.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the decent smaller parties you'd recommend?</strong></p>\n<p>Well firstly the Disco_nnect stuff. It's quite an obvious choice though because I'm a resident DJ at the night. It's also an easy choice because they have a really good cypher of events. Next week I will play with Shackleton. They do some really really cool stuff - from noise music to dance and electronic house. The next event will be William Basinski. They are interested in small stuff - not too much PR and communication.  They do it for the music and that's all, and that's why I like working with them.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/218896088&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>And are people in Florence receptive to this stuff?</strong></p>\n<p>It's been trying to figure that out for years! It's a pretty a random distribution of people coming to different events, and a certain core that really dig them. You never know if people are there for drugs or girls or are there for no reason at all. Maybe people go just because it's popular for a bit, but I don't know if they are deeply into it. It shouldn't be important though.</p>\n<p>The point is that some people who come randomly, are impressed by what they see and become interested in electronic music - that's the important thing. It's not every day you can see William Basinski in Florence for example (laughs). If five or six people are impressed by what he's doing, it already enough because these five or six people will open their mind to this world and talk to other people. That's how it works. You have to approach this stuff in little steps. Promoters shouldn't need to worry about how many people come to these events, they should worry about what they want to share with the city, what they want to offer.</p>\n<p><strong>I read in another interview releasing on Rephlex was another dream of yours alongside Planet Mu... Do you remember the first Aphex you heard?</strong></p>\n<p>I heard Aphex and Autechre's stuff when I was about 15 or 16. That day changed my life because those guys do so much with electronic music - they opened up my mind. My stuff is on the weirder end of the spectrum - it's not easy listening stuff. All my years I've been listening to Rephlex, Planet Mu and Warp.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1601/25652790704_b6e816d0bd_z.jpg\" alt=\"lifestrack\"></p>\n<p><em>Life's Track - Herva &amp; Dukwa</em></p>\n<p><strong>After working on a big project like <em>Kila</em> or <em>Instant Broadcast</em> do you have a break in writing or is it continuous?</strong></p>\n<p>It's random. After <em>Kila</em> I took five or six months, where I'd do one track or so and not much more. When I finished <em>Kila</em> I was gigging a bit more so I had some money to invest in the studio and I decided to change it a lot. It took a long time because I had to think about a new system for my studio. I took five months to work on it; buying new gear and fixing stuff. I did a bit of maintenance; upgrading and changing, also building up new gear... I wanted a new environment before starting new music.</p>\n<p>I only go in the studio when I want to though. It doesn't make any sense to treat it like a job. Maybe you'll keep on doing the same stuff, but for me it's important to keep challenging myself. I don't care if it's better or worse, I just want to be excited by what I'm doing at the moment. It's important to me to have new ideas. Maybe if I didn't make music but thought about instead - it'd be cool because it's the same thing to me. You are always making music because you are focused on making music - that's the point. You don't have to be in the studio every day because if you do, for me, if I force myself to go every day i'll just come up with the same sounds and that would be annoying.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/85017172&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>And you change your studio around quite a bit?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, it's like a spaceship now! Really. I don't like to talk about my studio too much, people should care about the music and not how I make it, but this time it's quite sick! I'm a jealous guy and it's like if I were to let you see my girlfriend naked or something, it's not possible! (laughs)</p>\n<p><strong>I was a big fan of the Kontra EP you did with Mass Prod (Martino Marini) a few years back. Do you remember the first time you met?</strong></p>\n<p>I don't really remember when we first met because it was a long time ago - we're good mates! I'll see him next week as he's in Florence. I met him six or seven years ago because at that time Dukwa (who I share the Lifes Track project with) was sending stuff to Mass Prod, and he was sending his stuff to Fabio Della Torre at Bosconi Records. That's how we all became friends, because Fabio was getting interested in Dukwa's music and after that my music, and Mass Prod was part of the Bosconi crew too. It's just because we all share the same label and we're all Italians.</p>\n<p>For a period Mass Prod also lived in Florence so we used to hang together, but the Kontra thing came about because I was in Berlin in that period. Mass Prod was living there for a couple of years and he had a really big and cool studio. We decided to try making something together and the record came up. There's not too much planning in what we're doing! I think I had a gig in Berlin. I didn't used to travel very much so when I do it's nice to take some extra days!</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/221117928&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>It all comes together quite naturally by the sounds of it...</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, you know, you're there with a friend, he has a cool studio, why not make some stuff together! Maybe now I don't make random stuff so much. In that period I was much more focused on <em>just</em> making music, where as now I give a big part of my life to electronic engineering, to my girlfriend, my friends - I used to take it a lot easier. If I don't have as much time to go to the studio because of exams and stuff - when I do I like to have the time to do my stuff freely.</p>\n<p>If you keep on starting projects with people that maybe don't for example live in your city - it's quite hard to keep up the work because you have to take your time to maybe talk on Skype, you have to share projects, you have to figure stuff out - it takes time. With the Mass Prod release I had three days with nothing to do so I could go to the studio. Now I'm in Florence and I have to study for my exams. I might not have enough time to even go to a record shop perhaps.</p>\n<p><strong>Will we see more from the Tru West project too? What's next for yourself more generally?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah of course, we have a new release coming soon. It is a really open collective. It's me, Mass Prod, Rufus Raffalmenta and Matteo the label boss of Marmo music (we call him Medium as it's thanks to him the whole project started). I have remixed one of the tracks on the new release and I really love that remix.</p>\n<p>I also have another release for Rufus on Bosconi Records. After that I will do some work with All City and Planet Mu, but it's just now I'm figuring out how I'm going to make the music. All this stuff will come after the summer. I know that we will do something else but I'm also interested just to do some new music because the new studio is sick and I got some weird new stuff, so I want to make as much new music as possible and then see what gets released after.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/234930830&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>I have seen few live shows so violent as those from Puce Mary. During her performance at Berlin Atonal last year, she lurched from one side of the stage to the other, screeching indiscernible phrases that built to a deafening climax, leaving the audience stunned and bewildered. Yet while her stage shows have left an unmistakable mark on all those that have laid witness, Puce Mary is far from just a live act. She has released on a number of different labels, from Berlin based (predominantly) cassette label Total Black to (exclusively) cassette label Nordisk Klub. Lately however, she seems to have found the best home for her claustrophobic doom-noise on Copenhagen based Posh Isolation. If the name sounds familiar, the imprint graduated from short-run tapes with everything from vinyl to written works and art exhibits. By the looks of their Facebook, the label are now even selling t-shirts and condoms.</p>\n<p>This is therefore a befitting home for Puce Mary, since her music is highly pre-occupied with our most basic of human functions. Orgasms, flesh, piss, bodies, fear and pleasure all feature as central themes in her music. This fixation with the physical is shared with much of the power electronics scenes of the '80s and '90s. Like Whitehouse and Prurient, Puce Mary's distorted frequencies seem to clamber inside of one's ear and into the body.\nAt times, the invasive intimacy on <em>The Spiral</em> reaches unbearable levels, like her softly spoken voiceover on ‘Enter Into Them’: “…the skin will start softening and coming off / they will frantically scratch their faces and peel themselves like oranges…”</p>\n<p>The album also has a repressed energy to it, with bursts of noise jumping out at unsuspecting moments. Across 'The Temptation To Exist', sickly metallic textures grind against the most fragile of rhythmic backdrops: like an old film reel struggling to play at a consistent speed. On 'Masks Are Aids II', knotted drones and clattering drums falter beneath Puce Mary's ultra-sonic tones.</p>\n<p>I have often wondered if power electronics will or can ever make a ‘comeback’. The idea itself is somewhat bizarre since the genre has never really been fully naturalised into mainstream appreciation, and perhaps never will. Indeed, Puce Mary seems decidedly resilient to assimilation of any kind. Ear-splitting frequencies, harsh visual imagery and violent live shows have made her enigmatic and triumphantly abstruse.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/208295022&color=000000&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p>Founded in 1958, the BBC Radiophonic Workshop has left a legacy difficult to rival. A year prior to its establishment, composer and sound engineer Desmond Briscoe had worked alongside Daphne Oram - another composer and later creator of the 'Oramics' machine - on a number of radio plays. These included Samuel Beckett's <em>All That Fall</em> and  Frederick Bradnum's <em>Private Dreams and Public Nightmares</em>.</p>\n<p>Such was the public interest in the so called 'radiophonic' sounds Briscoe and Oram created for these plays, the workshop was established by the BBC with the expressed interest of creating both new music and sound effects for radio. By the time it's legacy was complete however, the Radiophonic Workshop had exceeded these goals tenfold, tagging, either directly or indirectly, some of the most notable advancements in British electronic music.</p>\n<p>Many of these developments would relate to a movement that had been initiated earlier in Paris, with the advent of 'Musique Concrète'. Oram in particular would explore the possibilities of tape manipulation, looking to new techniques to create the strange, haunting and otherworldly sounds the Radiophonic Workshop became best known for. Conventional recordings would be spliced, reversed, stretched and otherwise processed in any way possible.</p>\n<p>One of the most famous uses of this technique came in 1963 from a woman named Delia Derbyshire. Derbyshire was born into a working class family in Coventry in 1937, and went on to study music at Cambridge before joining the BBC in 1960 (not before being turned away by Decca Records in 1959 on the grounds that they did not employ women). After working for the corporation as an assistant studio manager for two years, she was assigned to the Radiophonic Workshop, where she would work on an electronic realisation of Roy Grainer’s Dr Who theme. Alongside the now iconic soundtrack, Derbyshire would also help devise sound effects for the programme, for example using manipulated recordings of a set of keys and a broken piano to create the sound of the Tardis travelling through space.</p>\n<p>Despite the impact of her work, the BBC never credited Delia for her contributions to Doctor Who, nor was she ever issued with royalties for her role in creating the soundtrack and related effects. Derbyshire left the Workshop in 1973, in her own words, in the interest of &quot;self-preservation&quot;.</p>\n<p>The Radiophonic Workshop closed in 1998 as it was failing to generate enough revenue, however 2012 saw its revival as an online entity, fronted by Matthew Herbert and supported by both The Arts Council and the BBC. To celebrate its legacy, we decided to take a deeper look at three of the Radiophonic Workshop's most influential members.</p>\n<p>###Daphne Oram // Founding Studio Manager</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1707/25909509633_2f393b2a49.jpg\" alt=\"oram2\"></p>\n<p>Despite being the individual that all Radiophonic Workshop roads lead to, very little music from Daphne Oram actually exists. She began as a Music Balancer for the BBC in 1943, and quickly became interested in producing electronic music that used pre-recorded instruments and the radio equipment from the BBC studio. After the successful commission work for Beckett, the British public became ravenous for her novelty electronics and thus, the BBC opened the Radiophonic Workshop, with Oram at its helm. Here, Oram played endlessly with sound; splicing tape and modifying technology to create music which was wholly novel at the time. Yet, within less than a year of the workshop's opening, Oram had left, apparently unhappy with the lack of enthusiasm the BBC showed for her wild synthetic experiments.</p>\n<p>From here, Oram pursued her true creative calling: the development of the Oramics studio. The eponymous 'Oramics technique' created sound, not from electronic generators or instruments, but from drawing graphs onto 35mm film, modulating the signal given to the photocells. Surprisingly enough, this technique has a timeless quality to it, and the eery swells and washes that were produced by Oram in those early recordings continue to astonish. The only existing Oramics machine was briefly shown at The British Science Museum in the early 2010s, and was described by the museum's curator, Dr Tim Boon, as being &quot;as important for electronic music as the models of the Great Eastern Ship are to the history of maritime engineering.&quot;</p>\n<p>I think the few recordings that exist of Oram continue to hold our attention for two reasons. Firstly, the sheer technical prowess of Oram is enough to gawk at: tape manipulation and 'drawn-sound' are techniques that are still used and considered 'experimental' today, and yet Oram was there half a century before anyone else. But more than this, the music itself has an atmospheric pull like no other. Imagine a fastidious Oram locked away in her studio in the small hours, playing with synths and samples, and creating music that sounded like it was written for alien consumption only. There's also a humour to it that is often overlooked. She frequently cut-up and looped extracts from radio advertisements until they sounded absurd and meaningless: perhaps an early critique of the discomforting reality of consumer culture, but also perhaps not... Just listen to this proto-dub extract from 'Birds of Parallax' (on the <a href=\"http://daphneoram.bandcamp.com/album/oramics\"><em>Oramics</em> compilation</a>), and trace her influence all the way through Kraftwerk, Pink Floyd and Madlib.</p>\n<p><em>Words by George McVicar</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/197330239&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n___________________________________________________________<br>\n###Delia Derbyshire  // Studio Manager & Composer \n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1568/26415244922_427de9db47_b.jpg\" alt=\"derbyshire\"></p>\n<p>Perhaps the most famed member of the Radiophonic Workshop, Delia Derbyshire produced some of its most innovative and intriguing work, and has rightly earned the reputation as a key figure in introducing electronic music to popular culture.</p>\n<p>Arguably her finest work, was a series of radio plays that she produced in the mid sixties in collaboration with composer and playwright Barry Bermage. The series was entitled ‘Inventions for Radio’, and each of the four programmes interpreted a different theme – dreams, ageing, god, and the afterlife. Combining cut up narration and droning, pulsing electronics, the programmes eschew conventional linear narrative and attempt to represent the theme or topic at hand in terms of sensations and mood.</p>\n<p><em>Dreams</em> is the first and most unsettling entry in the series. Recordings of people recounting nightmares in which they have been chased, fallen, drowned, or encountered formless Lovecraftian horrors, are paired with dissonant electronics to disquieting effect. Appropriately enough, this recording soundtracked one of the most dream-like waking life experiences I have stumbled into: a surreal oneiric episode in a subterranean public toilet in Bristol. On a springtime visit to the city several years ago, I had been listening to <em>Dreams</em> on headphones as I perambulated around the city centre, and when I descended to an underground Victorian era bathroom to relieve myself, the waves of drones and cut-up voices narrating half-remembered nightmares had shifted my consciousness into a quasi-hypnagogic state. The bathroom was apparently empty, and so I kept the headphones on in the cubicle, happy not to have the presence of another person intrude on my reverie and jolt me back to the real world.</p>\n<p>After a couple of minutes I thought I heard a knocking on the wooden stall divider next to me, but thought nothing of it until a head suddenly appeared underneath the door in front of me. A man’s face with long unkempt hair and a straggly beard was staring up at me, not particularly threateningly, but given the situation whatever the facial expression was it was going to make me somewhat apprehensive. Still entranced by the recording, I didn’t react with shock and didn’t even think to take the headphones out, and moments later the head had gone. I sat there bemused for 30 seconds or so before the head reappeared. This time it tried talking to me, but unable to hear over the recording I stared back for a few seconds before swinging at it. The head swerved out the way and disappeared. When I left the cubicle a few minutes later there was no sign of anyone, and as I climbed back up the stairs and into the light, I was left wondering if it had really happened at all, or whether this unanticipated interloper had been just a fanciful creation of an over-stimulated imagination.</p>\n<p>What would have ordinarily been an unpleasant and alarming experience became an amusing, somnolent interlude, like a compelling bad trip. I was struck by how the mind needs only the slightest coaxing to break from mundane ordinary experience into something quite different, and this seemed a perfect endorsement of Derbyshire’s attempt to recreate dreams and remind us that every night we let go of conscious control and slip into an irrational world of our own making.</p>\n<p><em>Words by Rob Heath</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/5300331&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n___________________________________________________________<br>\n###Matthew Herbert // Creative Director, New Radiophonic Workshop \n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1709/26415245172_0ec2912d81_b.jpg\" alt=\"herbert\"></p>\n<p>Doctor Rockit, Transformer, Mumblin’ Jim, Wishmountain... Matthew Herbert has more aliases than you can shake a stick at. If you were to shake a stick at them though, Herbert would probably be there with a field recorder ready to sample the airy swooshing sounds and make a three hour concept album about it. It was a similar process he went through with 2013's <em>The End Of Silence</em>, where after being sent a five second recording of a bomb being dropped in Libya, Herbert set about using this to create an entire LP, raising issues about how we perceive war in the digital age.</p>\n<p><em>One Pig</em> similarly encouraged us to think about the farming industry after Herbert constructed an entire album using recordings on pig farms and abattoirs. Even earlier than this, Herbert's saw success was his Radio Boy project, in which he used all manner of sample sources to craft oddball sountracks to the dancefloor, kickdrums rattling like bones in a cardboard box. His 2000 album <em>The Mechanics Of Destruction</em> challenged rampant consumerism, given away for free and using samples of everyday disposable items - coke cans, newspapers, fag packets. The list goes on.</p>\n<p>I remember a few years ago being excited for an upcoming Boiler Room appearance he had. Would he be spinning the blissed-out house of his Herbert alias? Or maybe a live performance from one of his pop endeavours? Instead we were treated to an hour of Herbert exploring the British Library’s sound archives, discussing some of his favourite sound sources and processing methods. Given the bewilderingly detailed, almost encyclopaedic knowledge displayed in this, it seems fitting Herbert was appointed as Creative Director of the New Radiophonic Workshop in 2012, an Arts Council funded venture to revive the institution. It might not be quite as expansive a reopening as one would hope for, but I guess given the current political climate, that’s to be expected, and I can think of no one better to have at its helm.</p>\n<p><em>Words by Theo Darton-Moore</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/147243281&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>This weekend, Maria W Horn will be playing at the second installment of <a href=\"http://www.intonalfestival.com/\">Intonal</a>; a four-day festival curated by  Inkonst, Unsound, CTM, EMS and IAC. When I asked about her impending performance, she gave me full disclosure. &quot;You can expect synthetic doom, trashy distortion, processed machine-gun-stroboscope amplified with electromagnets and sci-fi Super 8 films.&quot; It came as no surprise then, that Horn describes herself as an 'audio-visual' producer, since her live set consists of drones and sound-design experiments accompanying live-manipulated film.</p>\n<p>But music and composition has always been her central focus, and this spring will see a purely musical release for her, out on Holodisc. 'Diverted Units' is a composition originally created for audio-visual consumption. As Horn tells me, &quot;[Diverted Units] has so far been presented and performed as an audiovisual piece, but the audio was composed prior to adding the visual component and I think it works well as a stand-alone musical piece. I'm curious about presenting the music on its own.&quot;</p>\n<p>In this sense, her meticulous approach to recorded music may seem somewhat at odds with her freeform visual work, but the two work together in tandem for Horn. &quot;During one period I felt some kind of prestige in not preparing my live sets, only doing free improvisation and live generated synthesis. After a while I realized that approach was most fun as a challenge for myself, I never felt particularly proud about the outcome. As a reaction to that method I started pre-composing parts of the audio for my performances.&quot; This in turn seems to have triggered her desire to improvise her visual performances. &quot;After a while I started feeling bored with just wiggling knobs on a mixing desk behind my laptop, so I wanted to contrast my live set with something visual, physical. Super-8 projectors, video feedback, light and optical objects became a great complement&quot;.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/40931575?color=ffffff&portrait=0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"288\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>Horn also has a distinct knack for collaboration, including involvement with the legendary <em>Fylkingen</em> art collective that began in the 1930s. &quot;When I first moved to Stockholm from my hometown, a small village in the north of Sweden, I heard that Fylkingen was a meeting place for people doing experimental music. I was terrified when I first visited the venue: everyone was dressed in black and that particular night they hosted a weird Fluxus performance. Since then, Fylkingen has become like a second home for me and during the last years it has been an amazing place to experiment and develop new material.&quot;</p>\n<p>She has also become involved with the nascent ‘Stockholm Drone Society’, a group that describe themselves as &quot;a group of composers with a shared interest in slowly evolving timbral music&quot;. The group is decidedly forward-thinking, and thus Horn ought to feel right at home within it. &quot;Since drone music is often rejected from standard concert programs and conflicts with how music is generally presented (mainly due to its occupation of time) we decided in 2013 to form a group organizing events premiering this extended format&quot;, she tells me. &quot;Since then we have, among other things, held 12-hour concerts in an underground nuclear reactor hall and all night showcases in an abandoned mine at Norberg Festival.&quot;</p>\n<p>Horn also shows no signs of stopping after Intonal, with many other projects on the horizon. &quot;I am looking forward to spending some time in my hometown Härnösand this summer, researching material for an upcoming electroacoustic piece about the shootings of Ådalen, a series of events in and around the sawmill district of Ådalen in may 1931. Last fall I initiated a project together with producer Sara Fors on the topic of Satanic Feminism. We are a group building a practice using satanism and sectarianism as political and artistic strategies. Some aspects of the work includes creating ceremonies, rituals and counter-readings of patriarchal texts.&quot; Ahead of her performance at <a href=\"http://www.intonalfestival.com/arists/\">Intonal</a>, listen below to Maria W Horn's contribution to our podcast series.</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist:</strong></p>\n<p>Aero intro - TMRW [Ambitious Tapes]<br>\nCastrati Stack - Tim Hecker [4AD]<br>\nScare Rotor - Maria w Horn - GhostPrint remix [Unreleased]<br>\nEphemeris - David Granström [Upcoming XKatedral Release]<br>\nBound Universe - Abul Mogard [Ecstatic]<br>\nQuick Botta - Punctum [Unreleased]<br>\nDeserted but not Uninhabited - Maria w Horn [Unreleased]<br>\nFM Keeps its promises - Daniel M Karlsson [Unreleased]<br>\nSilwex - Kali Malone [Oma333]<br>\nVanishing Membranes - Mats Erlandsson [Posh Isolation]<br>\nThe Voyage Out - Marie Davidsson [Total Black]<br>\nEvil Ball - Sinoia Caves [Brah Records]<br>\nV - Erik Enocksson [Release The Bats]<br>\nWrap around me - Waves of light [Unreleased]<br>\nLamé - Isak Edberg [XKatedral 2016]<br></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0062-maria-w-horn%2F&hide_cover=1&light=1\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p>Morton Subotnick is one of those names that will always have a historic resonance. In 1962, along with Terry Riley, Pauline Oliveros and Steve Reich, Subotnick founded 'The San Francisco Tape Music Centre', a collective of musicians working with the medium of tape and improvisational electronic music. In particular, their legendary 'Sonics' concerts became a crucial point of reference for many working in the Avant-Garde. Perhaps most fruitfully, Subotnick (along with Donald Buchla) helped to create the Buchla 100: regarded by many as the first analogue synthesiser ever constructed. Shortly thereafter, his first record, <em>Silver Apples on the Moon</em>, became the first piece of electronic music ever commissioned by a record label. As such, his influence is truly immeasurable.</p>\n<p>Despite a background in classical music, Subotnick has always been staunchly antithetical to traditional modes of music production. One of the important distinctions made between Buchla/Subotnick and Moog was their philosophy on the use of keyboards within this revolutionary music. As Subotnick tells us in <em>I Dream Of Wires</em>, &quot;I said right from the get-go: I don't want a black &amp; white keyboard, because I knew what that was going to be. If I had a keyboard, I was going to produce regular music and that's not what I wanted to do.&quot; But to concentrate simply on Subotnick's historical significance would be to ghettoise a great artist. Written in 1967, <em>Silver Apples</em> indeed gave some their first taste of synthesized music, but the novelty and freshness that spawned that record continues galvanise musicians to this day. It is not simply an intriguing historical artefact, but an imaginative and entrancing work.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow, Subotnick will be performing at Malmö's <a href=\"http://www.intonalfestival.com/\">Intonal Festival</a>, along with video-artist Lillevan. Ahead of his performance, we decided to catch up with Subotnick to talk about his background in working with visual artists, his relationship to modern technology and pop music's avant-garde.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/167369726&color=070707&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Hi Morton, so you’re playing with Lillevan in a few days at Intonal Festival in Malmo. Would you be able to tell me a bit about your collaboration with Lillevan, how that came about, and what the audience can expect?</strong></p>\n<p>When I first started working with analog equipment back in the late 50s and early 60s, I had really intended my work to be for record. So I thought of my home studio as a place where the composer became like a painter. After working in my studio the artwork would end up, instead of on the wall, on someone’s record player. And that was the start of the whole thing. At the same time, I wondered what I’d do on the stage, because I’m not going to just sit and push buttons, nobody could see what I was doing! It was really just for records, just to listen to. So I teamed up with a painter friend of mine, Tony Martin, who was starting to do liquid projections and things like that.</p>\n<p>The idea was that I would play in real time, aspects of what would eventually become a record, and he would paint with liquids in real time, as a kind of duet. And that was way back before rock’n’roll. And so after a while I stopped performing live, and then I started again about 15 years ago when there was more equipment and things like that, and Lillevan was brought in to do the visuals for the opera that I was doing in Berlin, and he really understood and we hit it off really well. So when I perform in public I try to do it with Lillevan almost all the time.</p>\n<p><strong>So do you think the visual component of the performance is a fundamental part of the show?</strong></p>\n<p>It is in a way, it’s like a collaboration work. So I can do the music without visuals and he can do the visuals without music, but together they form a kind of unity. It’s not integral, I would do what I do with or without him, but I’m influenced by him and he’s influenced by what I do because we’re there together. It’s really designed so that he’s doing the kind of thing that I’m doing visually over that period of time. It’s hard to describe, there’s no real model for it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c4.staticflickr.com/2/1681/26483197371_929509db01.jpg\" alt=\"Morton\"></p>\n<p><strong>I noticed that SooJin Anjou will be playing some of your piano work, is this a project that you’ve been involved in?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, so that has electronics with it. It’s not a performance really on my part. I take the piano music and sort of do a subtle taping of it in one of the pieces. I take sound and move it around and change things.</p>\n<p><strong>You’re known for performing with a Buchla modular synthesizer. I’m interested in what other technologies you’re using and how you find they integrate with the Buchla.</strong></p>\n<p>It started when I was using just straight analog equipment and I couldn’t really do as much as I could do in the studio. I was recording and then overdubbing and pulling cables out and putting new cables in. So when I started doing it in public, I realized that I couldn’t just stop and re-patch everything, I was really limited in what I could do without a stage full of equipment, which I wouldn’t have been able to control anyway. That’s when I stopped playing in public for a while, but then when computers got fast enough and small enough, I began to work with different programs (Max and a few others). Finally, I ended up with Ableton, and what I do is I actually multiply the equipment.</p>\n<p>I only have two oscillators, but by putting them in Ableton and multiplying them, and just copying and pasting and using plugins and thing like that, I have the equivalent of 6, 8 or 10 oscillators at a time. So I’m using Ableton to expand the whole use of analog equipment, plus samples and other things that I always did. I used to travel with big tape recorders and things like that, but Ableton just expands my equipment so I have a relatively small component but it’s got all kinds of stuff in it.</p>\n<p><strong>There’s been a bit of a surge, or maybe a return of use of modular synthesizers by modern artists. People like Alessandro Cortini, Kaitlyn Aurelia Amith and Charles Cohen are all using Buchlas, and then a lot of other people are using Eurorack synths. I wondered if that’s something you’ve been following?</strong></p>\n<p>Well I haven’t been following it, I’ve been placed in the middle of it (laughs). I come into it all the time. I’ve sort of been doing my own thing all my life and I get dragged, I shouldn’t say dragged, but I become aware of what’s going on when I get on the stage or when I meet people and things. I haven’t really followed it too well, I don’t know exactly what people are doing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1574/26549441585_41fc236ba1_b.jpg\" alt=\"subotnick\"></p>\n<p><strong>I think for me it signals maybe a greater appetite generally for more experimental music. Some of the artists I mentioned earlier, and also people like Pauline Oliveros, who I believe you’re friends with, she’s appearing on a few lineups at the moment. Would you agree that there is a greater appetite for experimental music than there has been in the past?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah I think so, it appears to be the case. I’m really surprised at how much interest there is. When we began, we were a small group of young musicians doing what seemed odd to a lot of people.  Some few years later, my Silver Apples became well known. But after a while, the world left me alone and I kept doing my thing, trying to finish what I started.  It didn’t bother me, I figured that I’m just doing it and that’s what I do, and gradually I began to see my name appear and I was invited to do things. Over the last 15, 20 years it’s really increased hugely. This movie came out, <em>I Dream Of Wires</em>, and they’re actually talking about doing a documentary on me at this point, so it has grown, and I don’t know what it means but it’s very nice to see. I’m really impressed with everything that’s going on, but I think what’s happening is that there’s more interest generally…</p>\n<p>Let me put it this way: The pop world got it right from the beginning. I was visited by people from The Grateful Dead, things like that. They understood in their own way what was going on. They were interested, and the fine art world, my world of classical music wasn’t really very interested. They were doing instrumental music with electronics, and then, it sort of disappeared, you don’t see a lot of it. I think the avant garde grew out of, not fine art music, but pop music, they were influenced by pop music. And now you’re getting new genres every day, and it’s pretty exciting to see all that happening.</p>\n<p><strong>Absolutely. So outside of modular synthesis, what is exciting you about music at the moment?</strong></p>\n<p>I think what’s interesting to me is two things. One is the diversity of the new avant garde. There are several avant gardes now, but the new avant garde that I was just talking about, of young people who have come out of some combination of pop music, disco and all of those things. It keeps unfolding and you get an avant garde of an avant garde. It just keeps going, and what’s fascinating to me is how interested young people are in doing their own thing instead of copying and making something continue. It’s like it’s an explosion of creativity. That doesn’t mean that creativity is all wonderful and great and all that, but it’s nice to see people really trying to do new things.</p>\n<p><em>You can catch Morton Subotnick at <a href=\"http://www.intonalfestival.com/\">Intonal festival</a> this Saturday.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/214819933&color=000000&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Australian label 3BS seem to be expanding their remit as of late. Their last release from Sydney based Simon Unwin aka Hence Therefore put clattering industrial percussion atop a bed of both rich and murky futurist soundscapes. The latest on the other hand, a split cassette between label head John Papert aka Mannheim Rocket and Cory Champion aka Borrowed cs, might just as easily find its home on Jens Kuhn's Workshop imprint.</p>\n<p>If the release's weightless, micro-house aesthetic weren't enough to suggest this on its own, the tracks' extended lengths similarly call to mind the mind-bending 4/4 trips of Lowtec or Magic Mountain High. Each ramble out over a languid ten minutes, rushing hats and padding tom sounds showing their is still plenty of variation to be explored within drum-machine-centric dance music.</p>\n<p>Borrowed cs' 'Death In High Definition' holds an intoxicated, almost slow motion feel. As the track trips and bumps forward, distant chimes and thin spread telstar-style drones lay out a subtle yet mesmeric hook. There is a charm about Champion's faded VHS aesthetic; even the digital version of the release sounds as if it were being played on a cassette that's been wound back one two many times.</p>\n<p>Comparatively, Mannheim Rocket's offering holds tightly-meshed formation. 'Wasps' ratchets up the tension; ultra-close delays and petrol engine rhythms make a formidable opening; like a jet-fueled version of Rrose's warped technoid experiments. Bedraggled orchestral textures make their introduction slowly, echoing weightlessly atop Papert's thickset drums.</p>\n<p>One of the most interesting things about the release is the way in which both artists deploy the similar techniques to gather startlingly different results. Both tracks centre heavily around slowly evolving beatific soundscapes, using ultra-tight delays and slowly evolving 707/808/909 patterns to craft their narratives. As ever it appears 3BS is still exploring and evolving, and we wouldn't have it any other way.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/257178161&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>The latest release from Berlin-based Anna Vtorova aka Machine Woman is not quite what we expected. Where ‘For Sweden’ her debut vinyl release for Peder Mannerfelt Produktion or the Tesla Tapes released ‘Pink Silk’ cassette explored brooding hybrids of noise and industrial techno, ‘Genau House’ show’s Vtorova’s softer side.</p>\n<p>According to the press release, the 12&quot; is the product of a series of misfiring Tinder dates Vtorova went on, expressing a combination of longing and technological angst. ’I can mend your broken heart’ certainly seems to fit the blueprint. AGF reminiscent vocals open the track, fluttering plosive’s filling the stereo field. As intoxicating chords roll out beneath a resilient 4/4 stomp, Vtorova’s vocals become increasingly obscured - however far from detracting from them this only adds to their seductive quality. A teeming forest of glitches and roughshod snares both cement the track’s rhythm and push it into the realms of Jan Jelinek inspired oddity.</p>\n<p>‘Friday Night’ on the other hand expresses a more direct form of lust. As muscular as the chunkiest of Kris Wadsworth offerings, the track bumps and grinds at a lethargic tempo, swelling bass and low-pitched vocals drawling out agonisingly. ‘You feel alone’ is repeated like a kind of 8am comedown mantra, while drilling percussion jerks the listener to and fro.</p>\n<p>The release is rounded off with a remix of the a-side offering from hardware extraordinaire Kassem Mosse. Mosse cuts the track down to its bare essentials, pulling Vtorova’s softly spoken vocals forward to almost uncomfortable levels of intimacy.</p>\n<p>It’s slightly strange to think this is only the second release from esteemed UK label Where To Now? we’ve reviewed, and even more odd considering it’s not quite typical of the rest of their catalogue. To my mind the label is best defined by oddball sonic experiments from the likes of Jesse Osborne-Lanther or Nicola Ratti, which border on the conceptual. This said, if there’s one artist that was going to provide an undoubtedly floor friendly release that simultaneously fits their avante-garde aesthetic, Machine Woman was always going to be a good match. From both her and Where To Now?, we look forward to the next surprise.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/261626362&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Pär Grindvik is a true veteran of the Swedish techno scene. As a producer, he has remained a consistent contributor since the early 2000s, delving deep into genre's mind-bending, early-hours extremities. Grindvik's label Stockholm LTD has been of equal importance since its founding in 2002, featuring everyone from André Kronert to Pfirter and Jeroen Search.</p>\n<p>Although largely an outlet for bugged-out 6am thumpers, the imprint has also hosted some significantly more avante-garde musings, a personal favourite being last year's split between Grindvik and fellow Swede Peder Mannerfelt, 'Corded'. The record explored a combination of crushing static, mine-shaft rhythms and Lovecraftian drones, the two artists complementing each other perfectly.</p>\n<p>The most recent release, Grindvik's <em>Isle Of Real</em> explores a similar pairing of dancefloor and abstract ideas, and considering it marks his debut album, holds together remarkably coherently. Grindvik uses a combination of glacial snowscapes and tripped out 4/4 to create an LP as apt for the club as it is home listening. Track's like 'Never Give In' find themselves in the realms of '90s Warp experimentalism, while 'The Marlton' on the other hand could easily be a technoid rendition of a UK Grime instrumental.</p>\n<p>With the album due for release shortly, we asked Grindvik to contribute something slightly different to our That Time When series, discussing five of the gigs he most regrets missing over the years.</p>\n<p>###1 Motörhead - Anywhere_Anytime</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7127/26231594973_b3d4df76b6_b.jpg\" alt=\"mh\"></p>\n<p>I had so may chances to see Motörhead, as, like many others, I never thought that Lemmy would leave the stage. <em>Another Perfect Day</em> was my first ever album. I got it from my older brothers after telling them that I liked hard rock. The truth is that already at the age of four I was way more into synthesisers than guitars. Then Howard Jones released the <em>The 12&quot; Album</em> and the year after I was doomed - sorry Lemmy please don't hate me! Fortunately as an adult I've spent way more time with Lemmy than Howard and I will always regret that I didn't take the chance to see him live.</p>\n<p>###2 Kraftwerk - Lund_1991</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7655/26230756714_8ccdfa8b11_b.jpg\" alt=\"kw\"></p>\n<p>In 1991 Kraftwerk released <em>The Mix</em> and during that tour they played in Sweden for the first time. I remember how badly I wanted to go. They did two dates, one show in Stockholm and one in Lund in the south of Sweden. The Lund show become legendary! One of my older cousins attended that show and managed to record some of it, a tape that I've probably listened to a thousand times.</p>\n<p>###3 Orbital - Annexet_1994</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7791/26563497730_d9aa4e5e6f_b.jpg\" alt=\"orb\"></p>\n<p>I can't remember why I didn't go to this one. I remember that I had the flyer and that people where buzzing about it so much both before and after! It wasn't everyday an electronic act performed a concert of that size in Sweden and I think that Orbital, with their majestic, melodic tunes and flashlight glasses fit the format just perfectly.</p>\n<p>###4 Grace Jones - Berlin_2009</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7168/26801990536_aa4a7c0aa1_b.jpg\" alt=\"gj\"></p>\n<p>I've always been a Grace fan and I think that she still has the same amazing presence with everything she does! When she released the <em>Hurricane</em> album in 2008-9? I was a bit sceptical about the record at first, but to be honest, the album stays true to both her artistry and the flavour of its time. Grace's 'One Man Show' is one of my absolute favourite music films and seeing her live has always been on my bucket-list, so when she was set to play Berlin in March 2009 I was excited to go, but in the end something got in the way! My daughter Morris was born a month too early.</p>\n<p>###5 Cymande - Berlin_2016</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7171/26230758534_76979ae60a_b.jpg\" alt=\"cy\"></p>\n<p>It took me a while to choose the last one, but in the end it was just so obvious! Cymande are touring again and will be in Berlin this Saturday. Unfortunately there is zero chance I will be able to catch them as I’m traveling myself, such a pity really. Nothing gets my one year old Otis and myself in a better mood that listening to Cymande in the kitchen, preparing dinner before the rest of the family gets home.

    "content": "<p>Chloe Frieda's Alien Jams began life on the airwaves. Her NTS show of the same name explores a wide assembly of everything from space-gazing electronica to '80s industrial/electro homages. Despite expanding the project with the launch of the Alien Jams label, Frieda has stayed similarly free-spirited in her releases, taking in everything from Marreck's whirlpooling sci-fi to the Radiophonic squelchings of oMMM. The latest in the catalogue is a split 12&quot; from Opal Tapes affiliate Karen Gwyer and fellow NTS-er Beatrice Dillon.</p>\n<p>Aside from her radio work, online presence doesn't seem to be too much of a concern for the London-based Dillon. This said, it hasn't stopped her from becoming a relatively widely talked about individual. She has also managed to avoid categorisation remarkably well; she has worked with classical composer Rupert Clervaux, yet has similarly navigated avante-techno circles with ease, releasing on esteemed label-of-the-moment Where To Now? late last year. A number of weeks ago I witnessed her expand her stylistic reach even further, playing an array of tripped-out dub and reggae at London's Corsica Studios.</p>\n<p>Dub is almost the strongest hallmark of her contribution to the split. Entitled 'Curl', the a-side offering forces plodding bleeps and ruptured synthetics through a series of ultra-tight reverbs and delays. The effect calls to mind some of the more rugged escapades of Italian Planet Mu signee Herva; shuddering, sub-heavy kicks holding tight-formation beneath Dillon's snowballing metallic hook.</p>\n<p>Gwyer's offering, 'Common Soundproofing Myths', releases the pressure somewhat. There is something almost familiar of '70s Krautrock psychedelia in Gwyer's meandering synth lines, building to a squelching acid cacophony in the track's latter half. The melodic components grate mercilessly against uniformly overdriven, cut-stop rhythms as detuned synthesisers divebomb between a barrage of snares, which seem to disintegrate on impact.</p>\n<p>Having reached the Alien Jams project the wrong way round, discovering the label before sampling Frieda's generous array of radio shows, my perception of the project is probably somewhat skewed. Having said this, whichever way you approach it, it's clear to see that both enterprises are being managed with a consistent level of quality and creativity, which can only be commended as Alien Jams continues to grow.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/257264226&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>On their <em>Tunnel</em> EP, Robin Buckley — better known as rkss — inverted the idea of ‘field recordings’ by sampling randomly generated YouTube videos. Rather than capturing non-musical sounds in a natural environment, Buckley surveyed a digital landscape: recording the unintended and extraneous noise from visual media. But despite its unorthodox construction, <em>Tunnel</em> still retained some elements of a traditional release. There were standout tracks, highlights and tracks you could dance to. The same went for 2015’s follow-up, <em>Cell</em>. Here, Buckley mashed together bits and pieces from abstract jams and reinserted them into a club-friendly context. But Buckley’s latest album, <em>Top Charted</em>, is of an entirely different enterprise.</p>\n<p>Techno, concrete and nocturnal ambience are nowhere to be found here. It sounds more like something from a 1960’s Sci Fi television programme, commissioned by the Radiophonic Workshop. Throughout the album’s journey, new textures pop in and out to say hello, as if the ident for a new alien character. Some are bold and colourful, others sound as if lifted straight from a “euphoric trance” sample pack. On ‘Stole Day White’, we hear a familiar EDM synth loop, but bit-crushed, tremolo-ed and filtered out of all recognition. This is Buckleys new source of experimentation. The album exists in this kind of nether-space, there to confound expectation and unsettle the listener. There are no track breaks, no drops, and no departure from its weird world. Befitting then, that like their previous albums, this is a release on cassette: that most otherworldly of formats.</p>\n<p>Reflecting on this new direction, Buckley has stated that he is “glad to be pushing into a direction which makes more sense to me”. This newfound enthusiasm feeds directly into the music: you can hear the care and love that has been put into these sonic oddities. Where to Now? therefore seems like an apt home for Buckley’s latest excursion: a label long committed to making electronic music fun again. Even the artwork tells this story, covered in garish beams of fluorescent pink light that look like some kind of radioactive rock candy. This is Buckley's pop record, their ‘chart-topper’, but not in any serious sense.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=286423337/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=f171a2/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://wheretonow.bandcamp.com/album/top-charted\">Top Charted by rkss</a></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Although largely known for the unrelenting, industrial warehouse stompers of his Pennyroyal or Bedouin releases, the work of Jesse Kuyé aka J.Tijn has a deal more nuances when you delve slightly deeper. His contributions to WNCL Recordings for example have utilised a lighter touch.</p>\n<p>His most recent EP for the label, 'Half Empty Half Full', covers everything from the low-slung, Workshop indebted drum-machine excursions of 'Fat Controller' to the peak-time chaos of 'Malaria'. And then there's the title track, (abbreviated to 'Hehf') placing blissfully warm, crunching house tones atop Kuyé's thickset 4/4 grooves. Both this and his previous contribution to the imprint, 'Flat', present a much wider spectrum of dancefloor pursuits than you might have come to expect from undeniably effective dancefloor bombs such as 'Squirtle Squad' or 'Nuke', while still maintaining Kuyé's signature, amp-driven tonal palette.</p>\n<p>For the latest in our That Time When series, we invited Kuyé to tell us about five of his most memorable gigging experiences, from introducing his Sister to Techno at Amsterdam's H7 Warehouse, to Buckfast fueled rampages at London's Corsica Studios.</p>\n<p>###1 – Intercell at H7 Warehouse - Amsterdam_2015</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7663/26998790516_7a14ca1ea5_b.jpg\" alt=\"q\"></p>\n<p>This was a sick night in general but what made it especially wicked for me was the fact that my younger sister had come from London for the weekend and got to see her first Techno night. She’s heard techno around the house and stuff from early but I never imagined she’d enjoy it as much as she did. Weed helped...</p>\n<p>###2 Plex/BleeD/Them at Corsica Studios - London_2014</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7041/26370636034_5ba2a49f2d_b.jpg\" alt=\"a\"></p>\n<p>This was a historic one, they were serving glasses of Buckfast so it was always due to end in carnage. Never seen so many pissed up DJs running around one venue to be honest. It’s a total blank to me but I’ve heard I was rendered unable to continue midway through my set and one of the promoters had to take over. Mad.</p>\n<p>###3 Beukplaten at ITW Loods - Amsterdam_2014</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7358/26942519666_5a503cf9dd_b.jpg\" alt=\"w\"></p>\n<p>'Dam again. I'm pretty sure this was the first time JoeFarr and I actually met in the flesh, despite having a song already out by that time. The energy for the whole night was unbelievable and by the end of our set we had folk dancing on top of the speaker boxes! There’s a video somewhere that I wish I could find.</p>\n<p>###4 Blackest Ever Black at Basing House - London_2011</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7246/26370636254_c9661e45dd_b.jpg\" alt=\"z\"></p>\n<p>This was like the second or third techno night I ever went to, I’d spent the previous few days binge listening to recordings of British Murder Boys sets and when I saw the line-up (Raime, Regis, Cut Hands, Surgeon, BMB) I knew I had to just mission it on my own. It didn’t disappoint, I reckon it was the first time I properly allowed myself to get totally involved in the music with no social obligations at all. A huge bonus was seeing Cut Hands for the first time as well. It was around the time he was doing the Afro Noise stuff live - a proper mind-warper.</p>\n<p>###5 Ruptured at Corsica Studios - London_2010</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7616/26370636434_bfa66eff51_z.jpg\" alt=\"t\"></p>\n<p>I can’t remember exactly when this was but it was the first and only time I’ve seen Equinox (Scientific Wax) play. If you’ve seen him you understand but if you haven’t you need to. The dude is on fire, he gets so involved as well.

    "content": "<p>In Elephant &amp; Castle's Corsica Studios, little more than a lonely disco-ball hang as decoration. This makes it one of the few clubs left in London to remain devoid of any superficial glitz or shallow glam. Instead, this is a place for hedonistic music loving. A dance-floor for pill-heads and techno-veterans. But thanks to a handful of promoters, this extraordinary venue has begun to open its doors to music beyond the dance-floor. Corsica Studios may not be the first venue to mind when it comes to live shows and guitar bands. But this May will see performances from Jambinai and Jessy Lanza, and last week, Fire records came to town.</p>\n<p>The Fire imprint began as a label for pop that was weird and wonky. Pulp, Half-Japanese, Guided by Voices and Neutral Milk Hotel have all spent time there, exploring the geeky side to psychedelia. During their time at Fire, these bands were more concerned with whimsy and imagination than with politics or true love. The new prodigies of the label, Noveller and Virginia Wing, flow from this neo-psychedelic tradition. But their vision is more futuristic than their daydreaming counterparts. Virginia Wing’s performance in particular was decidedly Sci-Fi. Soft sine-waves and benign alarm-sounds popped around the room, as if at the helm of a spaceship control room. Soaring above the electric hum of machines, a reverb-drenched chorus sang of floating aimlessly through air.</p>\n<p>‘Guitar-ambient’ may seem like the kind of thing you’d expect to hear from a busker in Camden. But Noveller’s approach to the genre is by no means incidental. Her hazy walls of noise tower above the audience like ancient monuments. Noveller’s influence also never falls too far from rock roots. Power-stances, doom metal and head-banging all make appearances. Her sound is bold and brilliant: slathered in coats of overdrive and echo. A board of stomp-boxes like that can take the guitar to all kinds of vibrant worlds. This show was something of a precursor to a support slot with Iggy Pop at the Royal Albert Hall. But inside the dank interior of Corsica Studios, Noveller took us from watery caves to open skies.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/170325561&color=000000&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>You'd be hard pushed to find a more fitting addition to the SM-LL imprint than their latest signee, Vialan. Based in Aaarhus Denmark, Vialan's contribution to the label comes in the form of 'Default 0007' and is very much attuned to the ultra-minimal hardware musings of the imprint's founder, Pokk! Covering seven tracks of crackling, thinned-out dub and technoid beat experiments, 'Default 0007' delves deep into the world of drum machine experimentation.</p>\n<p>Speaking to Vialan earlier this month, although always important, it  appears minimalist electronics haven't been the only focus for Vialan over the years. &quot;I got into electronic music sometime in the early '80s when I heard Kraftwerk’s 'Spacelab' played on national radio&quot; he begins when quizzed on his early musical interests. &quot;I was totally amazed - those futuristic sounds were far away from anything I’d ever heard! Fortunately, I recorded it to cassette. I remember making a small exhibition in my room of LEGO spaceships - the space theme seemed to go perfectly with the sound of 'Spacelab'.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Later I discovered Depeche Mode and then I got into Italo-disco. I remember listening to “Discoboksen”, a show on local radio playing all these fresh Italo-disco tracks and mixes. I was into the early electro/hip-hop scene as well and still love a lot of it, especially the Street Sounds 'New York vs L.A. Beats' mix. Later, at high school, I would often go to the local library looking for interesting records and books about the Dadaists. I would hang out in the local record store, buying Cabaret Voltaire, Throbbing Gristle, Einstürzende Neubauten, Skinny Puppy, Front 242 etc. I also listened to punk and more experimental electronic music like Stockhausen and Xenakis.&quot;</p>\n<p>Following his school years, Vialan began studying Electronic Engineering before moving to Ireland, departing music for a time due to tinnitus amongst other things. Luckily the hiatus didn't last. &quot;At the end of the '00s I started getting into making music again. I still had some of my old equipment, and slowly started learning Ableton. It took quite some time and when I finally felt I had grasped it, something felt wrong. I discovered I enjoyed making music using hardware a lot more than making music in the box, so I created a setup where I could work without a computer. Most of the tracks on the SM-LL release are excerpts from longish hardware jams, recorded from the main outs of my mixer into a digital recorder. The sound on some of them was quite bad, but Martin [Thompson from SM-LL] did an excellent job mastering them into something a lot better for the Default 0007 release.&quot;</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3900952672/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://sm-ll.bandcamp.com/album/vialan-default-0007\">Vialan - Default 0007 by Vialan</a></iframe>\n<p>Vialan initially began communicating with SM-LL through Soundcloud around a year ago. From there it appears the progression towards arranging a release was a very natural one. &quot;I messaged him, mentioning I was a big fan of Pokk! and SM-LL&quot; he responds when asked about how the release was formed. &quot;Somehow we got into discussing Roland classics, specifically the CR-78 and the RE-201. Inspired by our conversation I quickly did a track based around the CR-78 kick through the RE-201. Martin liked it and the rest is history (laughs). I already had his releases from Sonuos and An Epic and at about the same time started buying the releases on SM-LL. I’ve bought lots of releases through Bandcamp, but Martin was the first one ever to reply with a nice personal mail saying thanks for the support. That made a major impression on me - discovering that the person releasing some of the cleanest, coolest, most interesting and disciplined music I had heard was also a very polite and nice person.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;We send back and forth a lot of ideas, thoughts, tracks and sketches. Honestly I was a bit unsure if I was spamming him or not, so I was a bit nervous when I met up with Lucia and him at Intonal Festival in Sweden, at Malmø’s St. Johannes Church. We met right after Rroses brilliant live performance of 'Having Never Written a Piece for Percussion'. Fortunately, Martin and Lucia both turned out to be even nicer persons in real life than I’d hoped. Lucia and Martin also introduced me to a lot of other nice people, like Finn Albertsson (DJ Finn Of Tomland). Funny thing, because it was Finn’s recommendation on Bandcamp that originally introduced me to SM-LL.&quot;</p>\n<p>'Default 0007' is the product of a series of jams conducted by Vialan - his preferred method of working. Martin and Lucia of SM-LL then set about curating these live sessions into a coherent release, with Vialan left intrigued by their final cuts. &quot;At first I was quite surprised by their selection&quot; he states. &quot;It’s quite varied in style - I guess. But after a few listens I found that the tracks kind of supported each other in a good way. And started really liking how the tracks supplemented each other. I’m quite glad they did the selection as I really dislike listening to my own tracks.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;The tracks were produced over a long period of time and putting them next to each other seemed weird at first. Funny thing is, the tracks were produced very differently. The first track “Juno Dyb” was a snippet of a very simple dub recorded through the microphone of my old iPhone. Martin had asked me about how my Juno was doing. My reply was that it was well - and still had the dub. I included the recording to prove my point. Imagine I was quite surprised when they suggested that as the opening track.&quot;</p>\n<p>Vialan's mix for us features a number of the cuts which didn't make it into the final release alongside some more uptempo offerings. In his own words the podcast was his &quot;first mix since making mixtapes in the early '90s, and plenty of tracks were harmed during the making...&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist</strong></p>\n<p>Latex Lynx - Çause [Night Vision Tapes] <br/>\nMonoton - HZ Waltz [Oral] <br/>\n*slo-Fi - Untitled (7) [Microwave Recordings]  <br/>\nØ - Ilta [Sähkö Recordings]  <br/>\nYves De Mey - 228r [SM-LL]  <br/>\nVialan - Rainy 303 (Session #13) [UNRELEASED]  <br/>\nSPK - Stammheim Torturkammer [Side Effects]  <br/>\nClock DVA - Buried Dreams [Interfisch Records]  <br/>\nLundin Oil - Tear Gas Reason [Northern Electronics]  <br/>\nGoem - ∞ 9 [Microwave Recordings]  <br/>\nClock DVA - Dark Attractor [Contempo Records]  <br/>\nSPK - In Flagrante Delicto [The Grey Area]  <br/>\nVialan - DR-55 Session #01 [UNRELEASED]  <br/>\nElse Marie Pade - Syv Cirkler (c.i.r.k.l.e.r.)

    "content": "<p>Berlin-based Kyoka was one of the first Raster-Noton artists I heard to really challenge the imprint’s sonic stereotype. Her 2014 album <em>Is (Is Superpowered</em>) featured an idiosyncratic and whimsical use of her own vocals, in contrast to the rather serious poly-rhythmic glitch that defined previous releases (aside perhaps from Atom™’s wickedly satirical muse on pop-culture, <em>HD</em>). Using her voice in an improvised and non-lyrical style, her vocal samples were spliced and resampled in a method that mirrors Dada-ist cut-up techniques.</p>\n<p>Years before her affiliation with Raster-Noton however, Kyoka was already obsessed with machine-generated sound. In her early years she used tape recorders to manipulate audio and the obsession grew from there. Picked up by Mitte Musique sub-label Onpa))))) in 2008, her releases have evolved slowly; the chaotic, adrenaline-charged feel of her early tracks slowly refined, maturing in sound.</p>\n<p>Her latest release, ‘SH’, was created following a series of recording sessions at Stockholm’s EMS Studio, a place which Kyoka refers to as ‘paradise’. The record sees her shedding her use of vocals while still retaining plenty of the stylistic quirks of her previous releases - albeit in a more subtle, dynamic way. With the record released a few months ago, we decided to catch up with Kyoka to discuss the new EP, chance online encounters with Ryuchi Sakamoto and clubbing culture around the globe.</p>\n<p><strong>Hi Kyoka, first off how are things? You were in Japan recently right?</strong></p>\n<p>Good thanks! I was in Japan and then Barcelona for a show. It was really nice in the end, even though it was different from my usual set and it was a new challenge for me. I chose a movie I've liked for many years and then created a live soundtrack for it. It was fun! I used a short film from a Korean artist. When I was in Japan I played at the Contemporary Art Museum in Oita, Kyusyu, as well as clubs in Tokyo and Iwate. All amazingly beautiful as usual. But now, in Kyusyu, they’ve just had a big earthquake... I feel very very sad about it, and hope they can live a normal life again soon...</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us a bit more about how you first started working with Raster-Noton... I read you were first introduced to the label after Frank Bretschneider saw one of your gigs in Berlin. Do you remember the occasion? How long after did the 'Ish' EP come together?</strong></p>\n<p>It was my first concert in Berlin, in 2008. It was at Dense Records - it was everyone’s favourite record shop. There were always people there, it was a very charismatic store. Frank just happened to be there. My first EP for Raster-Noton was released in 2012, but I’d already started working on it in 2010 or 2011. In 2010 I released on Onpa))))) and some of the tracks that weren’t taken by Onpa))))) would luckily be taken by Raster-Noton. It helped me to understand how judgement works - that musical taste has no rules. This fact helped me to feel more free. I respect both label's choices and actually both really sound like myself to me. The first release in my life was in 2008 on Onpa))))) - at that point I had already been making music for ten years.</p>\n<p>I love the people on Raster-Noton like family, so I’d love to continue to release with them. They’re just very nice and inspiring people to work with. Plus, though it is a bit of a different point of view, I’m not super good at networking and it would take a lot of energy to meet people from new labels. Why should I find another label besides Raster-Noton? I am very happy to spend my effort and energy on music creation, not finding labels…</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/140532115&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Frank and Robert Lippok helped a bit with <em>Is (Is Superpowered)</em> I believe too, what was their role in the process?</strong></p>\n<p>They are mentors. When I finished the demo for my album I asked them both to listen, and they gave me their own ideas. Their ideas are very surprising to me sometimes. I battle to see myself in an objective way and they helped me balance my objectivity.</p>\n<p>I could see Frank and Robert were different in their approach and both are wonderful artists. That difference encouraged me to be natural. For example if I see only Frank’s way of working, it might cause a sense of inferiority for me… because it is very hard to control things as perfectly as him. Also, Robert can express special wild beauties in music. But also, I'm not the same as him.</p>\n<p>They helped me a lot in gaining confidence as an individual. I’m originally Japanese and it seems we are not educated to have much confidence because having confidence can be considered arrogant in some situations. This is an extreme example, but for us, the person who says ‘Oh, sorry, I’m so stupid’ or &quot;I am such a naive musician&quot; can also be a great/respectable/smart/polite person. Or, it might even be a unique way to let people around you relax... It is a kind of practical joke on yourself. Working with Frank and Robert let me get far away from this Japanese, polite-cultural-confusion.</p>\n<p>In the end, in Berlin I am trained to be very direct. When I met Frank he told me he liked my direct expression with music. Maybe I was direct already but it came out in the music more. Here I learnt more direct expression and it grew my potential more and I really enjoy my life because of that! I feel I am able to open a lid on my head when I need to since I got to Berlin.</p>\n<p><strong>I read you grew up playing a range of classical instruments - piano, flute and the syamisen. Were you interested in electronic music even then?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m not sure if I was at that point. Because I didn't know the existence of electronic music at that time. But I already liked the noises of tapes and video players. I even liked the light reflections from CDs (laughs). Actually at around three or four years old I was already excited when I would see machines. I wanted to open them and look inside to know what makes them function… I would open them up but I was very little and I had nothing to do with them so I would close them again (laughs).</p>\n<p>But this youthful frustration brought me to the library in my elementary school. To be honest, it was not easy to find books which I could understand. So, I just tried to touch the broken machines and made improvised self tests with them. I was addicted to the connection between machine systems and their functions since I was around 5 or 6 years old. I even had an envious feeling towards the people who made them before I was born.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/146267191&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>'Groopies' was one of your early projects right? I read Ryuchi Sakamoto contacted you about that and there is a quote on the Raster-Noton website about you from him. How did that come about?</strong></p>\n<p>I think it happened by an internet miracle! One day I was surfing on a lot of different websites, trying to find a good one. When I found a web-designer from Nobuko, I contacted her and told her I liked her site. She offered to teach me how to make that kind of website … But at that moment I was in Los Angeles and she was in Tokyo.</p>\n<p>One day I went back to Tokyo for a while and I met her. We made three songs the day we first met and put them on Myspace. After a while, some miracle connection happened. Ryuchi Sakamoto kindly contacted us… there was no reason behind it, just chance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1703/26054939744_409269d662_z.jpg\" alt=\"k2\"></p>\n<p><em>Kyoka at the EMS Studio</em></p>\n<p><strong>'SH' came out recently - something you worked on at the EMS studio in Stockholm... How did you end up working there?</strong></p>\n<p>EMS has a Buchla synthesiser which is probably one of the most biggest original ones in Europe. On my first day at the EMS, the engineer locked me into the studio with Buchla for eight hours! He gave me some instructions on how to use it and kindly locked me in (laughs). I was very happy about that! Then I kept exploring how Buchla sounds and how it responds to each function. The next day I continued exploring it.</p>\n<p>I tried to understand about basic sound generation in Buchla. It was simple. Before Buchla, when I used an analog tool, the machine was already complete - like with a synthesiser for example. But with Buchla I build it up by patching. It was like mediation for me - to really understand the meaning of synthesisers. Then I recorded some sounds and found they were good for jamming with, so I decided to include them on my new EP. I’m always thinking about composing music, so when I find the right sounds I have to make music with them.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/146266368&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a bit more about the history of the EMS? I only found out about it recently.</strong></p>\n<p>A few years ago, it was their 40th anniversary - they have a long history. They started as a collaborative project between radio stations. So, they have about six studios, a conference room and also a library. They also have a tool shop. So if I want to make a new synthesiser I can use the tools there. For me, it’s an amusement paradise. I even thought about living in Sweden for a while. EMS increased my potential and I always experiment when I am there.</p>\n<p><strong>And how long were you in Stockholm to visit the EMS?</strong></p>\n<p>Last year I was there probably for a few one-week sessions. The city is very nice but whenever I go I’m always inside the EMS (laughs). Hotel or EMS.</p>\n<p>There is a nice river in front of the studios - twice I was there in the winter and the river was frozen over. Sometimes the river freezes in Berlin but it was the first time I saw people skating on a natural river. It’s super big so the people looked like ants! The first time I thought there might be dust on my contact lens (laughs), but it was humans skating. A taxi driver told me twenty years ago they could drive on the ice. So in the winter they could make a shortcut to Finland! It was beyond my reality.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/219205182&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I've only been to Stockholm once but that part of the world feels very relaxed compared to living in London...</strong></p>\n<p>It seems very busy in London… Maybe I imagine the lifestyle as similar to Tokyo somehow. A lot of clubbing I imagine. One of my Japanese friends told me - she used to live in London until four months ago - people go clubbing, but when the clubs close they have an after-party, then a second after-party and a third after-party without any special reason... It’s already morning! But is it true?</p>\n<p>One time I went to the UK to perform and I went to some parties with the organisers and their friends. I realised if I went out with these people all the time I would die soon. (laughs)</p>\n<p><strong>Tokyo had quite a strict clubbing scene until quite recently with the Fieho laws no?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah the anti-dancing laws. Now it’s getting better but they’ve already destroyed the clubs and clubbing scene once. Now, it is time to recover or transform into something else.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7587/26905717940_2bc4ae38f4_b.jpg\" alt=\"k1\"></p>\n<p><strong>​How did you end up settling in Berlin? What is it you like about the city having lived in a number of different countries?</strong></p>\n<p>My first visit to Berlin was July. It was a beautiful summer day. It was the reason I moved here to Berlin. For me, living in a safe country is important. I used to live in a less-safe situation - fear stole my freedom and creation. Berlin is safe enough. It is a wonderful thing for me every day.</p>\n<p><strong>Your vocals are a feature that have defined previous work to some extent. Why did you decide to leave them off this latest release?</strong></p>\n<p>This time I wanted to make something super-neutral. Even from my first release I’d always try not to show my nationality, or categorise myself. But my voice always helped me when I was composing music; whenever I started writing I found my voice could pull it in any direction.</p>\n<p>This time I wanted to try something different though. But I didn’t know that people think my voice is the character of my music until I released 'SH'. When I am asked by people 'why no voice?', at last I realise that vocals are quite a defining character of my music!</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think much about the reception to your work when you're writing?</strong></p>\n<p>I just think about sound itself when I compose. I should not be swayed by the reception. To keep throwing people fresh and pure ideas is more important.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/244594664&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Female:pressure is a network of musicians, producers and DJs so wide and disparate, it is sometimes difficult to digest. Spend enough time on there however, and you will encounter genius equally wide-ranging in nature. A recent encounter of mine has been NYC based Rose Joyce, aka starvingpoet. Joyce's work is chaotic, unpolished and above all else, captivatingly unconventional. A fitting comparison might be (for those who were lucky enough to catch them), the codine-dipped early twitter-released collaborations of Actress and Zomby; frenetic beat experiments with an overarching aesthetic somewhere between grime, ambient, trip-hop and industrial.</p>\n<p>Where many producers use Soundcloud as a tool to tease listeners with upcoming releases or entice labels with one or two key selections, Joyce's profile operates like an open diary. Most tracks fill just a few minutes, launching directly into their midst's with little concern for traditional structures. The effect is to thrust the listener into unfamiliar sonic worlds, leaving them with the same tantalising sense of suspense as they begun with.</p>\n<p>If you expected Joyce's released works to follow a more coherent format however, you'd be sorely mistaken. As it stands this is just <em>ج ن نƧEL​-​-​und Bacc uЯ—Round2אורجَنَّة</em> at the moment, a Bandcamp LP self-released by Joyce compiling 13 of her most daring sonic escapades. From the opening fizzed-out glitch of '夕Yūu LooP Trix Fox Trax AO夕' to the album's closing, 'Pythic Mother Of Pearls And Prostitutes' which is part amphetamine charged ghetto-house, part Gladiator closing sequence, there is never a dull moment.</p>\n<p>This is not to say the release doesn't have its more introspective moments however. 'LSD LUX' sounds like being directly wired into a computer mainframe at the Hadron Collider, discordant chimes and reversed percussion darting between one another. 'Yweastern Syvx 109 °' on the other hand places plummeting orchestral samples alongside jarring thrusts of static, like the culmination of several acid trips all at once.</p>\n<p>It's clear from the DIY nature of Joyce's work and releases that these mark early steps for the starvingpoet project, yet the quality of her productions is mature way beyond the realms of Bandcamp released debuts. What is even more startling is the fact the tracks included here feel as if they've been put together in short live sessions; freeform and largely improvised. Listen to the way in which 'From Pearl Fountain FloorsᘔჷܨBL_|ack HAllsSϛܨϨ' for example maneuvers gently from sultry bass-grooves to hollowed-out static drones.</p>\n<p>In short, <em>ج ن نƧEL​-​-​und Bacc uЯ—Round2אורجَنَّة</em> is overspilling with fractured ideas and is all the better for its unorthodox nature. I greatly look forward to the next development.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=512413873/size=small/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/artwork=none/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://starvingpoet.bandcamp.com/album/el-und-bacc-u-round2\">ج ن نƧEL--und Bacc uЯ—Round2אורجَنَّة by starvingpoet</a></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>I often wonder if we review too much music from Café OTO at Stray Landings. Tucked away in a dusty Dalston sidestreet, exactly how important can this dingy dwelling be? Well, their steadfast booking policy has a standard that is basically unmatched anywhere else in London. Here, and nowhere else, you can find both genre-defining pioneers and left-field newcomers. This has therefore cemented OTO as an institution of London’s live music landscape, and ought to be cherished as such. This year will see performances from David Toop, Ian William Craig, Morton Feldman, Magma and Peder Mannerfelt. And this week, ambient legend Laraaji boarded the stage with a range of zithers, gongs and whirly tubes.</p>\n<p>Both the recorded and live component of Laraaji's music centres on one thing: meditation. His performance began, appropriately enough, in silence. For 15 long minutes, the audience held their breath as Laraaji tuned his zithers with painstaking accuracy. After some palette-cleansing gong drones to set the tone, he began his journey through <em>The Dance</em>, his most celebrated piece. His compositions in general are meant to be trips: heady and intoxicating pieces crafted to spiral the listener into vanishing vastness. <em>The Dance</em> works especially well in this regard, comprised of intricate polyrhythms on two micro-tuned zithers. As he laps along medieval scales, new layers of tone are added on top of one another. With each towering crescendo, the mood is lifted to ever dizzying heights. The disorienting effect is like a psychic vertigo, leaving the audience giddy and high.</p>\n<p><em>The Dance</em> is the piece of music that brought Laraaji to the public eye. During Brian Eno's late 70s heyday, it was this work that was featured as the third instalment of his legendary <em>Ambient Series</em>. Unlike the records that came before it, <em>Music for Airports</em> and Harold Budd's <em>The Plateaux of Mirror</em>, this was a record truly alive with vitality. Even now, the fresh vibrancy of those recordings comes through. If you can stomach the billowing clouds of orange and the new-age natter about ‘energies’ and ‘radiance’ - which are integral to Laraaji's performances - you can find ambient music that achieves a rare combination of mystery and fun. &quot;Happy eternity to you&quot; he said, before his unexpected and humorous encore of &quot;This Little Light of Mine&quot;.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tMBNKmZgs_Y?rel=0&showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Based in Milan, Italy, Nicola Ratti is a figure well-regarded in the world of avante-electronics. Since his debut release in 2006, Ratti has explored rough-edged granular sampling, subtle experiments in micro-tonality and abstracted dancefloor themes. His Where To Now? released <em>Pressure Loss</em> LP earlier this year showcased a bewilderingly complex and creative use of limited tools. Ratti composed the work using just a Serge Modular and an ARP2500 Synthesiser at Rotterdam's WORM Studios creating a rich tapestry of pulsing rhythmic tones.</p>\n<p>Although his music has plenty in common with the rather stoic world of experimental sonic study, he also gives nods to other, more accessible genres.  His releases with lifelong friend Giuseppe Ielasi as 'Bellows' for example, gives plenty of hints to lo-fi post-rock and shoegaze electronica, while his 2015 'Wounded Boys' cassette has moments of plodding dub and itching hi-end grooves.</p>\n<p>With the release of <em>Pressure Loss</em>, a number of shows and more material both solo and collaborative forthcoming, 2016 appears to be a fruitful year for Ratti. We decided to catch up with him to discuss Auna, a small festival he helps organise, the benefits of limitation and the importance of space when performing.</p>\n<p><strong>Hi Nicola, how are things? I've been really enjoying <em>Pressure Loss</em> lately, and impressed with the limitations you set yourself when composing it. Is this typical of the way you work, limiting yourself to certain sounds or instruments?</strong></p>\n<p>Ciao, things are fine thanks. Really happy you're enjoying my work! Yes - it's a choice I've made over the last few albums. Nevertheless what I am using lately (modular synth systems) have in their nature an impressive auditory palette even if as I do, you use only a few elements of the whole system. My thinking is that the complexity achieved by minimal variations of pitch, rhythm and dynamics of a very limited number of clear pulsations is much more intense and deep than a group of sounds with different nature and origin.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7507/26974481450_d96fd65326_b.jpg\" alt=\"q\"></p>\n<p><em>The Pressure Loss LP</em></p>\n<p><strong>Was the concept for the LP something you came up with at WORM Studios in Rotterdam or did you visit there with the idea pre-formed? How did you come to work there and what are the studios like?</strong></p>\n<p>I went there without any ideas or instruments but I was already in that way of thinking I mentioned, so after a few attempts I realised I was doing well and moving in that direction. I was excited both by the incredible sounds those machines could produce and by the quality, in term of integrity, concept and complexity, of the sessions I was producing. The studio (it's just one) is a nice place. You get your keys and you're free to spend as much time there as you want during your residency. I've been using only a part of the Serge Modular and few elements of the ARP2500 but there were many more electronic instruments. I've been playing almost all of them but those two were the only ones I approached with a real interest.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/245085217&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Giuseppe Ielasi mastered the release, who you also produce with as 'Bellows', and have collaborated on a number of other projects... Tell us about your relationship - how did the two of you first meet?</strong></p>\n<p>We met many years ago, before knowing we were both musicians. Lately a lot of people have asked us how a collaboration can last for so long and I always reply that probably it's because we've never pushed it - we've always waited for things to come together naturally without any pressure from us or from the annoying idea of doing releases, searching for gigs or whatever. We produce music when we want to or whenever someone interesting asks us for some new material, we don't have any booking agency, we play gigs when somebody asks and it's worth doing. We also work on other projects concerning sound, such as sound design for art installations, videos and exhibitions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7410/27215752536_a0e883d026_b.jpg\" alt=\"er\"></p>\n<p><em>Nicola Ratti &amp; Giuseppe Ielasi</em></p>\n<p><strong>Is collaboration something that comes naturally to you or do you prefer to work in isolation generally?</strong></p>\n<p>There are different reasons to start a collaboration, I don't have any one in particular  but an interest in some other artist or the feeling of a similar approach and taste. So far I've not been so much into collaborations but I have some coming up now, one is with Jake Meginsky. I've found in his music a way of considering the elements that compose a piece of his in a similar way to mine. We wrote to each other after we shared our last albums and we thought it was reasonable and interesting so we decided to start a collaboration. We met in Milan (I organised his solo concert here) and we decided to go with the idea, without any pressure however.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/204321459&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>You were at FASMA festival the other month I believe, how was it? Was it nice being able to meet some other members of the Where To Now collective at the showcase?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes it was! I met Jesse Osborne-Lanthier and it was nice to spend the evening together and share the stage with him. The crew and the festival were super even if I didn't have the chance to stay in Athens longer than the night of the gig, since the day after I played at Hand-Signed in Florence.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7569/27215746966_f2cf18708e_b.jpg\" alt=\"fasma\"></p>\n<p><em>Nicola Ratti at Fasma 2016</em></p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of festivals, I was reading about Auna on your website. Is this something you help curate? Tell us a bit more about the project...</strong></p>\n<p>Auna is an ongoing project led by many Italian experimental musicians. It was conceived initially as a sharing of our own activities and research, a kind of private gathering that only turned into a mini festival in its second phase, self-organised by the musicians. I organised the second (and last so far) in Milan more than one year ago. Since then I'd say Auna is in stand-by, waiting for other people to set up another meeting.</p>\n<p><strong>Milan seems to have quite a vibrant electronic music scene in general at the moment. Do you feel there has been an uptake in interest in the last few years or has it always been like this?</strong></p>\n<p>It definitely grew in the last 2/3 years but that doesn't mean years ago it was so much less. I guess the step forward came from a multiplicity of promoters and venues that went deeper into specific kinds of experimental music, keeping their activity inside a kind of net - that's good I think. At the same time, concerning the audience, Milan is not a huge city so the number of people really interested in the music is proportionate to it. That's why I rarely complain about the amount of people that come to a show and that's why, trying to be realistic, I've only organised shows that I can afford.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/227519174&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I understand that you have curated some gallery work for 'Standards' in Milan. I imagine you play vastly different music in galleries than say, a club or festival. How do you consider the importance of space? Does it affect the work you put together?</strong></p>\n<p>Absolutely yes. Playing music without considering the meaning and consequences that the sounds you produce have on a specific place - it's like driving a car blindfolded. Talking about my experience there's a tight and unavoidable link between what I'm playing and what I'm listening to. Usually I try to play in front of the PA, it's on my tech rider, but often it's not possible (like when you're playing on stages and so on) so I agree to play with two monitors and it's OK, but I feel half the intensity of the show. I cannot establish a real connection with the sound, I cannot follow its changes inside the room and enjoy what the audience is listening to, trying to consider a concert more like a shared and unique experience than a one-way and repeatable exhibition.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally what's next for yourself? Any interesting projects you are able to tell us about over the rest of the year?</strong></p>\n<p>Actually I'm doing many different things and more are coming. Not all of them are closely  related to my activity as a musician but they are all related to sound, that's what matters to me. I won't bother you with the list of activities I need to fulfill to make a living out of the choices I've made so I'm telling you only the ones you probably care about...</p>\n<p>I'm currently working on some new material that I'd like to become my next album and, as I told you before, I've started a collaboration with Jake Meginsky so we're recording and sharing sessions. I'm awaiting along with Giuseppe, the release of a Bellows' EP and LP from two different labels, hopefully before the end of the year. I'm also curating/promoting a series of events in Milan concerning sound and space such as concerts and sound installations with an art organization I founded with other artists and curators. That's all so far.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/245085234&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>John Cage's seminal work, <em>Silence: Lectures and Writings</em> begins like so: “wherever we are, what we hear is mostly noise. When we ignore it, it disturbs us. When we listen to it, we find it fascinating.” His philosophy of sound was wholly all-encompassing. For Cage, music came not just from the instruments and voices of traditional orchestras and ensembles. Rather, music could be found everywhere, from the whistle of a teapot to screech of a car alarm.</p>\n<p>You may think that the extent to which Cage has influenced Drum &amp; Bass may be rather limited. But Romanian producer DYL  — real name Costea Edward  — follows in his footsteps. &quot;Music is everywhere&quot;, Edward begins, &quot;every single sound from today can be the wicked track of tomorrow.&quot; Unsurprising then, that his productions take indiscriminately from outside sources. Field recordings and sound effects filter through his music, drawing them away from any recognisable 'dancefloor' form. On his <em>Concept</em> EP, Edward reshaped the hallmarks of D&amp;B into features of an ambient soundtrack. The reese bass sounded like wind, the breaks sounded like rain. On <em>Continentia</em>, his unconventional approach went to a yet further extreme, featuring 'PPXXPP', a track designed to be played at two different speeds.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7485/26588379174_d2f61d8099_b.jpg\" alt=\"DYL2\"></p>\n<p>So although there is an undeniable lineage between from UK hardcore and jungle, Edward's productions have always been difficult to compartmentalise. &quot;D&amp;B was the genre where everything started, and from then I tried to eliminate that barrier between D&amp;B and other genres. Alien Pimp from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DubKraftRec/\">Dubkraft Records</a> once told me, &quot;stop labelling, start listening&quot;, and I have been indebted to his advice ever since. There's also something distinctly personal about Edward's productions. &quot;Music has been present every single day of my life (thanks to my parents for that for doing it in the right way)&quot;, he tells me. &quot;It has been with me every single moment of my life until now. It was therefore obvious that one day I would start producing, and when I did, it was like an explosion of something that had been stuck in my chest.&quot;</p>\n<p>When Edward first sent me the audio for this mix, he warned me that it was a &quot;very scary&quot; glimpse into &quot;a bit of my world&quot;. Comprised mostly of Edward's original productions, his anti-genre ethos comes through loud and clear. This is more like a work of mind-bending sound art you might hear in a gallery than a South London club at 5am. Listening back, he described it as sounding like something from &quot;a nightmare monochrome parallel world... kinda like <em>Stray Landings</em>...&quot;</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0064-dyl%2F&hide_cover=1\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Tonje Thilesen</em></p>\n<p>This year saw the release of <em>AFTRYK</em>, the debut 12&quot; from SØS Gunver Ryberg. <em>AFTRYK</em> brought together elements of sound art and techno, creating a record that was too weird for dance-floors, yet too lively for an art exhibition. Given her musical genealogy, this ought not to come as a surprise. Indeed, this 12&quot; was but an anomaly amongst a litany of other projects that she describes as the &quot;ephemeral expression of music&quot;. Her past projects include concerts, computer game soundtracks, and sound installations. A background in arts such as these has been consequently crucial in the formation of her sound. ‘1170 Siva (Bare Bones)’ in particular stands out as a landmark piece. Having existed in various forms for at least two years, this oddball sound experiment was meticulously designed to induce panic attacks and nightmares.</p>\n<p>Her live shows are also renowned. In 2014, she gained a considerable audience following her appearance on Objekt's Boiler Room showcase. Since then, she has become a favourite on Europe's summer festival circuit. This is perhaps to be expected given the undeniable 'live quality' that infuses her music. One cannot decouple the sounds she creates with the space that they were intended for. They are, in her words, 'site specific', from the microscopic to the titanic. Like her recorded music, her shows are typically terrifying: frenetic drum machines and murky drones bleed through a wall of chaotic overdrive. But given the aggressive power in her productions, she is far from the the anti-social character one might assume. To the contrary, earlier this month we had the immense pleasure of chatting to her about coal mines, algorithms and George Bataille.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/243873795&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>So to kick things off, how has 2016 been for you so far?</strong></p>\n<p>This year so far has been a blast for me. I released my first record on Contort in January have been busy with two theatre productions, another video game called ‘THOTH’ coming out later 2016 as well as developing my live sets.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about how you got involved with Contort in the first place? Did you know Hayley &amp; Samuel Kerridge from before?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s been absolutely amazing to meet them. A friend showed them my website. They contacted me asking if I was interested in performing with Contort show at Urban Spree in Berlin. They then asked if I was interested in performing at ATONAL in August 2014, for their Sunday showcase, and after that they asked about the release. I’m very grateful for their support.</p>\n<p><strong>We love the artwork for that release. Where is it from? Did you have input on it?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s created by the artist Anthony Gerace. Contort are working with him on the different releases. The tactile 3D feel he created on the cover is really cool. My input for the artwork is the postcard inside. It’s a picture I took in 2009 from the inside of a coal mine in an arctic mountain. It shows the footprints of a Pantodont (a 60 million year old mammal)...</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7134/27460010695_337277e42e_b.jpg\" alt=\"art2\"></p>\n<p><strong>Can you give us a quick description of your typical working process? To me it sounds as if a lot of what you write comes out of organic and spontaneous improvisations.</strong></p>\n<p>My process is evolving. It has to be very dynamic. Most of the elements that are on <em>AFTRYK</em> I created for my live sets. Only 'Pantodont' was created as a track for the EP. I’m setting up different ways to be live in my recordings and I’m also working with algorithms to create subtle variation. I don’t want to get lost in the editing maze.</p>\n<p><strong>So does this infiltrate how you play live?</strong></p>\n<p>I try to produce as much new material as possible for each of my performances. In the performance I work with these new elements. From my experience, performing with all theses various elements, I get a feel for the flow and new ideas of how to create various material into a track.</p>\n<p><strong>You also played Intonal festival this year right? How was that?</strong></p>\n<p>Intonal was a great experience. I really appreciated the varied program of the festival, the ambiance and the team behind it all were super professional.</p>\n<p><strong>I understand that you're also playing at Denmark's STRØM festival in August too.</strong></p>\n<p>Yes - the organization behind STRØM are doing hell of a lot work and new initiatives for the electronic scene right now. It’s very exciting what this will bring.</p>\n<p><strong>You've had an interesting history of live performances. It seems like you have been making and disseminating music for a long time, but you have only just released your debut record. If you’ll excuse my impatience, what took you so long?</strong></p>\n<p>I have been focused on the ephemeral expression of music; through installations, concerts, site specific multi-channel pieces and so on. So in this way, how I have ‘released’ my music is very hard to document. I reached a point where I felt a physical media release was important as a next step. I feel like it’s important to express my music in these various ways.</p>\n<p><strong>I heard that Trade (the Surgeon &amp; Blawan project) have decided to exist only as a live performance. I like that idea, that you can only experience their music in a live setting. Is releasing music something that you’re looking to pursue more of in the future, or do you prefer working solely as a live musician?</strong></p>\n<p>I will for sure release more. I’m really looking forward to have more time to concentrate on this again. I also consider other productions such as video games as a sort of release. It’s just another format and a cooperation with other artists and media.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you get involved in making music for computer games in the first place?</strong></p>\n<p>The video game ‘INSIDE’ from Playdead is the first time I tried creating for the video game format. You work in a team, it’s a non-linear composition, with many technical limitations. I worked together with composer and sound designer Martin Stig Andersen who created audio for their previous game ‘LIMBO’. He knows my work and I got more and more involved with ‘INSIDE’. He functioned as the audio director and throughout the three years I was working on the project, I had freedom to experiment and create. The expression of the game is very minimalistic and detailed as you can hear from the trailer.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/96582546?byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>Do you therefore consider yourself more of a sound artist, or a musician? Is there a difference?</strong></p>\n<p>Sound design is part of being an electronic musician, whether that's as a sound artist, composer or producer. We are always designing sounds. My music are sounds and my sounds are music.</p>\n<p><strong>I really liked those mini loop pieces you gave out for free on Resident Advisor. I imagine you have hundreds of those loops that have never been used. Do you have a back-catalogue of music that is yet to be released? Will it ever see the light?</strong></p>\n<p>For RA I made <a href=\"(https://residentadvisor.wetransfer.com/downloads/fda61f142c40b3129e39efb4cf547b1f20160329104950/8c263c)\">something different</a> than I’m use to, as I don’t normally work with loops but long takes. I have a seriously crazy amount of recordings on so many hard drives. I always wish that I had time to finish some of those recordings. I rarely open old projects, but when I discover sounds I recorded years ago which surprises me, I love that.</p>\n<p><strong>We’re all very eager to here what you have coming up next. Any hints you can give away?</strong></p>\n<p>I have some concerts around Europe this summer. Hopefully I will also be able to work on the next release. Right now I have a theater performance in Denmark. I’m on stage as a normal performer and also creating and performing the music. We are staging “Story of the Eye” by Georges Bataille which explores eroticism, mysticism, surrealism, and transgression. Then I’m looking forward to the release of  two video games: ‘INSIDE’ by Playdead and ‘THOTH’ by Carlsen Games. The ‘THOTH’ sound design and music are created by SGR^CAV, the collaboration I have with Cristian Vogel. Both games are worth checking out <em>even</em> if you are not a gamer...</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/35111178&color=0f0e0e&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>It's hard to imagine there has been a single dull moment across the career on Minneapolis raised Bryan Black, aka Black Asteroid. Initially studying as a graphic designer, Black leaped from one success to another as his industrial-rock outfit Haloblack was picked up by Prince, leading to him becoming a sound designer and keyboard technician for the seminal artist.</p>\n<p>Subsequently Black also formed Motor, a project aimed at addressing techno's increasingly formulaic sound. Over the last few years however he has been performing as Black Asteroid, a pursuit somewhere between the booming hedonism of CLR (a label which has been notably supportive of the project) branded techno, and the futuristic pop of '80s new-wave and industrial scenes.</p>\n<p>With a performance at Fabric coming up on the <a href=\"https://www.fabriclondon.com/club/listing/1276\">11th</a> alongside Mote Evolver's Luke Slater, we invited Black to contribute to our 'That Time When' series. The gig's discussed span from the early '90s to the late 2000s, from his experiences in outfits such as Motor and Haloblack, through to working with the late, great Prince - or 'sir' as he was known to Black at the time owing to the fact his legal name was just a symbol...</p>\n<p>###1 Prince at Paisley Park_1995</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7310/27378011542_0afd8c9180_z.jpg\" alt=\"x\"></p>\n<p>I was recently hired as a keyboard tech for Prince and his band, the NPG. At the time Prince would throw impromptu live gigs during the week on the soundstage at Paisley Park in Chanhassen, Minnesota.</p>\n<p>I was standing on the side of the stage making sure the keyboards were working, the samplers were triggering the right sound banks, etc. Prince managed to break a couple of keys on one of the keyboards and looked over at me. I immediately ran to the basement and fetched a backup keyboard. As I’m making my way back to the soundstage I glance at the garage full of iconic prince cars and then near the elevator I walk past the infamous vault.</p>\n<p>As soon as I swapped out the keyboards, I proceeded to open up the broken one and replace the broken keys and get back to my job.  He played for hours and hours, I think there were about 100 people there. It was a Tuesday.</p>\n<p>###2 Nine Inch Nails at First Avenue, Minneapolis_1990</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7502/26867963814_3424db3213_b.jpg\" alt=\"a\"></p>\n<p>I was underage but somehow managed to sneak in when the bouncers weren’t looking. NIN was the support act for Peter Murphy. The first NIN LP just came out and it blew my mind. I will never forget the smell of beer and then seeing NIN trash the stage and completely upstage Peter Murphy. I met Trent briefly before the show. He had sweaty hands.</p>\n<p>###3 Motor supporting Depeche Mode in Europe_2009/10</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7527/27378010972_bcd7374222_b.jpg\" alt=\"q\"></p>\n<p>My band MOTOR we signed to Mute records, and Martin Gore I found out was a fan of the singles we had released. We got approached to remix 'Precious' and then by chance I met Martin Gore in NYC. A few days later we were invited to open for Depeche Mode in Europe. Every show was in an outdoor football stadium, rain or shine. I never felt so nervous in my life. But the exhilaration of performing for 50,000 people and walking down Dave Gahan’s little runway into the audience will never be forgotten. Also the catering was insane.  By this time the band members were clean and sober and had life coaches on the road with them. Not the rock and roll experience I had read about from previous tours, but they were super nice and accommodating.</p>\n<p>###4 Daft Punk at Pukkelpop Belgium_2006</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7522/27442826456_4ac2f57aed_b.jpg\" alt=\"o\"></p>\n<p>I had just finished performing as 'MOTOR' (my project before Black Asteroid) and made my way over to the main stage to see Daft Punk. As soon as I saw the pyramid light up I knew this was something special. Still the most captivating dance music display I have seen.</p>\n<p>###5 Haloblack at Paisley Park_1995</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7518/27200451540_e539d4fd70_b.jpg\" alt=\"s\"></p>\n<p>My first band Haloblack had just starting gigging around town. One of Prince’s people invited us to perform at one of his dance parties at Paisley Park. I was told he wasn't there, but later learned he was watching. After the gig, I got offered a job with Prince. Seeing Purple Rain was the catalyst for me to start making music.  By the time I started working for him, he didn't have a name, so I called him ‘Sir’.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/216081095&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Mathilde Chambon</em></p>\n<p>Kansas City producer Huerco S – otherwise known as Brian Leeds – is recognised for his take on dusty minimal techno tinged with industrial, folky midwestern influences, as exemplified in his 2013 debut album <em>Colonial Patterns</em>. His sophomore release conversely forgoes his previously more dance-floor ready sound, for a spellbindingly hypnotic and meditative ambient album. Last year’s brilliant <em>Railroad Blues EP</em> hinted at what was to come with the sublime, expansively ambient cut of ‘Rushing to Paradise’, and this sound is developed into an exemplary and fully realised record in his latest and most intimate work.</p>\n<p>As the enigmatically phrased title alludes this is Huerco S’s most personal release yet, and the sweeping scope of the record concerns itself with love and relationships – it's an evocative, emotionally fragile and candid exploration of the dichotomy between its (mis)perceived ideality and its devastating decline. ‘A Sea of Love’ washes over you with the soaring, billowing abundance of this heightened sense of reality; later on, in its more serrated and spectral moments, it is disillusionment with the very death of this desire which is at effect, ruminating over the remnants of something once so visceral. The melancholic chimes in ‘Hear Me Out’ resonate inchoately, hesitantly attempting to realise a rhythm through repetition, yet the sound remains sparse. Throughout the record soothing, mellifluous soundscapes glide gently along – this rose-tinted tranquility is at times interspersed with sonic spaces which herald a more discordant sound – anticipating a sense of emptiness and dread which is not quite tangible, something which lies just out of frame.</p>\n<p>The record’s monolithic, undeviating swathes of sound create a dense infrastructure, yet this constancy also constructs a certain low-lit warmth and intimacy. ‘Lifeblood (Naive Melody)’ is a psychedelic, undulating meditation on desire; ‘Kraanvogel’s blurry industrial landscape is dissonant and textured. This is a fully immersive record which has been crafted with care, and thus merits a special form of attentiveness from the listener. By languidly moving in and through the hazy drifts of consciousness, Leeds has mentioned that its themes involve an intensely personal exploration of the highs and lows of love in all its forms - from the thrall of devotion to the anxiety of freedom, to navigating the self through the eyes of the other, and just how much of this is necessary before you become fully subsumed. It’s easy to see that there’s a lot more going on here than background music. The record deftly traverses the interior realms of waking life, uncovering the shadowy secrets that lie just below the surface, whilst its panoramic soundscapes are slowly built up until they soar high above ground.</p>\n<p>Leeds cites his varied influences for the record including 90s German techno and Japanese ambient composers like Hiroshi Yoshimura, whose dreamy, delicate soundscapes are not far off from Leeds’ own nebulous creations here. The record’s standout is the gorgeously crafted, otherworldly ‘Promises of Fertility’, its sweet melody exquisite in its melancholic beauty, wavering on the vertiginous precipice between tentative hope and absolute despair that the heady rush of intoxicating love can often bring. ‘The Sacred Dance’s blissfully paradisiacal melody closes the record off in a dreamy, ethereal maelstrom of amorous, exhilarating feeling. <em>For Those Of You Have Never (And Also Those Who Have)</em> is an intensely introspective, hypnagogic record made to be played on repeat: for when you’re on a quiet commute, drifting to sleep, or simply just awake in the early hours of the night with your troubled thoughts running wild.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/265512371&amp;color=aaaf09&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Peder Mannerfelt's eponymous label is fast becoming a leader in championing new talent in the world of avante-electronics. The imprint provided the breakthrough EP from Anna Vtorova aka Machine Woman, as well as an early release from now Editions Mego signed Klara Lewis alongside assorted Mannerfelt self-releases. The latest act to feature on the label is Sissel Wincent, a Swedish artist with an ear for the same heat-warped electronics and tin-drum polyrhythms which typify Mannerfelt's own releases.</p>\n<p>Similarly to these, and indeed Machine Woman's release for the label, the 'Illusion of Randomness' EP has an unpolished feel, as if a number of modular's had been left on at the end of a live set - left to bleep on into the small-hours. Take 'Monstera' for example, firing off wild laser blasts of static and flanger, creating a hypnotic assault on the senses. 'As If' on the other hand barks dalek vocals over roughshod skin drums and off-kilter melodies which feel as if they are being plucked out on an elastic band.</p>\n<p>There is something ritualistic in Wincent's crawling rhythms, and similarly something very Radiophonic Workshop at the same time. 'Investigation' continues on from the previous track almost seamlessly, before thudding kick drums hint at something more dancefloor oriented. The build is slow and unrelenting, only reaching a partial climax leaving the listener suspended in anticipation.</p>\n<p>This said, at choice moments Wincent does step full-heartedly into the realms of danceable techno. The stuttered resonances of 'Chrome' is case in point. The track is almost reminiscent of Objekt's formidable beat experiments, tremoring rumbles of low-end providing firm foundation beneath Wincent's relentless single note motif - like a recurring error message on an outdated PC.</p>\n<p>Yet again Mannerfelt has done an excellent job of capturing an artist at their most raw and creative - the catalog of releases here being almost Modal Analysis like in terms of aesthetic but with a more playful, freeform feel. Here's to hoping there's plenty more discoveries on the horizon.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/264563150%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-4nnAz&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>The topic of Stockholm's EMS studio has come up a few times this year. They helped curate this year's Intonal Festival in Sweden and I also spent time discussing the uniqueness of the space in an interview with Raster-Noton artist, <a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/interviews/noise-between-machines-kyoka-interview\">Kyoka</a> who attended sessions there in the creation of her 'SH' EP. A month or so ago the name came up again when I was presented with this rather intriguing selection of organically-textured electronics from Copenhagen based sound-artist, Lars Lundehave Hansen. <em>Terminal Velocity</em> is Hansen's debut album (under his birth name at least), and was recorded at the EMS studio across mid-to-late 2014.</p>\n<p>Asking Hansen about the impact working at the studio had on the overall sound of the release, he stated it was the &quot;ability to work at a place that lets you focus so much&quot; that was most defining of the experience, spending three months in Stockholm where he &quot;didn't have to think of anything else but how to go about making music.&quot; Quizzed further he revealed: &quot;I wasn't even required to actually make a record, only to focus on my work and to explore and expand the fields and limits of my musical approach.&quot;</p>\n<p>Looking over Hansen's CV, the number of exhibition spaces he has worked in is rather high, and this should come as no surprise given the gallery-friendly soundscapes presented across <em>Terminal Velocity</em>. Take 'Muted Enthusiasm' for example. Warbling dial-up hum and slowly crescendo-ing arctic drones weave between one another, calling to mind the meditative tonal experiments of an artist like Biosphere. Across 'Burst' super-stretched choral motifs and pressure-blasts of noise grapple against one another fiercely.</p>\n<p>Considering the album is 21 tracks long with offerings barely ever reaching the three minute mark, the intensity Hansen manages to reach from track to track is really rather impressive. At moments <em>Terminal Velocity</em> calls to mind Jed Kerzel's soundtrack to angst-ridden John Bunting biopic <em>Snowtown</em>, so forceful are its narratives. Take 'Disadvantage Point' for example, shuddering amp-driven chords and screeching harmonics hurtle alongside one another like two burning meteors flying through space.  'Life Explodes' on the other hand flirts with Sunn O))) style doom metal, gritten chords slamming down in an impenetrable wall. An almost identical riff is played in a notably more subdued fashion a few tracks later, 'Not Everything Is Going To Be All Right' closing the LP with discordant modular abstractions.</p>\n<p>Having not heard a great deal from Hansen prior to <em>Terminal Velocity</em>, the album makes a rather sizeable first blip on my radar for the artist. It also begs the question; if this is Hansen's debut, what giddy height might a second album reach?</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/228206283&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Grischa Lichtenberger is not an artist I would have thought well suited to collaboration. Stylistically, he is often compared to Autechre, although I have always thought of his productions as existing completely in a sphere of their own. Tropes of Glitch and EDM are forced through a mesh of ultra-computerised processing. Given the highly unique and also often conceptual nature of his work, it can be difficult to imagine his sound jelling effectively with another artists.</p>\n<p>Casually proving me wrong however, comes ‘Conversations Sur Lettres Mortes’ (or ‘CSLM’ for those short on time). The Cosmo Rhythmatic released EP sees Lichtenberger team up with Where To Now? affiliate Jess Osborne-Lanthier. Based in Montreal (where the collaboration was formed), Osborne-Lanthier on the other hand definitely isn't short of collaborations to date. Alongside working in groups like Femminielli Noir and Mor†, he has also co-released with everyone from Raster-Noton legend Robert Lippok, to Hobo Cult founder Francesco De Gallo.</p>\n<p>'CSLM' is derived from several live shows Lichtenberger and Osborne-Lanthier put together for Mutek in 2014. The duo used cathode-ray TV sets and VHS units to create an array of churning rhythmic experiments, both dense and complex. Take the groaning ‘Comcast’ for example, creaking like the bows of a ship caught in a heavy storm. ‘Good Morning America’ on the other hand feels like trying to walk across a thick layer of PVA glue - disjointed percussion and sandpaper-like blasts of static firing off at awkward intervals.</p>\n<p>Considering the EP enjoys such a consistent tonal palette, it is impressive that the duo manage to explore such a wide range of tempos at the same time. ’4% (Maurice)’ darts forward with jackhammer kicks and single note glitches building in tension incessantly. Opener ‘CRT Creeper’ on the other hand plods forward aimlessly, both languid and imposing.</p>\n<p>The EP also features remixes from a selection of similarly highly-acclaimed sound-manipulators. In Paradisum breakthrough Low Jack turns ‘CRT Creeper’ into a thundering cacophony of almost footwork style drums, while Hungarian artist Gábor Lázár and Tri Angle’s Rabit attempt to outdo each other with increasingly abstract takes on ‘Good Morning America’ &amp; ‘4% (Maurice)’.</p>\n<p>Arguably the remixes don’t add a massive amount to the release, however placed in the b-side they make a nice bonus offering for those looking for some variations on the originals. The also certainly don’t detract from collaboration, which sees Lichtenberger at his most raw and uncompromising, and Osborne-Lanthier at his most frenzied.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/164030470?color=ffffff&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><a href=\"http://www.straylandings.co.uk/articles/87620066723\">SonuoS</a>: perhaps the only label in the world that professes to deal exclusively with music between 35 and 80 BPM. A tempo range that many of us would consider murky and unfamiliar territory. How can you feel a rhythm that's but a quarter of your pulse? This is a label pushed to the extremes. Yet this is precisely the kind of obscurantism that its label boss Finn Albertsson craves. Take for example, Albertsson's mammoth 150-minute <a href=\"http://www.straylandings.co.uk/podcasts/98463333613\">dub podcast for Stray Landings</a>, or his reputation as someone who gets less than four hours sleep a night (&quot;remember you can sleep in your grave&quot; is something he often reminds me). Indeed, this extreme approach extends to its latest arrival: A.O.T's <em>Rundgång EP</em>, the previews of which have been up for no less than three years. Yet the wait has been worth it, and it still sounds as as it did in 2013: completely unhinged.</p>\n<p>We begin at the deep end. Title track ‘Rundgång’ transports you to another planet, with jittering glitches and percussive bleeps that sound like an alien broadcast. It's grime music transmitted from the future, put in a code impossible to decipher. Uncanny voices from an artificial source narrate your journey, teaching you (amongst other things) the Swedish word for 'bass', as if lifted directly from a 'teach yourself DJ chat' language audiobook. And at 11-minutes, it's an enduring trip. But resolution or conclusion are never given: this strange equation is best left unsolved. ‘Woot!’ is a joyfully chaotic experiment, mashing squelchy synths with a toy-box of effects processing. Unlike ‘Rundgång’, this sees an obvious and ever-growing progression with every rush of noise. Go Koyashiki's remix of ‘Rundgång’ also contributes something far more sinister. Airy pulses of noise fill the stereo-field amidst the tick-tock of a Geiger counter. We even see the welcome but surprising introduction of a mournful piano, a ‘quiet after the storm’: colouring the mood in cinematic sepia.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/99905543&color=040404&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Mary Velo has a fierce and unrestrained back-catalogue of warehouse thumpers behind her. The Toronto-raised producer has made notable impacts on labels such as Frozen Border and Att Series, disoriented 4/4 and twisting, discordant melodies perfectly suited to mind-bending, early-hour trips. As a DJ herself, Velo has become well-versed at creating music which balances functionality with densely interwoven melodic textures.</p>\n<p>Her latest excursion comes in the form of 'The Examination Of Witnesses' EP,  which as the title suggests could easily soundtrack the latest colour-drained Nordic detective series. Alongside the stuttered hi-hats, thudding bass and clattered snares, Velo deploys ghostly swathes of ambience, and reverberant industrial sonic oddities.</p>\n<p>With the release having been out for several months and an upcoming 12&quot; split with Advanced Human and Headless Horseman, we decided to invite Velo to contribute to our That Time When series, discussing five of her most memorable gigging experiences.</p>\n<p>###1 Mary Velo at Berghain_2014</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7360/27888680306_51f72c7fa8_b.jpg\" alt=\"b\"></p>\n<p>I remember when first time I was asked to play at Berghain, I was so excited I was literally shaking! It’s the best club in the world in my opinion and I was going to play there. I was unable to sleep for weeks. I was nervous that something would stop working or I would have a heart attack! When the day finally came, I was lucky enough to have one of the best set times - 7pm on the Sunday, right before Rodhad. During my set, I was just thinking how cool it is to see the club and people from the DJ booth. I realised I was nervous for no reason as it was my best DJ set ever! It was packed, everyone was into it and so was I. I basically just said to myself 'it can’t get any better than this'.</p>\n<p>###2 Mary Velo at Mercat/Bunker, Melbourne_2014</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7536/27888679196_0570603629_b.jpg\" alt=\"q\"></p>\n<p>The Bunker crew from Melbourne are a great bunch promoting techno all the way in Australia. They asked me to come down and play. I have never been to Australia due to the fact I didn’t think I could survive the long plane ride, as well as those huge spiders you hear about over there. So not only was I excited about DJing in Australia, but this was maybe the only time I could go there.  So around 30 hours later, I landed in Melbourne during the day, hung out in the city and played the same night. I thought maybe I should sleep, but I just couldn’t. Later that night the bunker guys and I went out for dinner and drinks. I had this fancy coconut with an umbrella and I felt ready to party! It was four hours and I loved every minute of it! Everyone there was so friendly and there’s a really good scene over there! I loved Melbourne so much and can’t wait to go back there!</p>\n<p>###3 Depeche Mode at Molson Amphitheatre, Toronto_2001</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7450/27888679576_e93ece74ee_z.jpg\" alt=\"a\"></p>\n<p>I fell in love with Depeche Mode in the early '80s but never got to see them live until 2001. That’s a pretty long time not seeing your favourite band! I don’t know why I didn't see them earlier but I heard they were coming to Toronto and quickly got a ticket. The venue was the Molson Amphitheatre which is outdoors, the sound was not the greatest because of this but the show they put on was breathtaking! They had an amazing set up and the visuals were beautiful. Martin [Gore] was looking so cute wearing his white wings! I have seen Depeche Mode a few times since, and each time I'm in awe, but this was the best show I have ever been to. If you have never been to a Depeche Mode concert, I strongly recommend it!</p>\n<p>###4 Motörhead at The Warehouse_2000</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7300/27888679906_2d15e0e149_z.jpg\" alt=\"m\"></p>\n<p>Oh Motörhead... I never considered myself a huge fan until I saw them play live back in June of 2000. The only reason I went to see them was that\nmy friends were going and they had an extra ticket. I figured I should join them, and I was so glad I did!</p>\n<p>The opening band 'Nashville Pussy' - they were playing really hard. Their music is described as 'psychobilly, southern rock, cowpunk and sleaze rock'. I was really into punk back in 2000... Motörhead finally came on and I was up in front when the mosh pit started, but I had these huge guys behind me who I felt were protecting me, which was great considering my size. So I was right under Lemmy, man he is such a bad ass! The whole atmosphere was different from the other punk/rock shows I've been to which in general had a younger crowd. Most of the people there were older and it felt like what a real punk/rock show should be like. RIP Lemmy!</p>\n<p>###5 Madonna at Air Canada Center_2005</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7393/27888679376_cf4ef5d131_b.jpg\" alt=\"p\"></p>\n<p>I decided to include the show that disappointed me the most - Madonna in October 2005, in Toronto. I must admit, I grew up listening to Madonna in the '80s and '90s and sadly didn't get to see her during her good days.</p>\n<p>So there I was thinking this was going to be her last ever concert… I wanted to get the best seats I could no matter how much it cost. So $300 later, I got a space on the first row to the side. I had to go alone because none of my friends cared about her.</p>\n<p>There's not much I can say about the show, except that it was my most expensive, disappointing and boring concert ever. After watching her earlier shows from the '90s on video, you can see that she really has changed a lot... for the worse. At this one everything just seemed superficial and cheesy. I should have saved my money!</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/221067568&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p>The talent pool for sonically challenging electronic music seems to be remarkably strong in Sweden at the moment. As well as imprints like Kontra Musik, Stockholm_LTD and Skudge Records who have been waving the avante-techno flag for years, recently Peder Mannerfelt has also been pushing the envelope with his own, eponymously titled label. Following on the heels of Machine Woman's stunning 'For Sweden' EP, Mannerfelt looked to fellow Swede Sissel Wincent for the latest offering on the label.</p>\n<p>Although the 'Illusion of Randomness' 12&quot; makes up her debut release, Wincent has actually been exploring the leftfield sonic spectrum for some time now. She is a member of the Drömfakulteten for example, a Swedish collective aimed at promoting female and transgender artists. She also performed at Norberg Festival last year, a volunteer led event held in a historic Iron ore mining town. Last year Wincent DJed across their morning ambient sessions, and will be rejoining the festival this year with a specially prepared live set.</p>\n<p>With the performance less than a month away and 'Illusion of Randomness' released recently, we decided to catch up with Wincent to discuss sampling her own voice in her productions, playing at Norberg and taking over the world with Drömfakulteten.</p>\n<p><strong>Hi Sissel, first off how are things? The ‘Illusion of Randomness’ EP came out recently – what was your first contact with Peder and how long was the release in the works for?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s great, its kind of summer and I bike back and forth to the studio from different places. I'm currently listening to HAJ300 while she prepares a new live set.</p>\n<p>I discovered Peder’s music a couple of years ago through a video where 'Psalms and Songs and Voices' was playing. It’s still a favourite. Sometime last year I got in contact with Machine Woman, and then she played here at Swedish Radio's 'Arts Birthday Party' where my crew was playing too. She introduced me to Peder, who had found my music through her. That was in late January and I think I worked on the tracks until March or April.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/264563155&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Is it your own vocals which feature through the EP? How did you go about sourcing sounds for the release?</strong></p>\n<p>It's my own voice, I was really sceptical about using it until I got asked if I used my voice in my productions. Then I thought, why not? I went straight into the studio and recorded 'As If' as well as a messy gabber-ish track. Now it seems stupid not to use my voice, since it's a decent instrument.</p>\n<p>For the other sounds, it's a mash up of hardware and different recordings I’ve made. Everything from streaming water to mechanics and objects thrown into a concrete silo. Both processed and unprocessed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7391/27986687886_c56d3a48ae_b.jpg\" alt=\"e\"></p>\n<p><strong>Although it’s your debut release as far as I can tell, your Soundcloud account suggests you’ve been producing for a while. How did you first get interested in producing electronic music?</strong></p>\n<p>I’ve been listening to electronic music for about ten years now, and what I obviously needed to start producing was a dedicated space and supportive friends who let me do what I wanted to do in my own pace and way.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/242249611&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Did you have other musical projects previously (playing in bands etc)? What kind of sounds were you interested in growing up?</strong></p>\n<p>I was assigned to play flute in a school orchestra when I was nine, and then I did it for an additional year until I dropped out. So yeah, this is my first project.</p>\n<p>I don’t think I was interested by special sounds, more the vibe, energy and a sense of something vital. My father would go into record stores and buy CDs on a recommendation, so there was a variety of different things at home. I remember a collection of dub, which stood out from the rest. I probably listened to that more than he did.</p>\n<p>The first CD I got was AQUA 'Aquarium'. After the pop years I was into punk and rock for a while in my early teens, but got tired of it. There was like two years where I wasn’t listening to any particular music at all, until someone played 'Slagsmålsklubben' and I was like ‘what's this!’ It was a completely new sound for me. I also listened to a lot of The Knife after that. Later on I went to clubs as Kruthuset and The Office which led me into techno and house.</p>\n<p><strong>You are part of the ‘Drömfakulteten’ collective – aimed at promoting female and transgender artists. Can you tell us a bit more about the project? How have they supported your own work for example?</strong></p>\n<p>We are about ten people sharing a studio. We support each other in a lot of ways. We’re friends who are producing music together, DJing, working in 3D, arranging shows, visuals, architecture etc. We hang out together, party together and make crazy plans about how to take over the world. We’re constantly moving in new directions, members are changing and so are our methods. I like how we can give and get feedback constantly, how someone can come in and tell you how good something sounds while you work on it. You can't have that if you're in a space all alone. Drömfakulteten has also got me and the others the opportunity to play live early on, not to get stuck in production only.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7310/27982597452_624e60bb87_b.jpg\" alt=\"q\"></p>\n<p><em>Drömfakulteten Live at Arts Birthday Party</em></p>\n<p><strong>You mention DJing for Drömfakulteten. How do your selections as a DJ differ from the music you compose? When you’re writing tracks do you consider its functionality for the dancefloor or is this not such a concern?</strong></p>\n<p>The best part during my last DJ set was when I only played tunes with a tempo around 140-150 BPM. I do quite a lot of genre hopping, and I’m currently listening to a lot of acidic stuff.</p>\n<p>When I started to produce I wanted to make dance music, and then it just went into something else. It’s a much slower pace than most of the stuff I’m listening to, but I’m speeding up. I don’t aim for my music to be dance music, but I also don’t aim for it not to be. It is what it is.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/264563140&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>How do you find living in Stockholm more generally? It seems to have quite a vibrant scene for experimental electronic music at the moment.</strong></p>\n<p>There are a lot of talented people here who are producing, making parties, hosting live shows, running labels and everything around it. Big up to them for making Stockholm a better place to live in!</p>\n<p><strong>I saw you played at previous editions of Norberg Festival. What do you remember most about the experience last time?</strong></p>\n<p>It was my first time at Norberg Festival last year, and for me that huge concrete cube was the best place to finally grasp the more experimental side of electronic music. That kind of music is the perfect warm up for the more unconventional club music played at the other two stages. I like how two kinds of scenes can exist at the same place and influence each other.</p>\n<p>I'm currently working on a new live set for Norberg. I’m going to perform with visual artist Jakob Jennerholm Hammar. Apart from that I’m looking forward to discovering new acts and seeing TMRW, Peder [Mannerfelt], Pan Daijing and DJ Stingray just to mention a few.</p>\n<p><em>Catch Wincent at Norberg Festival between the 28 - 30 July.

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Ilme Vysniauskaite</em></p>\n<p>Things have changed somewhat since SM-LL graduated from digital to vinyl and lathe formats. Their early releases, the 'Default' series, were mainly reserved for the assorted projects of label owners Martin J Thompson and Lucia H Chung. These days however, there are new faces at every turn. Danish duo R.E.C, Belgian artist Yves De Mey and Japanese producer Durusin have all made appearances on the label. The latest release comes in the form of a new project from Kaj Duncan David, AND REA.</p>\n<p>As well as being a new project, David's AND REA 12&quot; for SM-LL also makes up his first physical release, previous endeavours restricted to live performances and installations for galleries, lecture halls and festivals.</p>\n<p>The first of SM-LL's 'Batch' series was comprised of a single track, cut at full and half speed on either side of the record. Furthermore, listeners were encouraged to play the lathe at both 45rpm and 33rpm, highlighting the versatility that can be found in a single piece.</p>\n<p>David's contribution to the series, takes this idea to greater extremes. Haywire step sequencers and discordant staccato tones are played at both varying speeds and in varying formulations. Across opener 'q+b' for example, computerised bleeps are cautiously set in motion, like 2001's HAL in reboot mode. It's successor, 'QB', on the other hand presents the same repetitions in an altogether more frenetic manner. Pointed blasts of low end interject mid-loop, while bug-eyed bleeps and squelches fight for space at grating pitches.</p>\n<p>As you might expect, 's+g' and 'SG' are similarly linked. In this instance it is 's+g' which comprises the more energy charged of the two, hyper speed arpeggios and paranoid glitches calling to mind Vladislav Delay and Max Loderbauer's assorted footwork experiments as Heisenberg. 'SG' takes a more muted approach, plodding forward with dullen square waves and ticking hi-end.</p>\n<p>SM-LL seem to be finding new nuances to explore at every turn, while still maintaining a  set of core values. Minimalism, a focus on tonality and experiments in subtly shifting polyrhythms are strongly audible here for example, yet David also manages to create a release which cuts against the grain with its frantic tempos and tightly regimented step sequencers.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/269288012&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>- HAU2 - CTM Festival  2015. Photo by Fausto Caricato.</em></p>\n<p>In the early 2000s, Iranian artist Ata Ebtekar was picked up by Warp Records. His debut saw the two high-charged percussive assaults, 'Electric Deaf' and 'Subconscious (Pure Mix)' under the name Sote. The record navigated away from the more conceptual releases Warp had been exploring around the time, instead slamming the listener with redlining kicks and shuddering reece basslines. As one Discogs user put it, the loudness of the record &quot;freaked more than a few people out&quot;.</p>\n<p>A number of other Sote releases followed, but between 2007-2014, things went somewhat quiet in terms of recorded works. This is not to say he was in quiet retreat however. Ebtekar also works as a lecturer and installation artist, and has produced sound and installation art for numerous galleries in San Francisco, the City in which he studied Audio Engineering. One project involved creating a sound sculpture for the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco with Ala Ebtkebar, another creating multi-channel sound art from manipulated recordings of protest chants during various demonstrations in the 1978/79 Iranian Revolution.</p>\n<p>In 2014, record's from under the Sote name started re-emerging, and the past two years this trend has continued - a drone/experimental Opal Tapes cassette, 'Hardcore Sounds From Tehran' released earlier this year. Despite a general move away from dancefloor sounds in more recent years, it is Ebtekar's breakneck hardcore/techno experiments which make up his latest release. 'Neuroenhancer' and 'In Music I Trust' were written in the late '90s, Shapednoise fronted Repitch Recordings seeing fit to bring them to light nearly two decades since they were first written.</p>\n<p>With the 10&quot; released late last month, we decided to invite Ebtekar to contribute to our 'That Time When' series, discussing five of his most memorable gigging experiences. His selections snapshot various moments in the history of Iranian music, both present and past.</p>\n<p>###1 Mohsen Namjoo in San Francisco_Circa-2008</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7559/27444753713_a1f8c2ef5f_z.jpg\" alt=\"m\"></p>\n<p>Mohsen Namjoo is an exiled Iranian composer, singer, songwriter and music scholar who has been based in California since before the mid-2000s. During one of his first concerts outside of Iran, he took me on an emotional journey in which I cried and laughed from one minute to the next. I was amazed by his artistry and effortless mastery of combining classical and modern Persian poetry with rock, jazz, blues and traditional Iranian music, making up a new form of music, which in my opinion is absolutely timeless. His performances are avant-garde operas for people from a wide range of backgrounds…</p>\n<p>To me, he represents Hardcore in its purest form.</p>\n<p>###2 Googoosh in Northern California_Circa-2000</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7372/27444753763_5b86dc5de8_b.jpg\" alt=\"g\"></p>\n<p>The Iranian Revolution happened in 1979. Most pop singers actively working during the previous regime left Iran, with the majority migrating to Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Googoosh, an iconic pop star stayed in Iran. She didn't perform again for twenty years due to restrictions on female singers performing in public.\nFast-forward to 2000 where she sings publicly for the first time in two decades…</p>\n<p>It was an out of this world experience. It was as if she had never stopped performing. She was better than ever (and she used to be the best). Thousands of Iranians were hypnotised by her everlasting charisma and powerful voice, which unbelievably, didn't go even slightly flat or sharp throughout the whole concert.</p>\n<p>It was a historic moment for all Iranians to see their beloved ‘pop star’ perform again for them. It was perfection.</p>\n<p>###3 Depeche Mode and Nitzer Ebb in Northern California_1990</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7464/28024647276_d660e9e671_b.jpg\" alt=\"n\"></p>\n<p>I had just turned 18 and moved to the United States from Germany. My favourite band, Depeche Mode, had just released one of the most amazing albums of all time, <em>Violator</em>, and they were about to perform in this huge land I had just moved to… Do I really need to write anything about an always-spectacular Depeche Mode concert? Well, guess what! I won’t.</p>\n<p>But where things got more interesting and exciting for me is when Nitzer Ebb (my electronic high school band used to cover their songs in Germany) opened for Depeche Mode in a huge American stadium (this was the 'cool, underground' band of my teenage years). The majority of the U.S crowd didn't know Nitzer Ebb. But I did, and I knew all their lyrics, and started to scream along 'Douglas McCarthy' like a proudly devoted fan. Their amazing basslines, and fascinating drum patterns were simply magical on that hot Californian Summer day...</p>\n<p>###4 Front 242 in San Francisco_1991</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7445/28058636025_c6dcf3a8e0_b.jpg\" alt=\"f\"></p>\n<p>One of my main teenage influences in electronic music was Front 242, especially between 1982 and 1991. Their Tyranny tour (1991) was a sort of grand finale for me, celebrating their decade long pioneering electronic music and thrilling performances.</p>\n<p>I was slowly transitioning to techno, which at that time was all about sound experimentation and a different form of body and mind stimulation.\nI danced and po-goed one last time to their electrifying and provocative sounds. There was still a sense of positive and abstract danger present during their show. I think the beauty of their kind of ‘Hardcore’ was the fact that they were performing it with utmost control and elegance.</p>\n<p>###5 SET Festival in Tehran_2015</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7365/27956253842_6b8f3a483d_b.jpg\" alt=\"s\"></p>\n<p>SET is an Iranian, artist-run organisation with an annual festival and individual events throughout the year. The focus is experimental electronic music and visuals that deal with technology and art as well as the mediums themselves.</p>\n<p>It was spring of 2015, the first evening of our newborn all-DIY festival, and it would be my first opportunity to perform my work for an Iranian audience. In all honesty, I was ready for the worst outcome. There were definitely a few incidents in my twenty-year long career, where I’ve cleared rooms during European and American 'contemporary' art and music events!</p>\n<p>Now, was an Iranian audience with almost no background in experimental music going to leave during my performance as well? Were they going to start booing? Was I going to have random objects thrown at me? These were some of my thoughts before my performance.</p>\n<p>Contrary to my immature speculations, the audience’s reaction and reception was ethereal. I was deeply touched by people’s open-minded attitude and appreciation for experimental art. The positive energy during and after my performance was heavenly.</p>\n<p>This overall frame of mind carried on for the remaining audio/visual performances during the four days of the festival, which gave me a huge amount of spirit to continue my activities in my native home.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/271065270&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>This July saw the third edition of Terraforma Festival, the now annual weekend of electronic music taking place in the grounds of the beautiful Villa Arconati, just north of Milan. This venue played host to around twenty acts on two distinct stages over the weekend. Also hosted were a few hundred campers, and what felt like an equal share of attendees coming just for individual days. Low capacity, picturesque venues, clean design aesthetic, vast space and minimal security gave the festival a relaxed atmosphere that felt, for the most part, pleasingly detached from the sponsored sheen of many other festivals.</p>\n<p>Terraforma's ethos is unapologetically flamboyant. Their website reads like a pamphlet you might have collected from the Isle of White Festival in 1969:</p>\n<p><em>&quot;Terraforming is the theoretical process in which life on a planet becomes possible through the creation of an atmosphere. Terraforma is the manifest of our belief that new dimensions can now be terraformed. A three days festival where music is the catalyst: a timeless centre of gravity for energies, with a breaking point from which sounds and images create a sense of suspension capable of pointing us towards new perceptions.&quot;</em></p>\n<p>Nonetheless, it’s hard to fault the musical curation of the festival. Friday opened with Charlemagne Palestine hypnotically playing a grand piano in the middle of a meadow, as the sun set over the villa. This was followed by Rabih Beaini and Vincent Moon who beautifully executed an audiovisual journey through global religious and tribal practices as a meditation on the transcendental. The night peaked with a set from the ever formidable Helena Hauff, who opened with the rough electro she’s known for before quickly veering into pounding techno. The rest of the weekend saw live and DJ sets from the likes of Adrian Sherwood, Flanger, Biosphere and Lee Gamble.</p>\n<p>Particular highlights came from Mark Fell’s live show as Sensate Focus, as well as Beatrice Dillon, whose afternoon DJ set, despite the sound engineer’s dub siren, was one of the most fun and varied of the weekend. Healing Force Project provided an equally varied set but with drastically different content, spending the Saturday afternoon weaving through spiritual jazz, ambient and krautrock, before Dynamo Dreesen livened the place up with his own take on dub techno. The music at Terraforma was overall extremely well presented. As opposed to many festivals, set times were typically two hours, and there was almost only ever one act on at any given time. Moreover, some artists (Atom™, Francesco Cavaliere) were given two separate sets in order to showcase their diverse musical projects.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8877/27704169393_cc61525314_b.jpg\" alt=\"art\"></p>\n<p>Initially intrigued by the self-applied tagline of Terraforma as an “experimental and sustainable festival”, it certainly lives up to the former, but sadly the same can’t be said for sustainability. Some attempts had clearly been made; bins were segregated between paper, plastic, organic waste etc, water came from local supplies, and there’s an also an <a href=\"http://www.terraformafestival.com/#sustainability\">extensive gardening project</a> undertaken by the organisers. In spite of this, all drinks were served in disposable plastic cups, all campers were given a free towel branded by the sponsors, Carhartt, and at the end of the festival, “Jameson Survival Kits” were handed out, containing a range of mini Jameson goodies and a brown piece of paper, all packaged in a cardboard box. Thankfully this was about all we heard from the sponsors. The festival website specifies that this year the sustainability focus is on waste. Not only was this not achieved, but it seems strange to focus on one aspect of sustainability, and ignore the rest of the spectrum of what must be taken into account when trying to put on an event that could be described as sustainable.</p>\n<p>Their supposedly modern attitude towards sustainability is also somewhat at odds with the limited diversity of the line up. Women, people of colour and queer artists were noticeably lacking given the historical contributions of these communities to the field of experimental music. With only three women out of twenty acts, Terraforma could not maintain their status as a festival that comes across, online at least, as progressive and politically engaged. On that note, it’s worth mentioning that the festival not only lacked inclusivity but also accessibility. While the cost of entry to Terraforma is relatively affordable (weekend tickets range from 60-90€), the cost of food and drink once in the festival is prohibitively high.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7771/28241466091_19dd429351_b.jpg\" alt=\"art2\"></p>\n<p>The setting, design and music policy made Terraforma a pleasure to attend, and we left with that ever-exciting list of musicians to look up. It’s a shame then, that it misses the mark on some crucial principles. That said, we wouldn’t hesitate to go again and would certainly recommend it to anyone with an interest in experimental electronic music. Terraforma certainly feels like it has the potential to be politically radical if it’s a bit better thought out and its principles are properly enacted. Here’s hoping that next year we can have just as much fun, but sip an affordable drink out of a reusable cup and not be dancing to so many white men.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>I first came across the work of Emanuele Porcinai through Contort: the event series and label owned by Hayley and Samuel Kerridge. His 'Stainless' EP under his WSR moniker followed a lineage of electro-acoustic composition, while simultaneously absorbing these sounds into the realms of contemporary electronic experimentation. Recently, I was recommended a collaborative project of his with Illian Tapes producer Sciahri, entitled Unknot.</p>\n<p>Unknot have seen three releases since their debut in mid-2015. All have been self-released, striking an approach between the richly textured, acousmatic experiments of Porcinai, and Sciahri's dancefloor functional signature. The first release navigated through fractured glitch and pummeling warehouse 4/4 , while the second explored crumpled half-step grooves and stuttered post-dubstep textures. The latest, entitled simply 'Unknot03', covers a more subtle array of sample-based dance music. From the gentle euphoria of 'Strain' to the muted acid-techno of 'Corrosion', the release has a distinctly more 'high-definition' feel when compared to previous Unknot releases.</p>\n<p>With 'Unknot03' hitting stores in the past couple of months, Porcinai preparing for a WSR show at <a href=\"http://krake-festival.de/\">Krake Festival</a> and Sciahri citing new releases on the horizon, we decided to catch up with the pair to discuss the changing face of Unknot, solo pursuits and 'Aural Architecture'...</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/228345842&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Hi chaps, first off can you tell us how the two of you first met? You're both from Florence right?</strong></p>\n<p>Sciahri &amp; Emanuele: Hi, yes that’s correct, we are both from Florence. We went to the same high school and met through mutual friends, since we were both interested in electronic music and production. We both learnt how to make music during those years and used to exchange drafts and tracks, giving each other constant feedback, yet developing our own individual styles. Since then, our personal tastes and output have become increasingly divergent, but we have always played a very important role in each other’s musical growth.</p>\n<p><strong>The third of your Unknot series has recently been released. How did you start the project to begin with and why did you decide to self-release the material?</strong></p>\n<p>Sciahri &amp; Emanuele: Our project started about three years ago, when we suddenly realised that, even though we had known each other for many years, somehow we had never actually tried making music together. This was mostly due to the fact that we like different kinds of music and we’re interested in different things when it comes to writing.</p>\n<p>However, out of pure curiosity, we sat together in front of Sciahri’s setup and tried a few things out, just to see what would happen. These first experiments sounded like something completely new to us: they felt distant from our individual output, yet we could still relate to them. We loved how they felt alien and personal at the same time. Working with the same setup and workflow, we eventually managed to put a lot of finished material together. We noticed that all of it had a very distinctive sound and character. In the end we decided to put out a series of records.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8575/28330471646_87e2a0bcc5_b.jpg\" alt=\"uk\"></p>\n<p><strong>How do you think the collaboration is changing over time? From my perspective the sound seems to take a less rugged/gritty approach on this latest EP.</strong></p>\n<p>Emanuele: It keeps on changing indeed, as it tends to be the convergence between our individual outputs. Now, as opposed to three years ago, it’s perhaps becoming a bit more minimal. This is probably due to the fact that, at the moment, I’ve started doing things with very few elements and very little production; focusing instead on the performing/improvising part of the writing process. Sciahri is also getting more into exploring dense textures.</p>\n<p>We’ve never wanted to force our production in any particular direction, but rather let it evolve freely. Our workflow consists in jamming with only one piece of equipment and then taking layers and elements from this one recording; trying to organise it in a way that makes sense. We think that sticking with this method means the final pieces have a strong relationship with each other. We are interested in exploring and experimenting with all genres or non-genres. Since we don’t really have any control over each other’s taste, we don’t know what the result is going to be, and this can be quite exciting.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/201947841&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>What were your early experiences of dance/electronic music like growing up in Italy? Schiari you are based in Florence I believe; have you been to any of the Disco_nnect events there? I hear they put on some really interesting performances…</strong></p>\n<p>Sciahri &amp; Emanuele: In our teenage years, we witnessed some of the first wave of minimal techno (the good stuff, like the early Minus records), which somehow managed to reach a couple of clubs in Florence. Apart from this and some other rare exceptions, not much else has been happening in that city, bearing the burden of centuries of historical and artistic heritage and thus a sort of 'golden cage' with plenty of barriers and limitations when it comes to bringing new ideas and setting up events. Neither of us has ever been that much of a raver either, however, sometimes we would migrate to neighbouring cities, like Bologna, where things were a bit more exciting.</p>\n<p>Sciahri: As far as Disco_nnect is concerned, I know that they've organised a few events featuring very good artists. One of their residents is Herva: a very good friend of mine as well as a great musician whom I really respect. Apart from this, I don’t have much to say to be honest, I don’t really feel part of what happens in this city music-wise.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8869/28330809626_c0f5290f27_b.jpg\" alt=\"s\"></p>\n<p><em>Sciahri DJing at TAG Club, Venezia.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a bit about each of your solo work? Schiari, how did you first get involved with Dario and Marco of Illian Tape?</strong></p>\n<p>Sciahri: The first EP I did on Ilian Tape was the beginning of it all. Those old tracks definitely have some sort of 'classical' techno elements, which I was trying to bring in a personal context. The EP on Opal Tapes is more recent and I think with that material, I decided to get those recognisable techno elements out of me, since 95% of the elements originated from analog synthesisers. My latest track, released on Mord Records, is also characterised by this approach, perhaps to an even greater extent, as it was picked from a collection of tracks produced with a modular set-up that I recently put together. I am interested in experimenting within techno frameworks, but only with my own, personally-crafted ingredients.</p>\n<p>The story behind the Ilian Tape release itself is actually quite short: I sent them an email with some music more or less a year before the first release, and about a month later Dario got back to me saying that he wanted to hear more, so we started working from then.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/240647058&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Emanuele, I was a big fan of your Contort EP. The sounds for that were sourced between Florence/Manchester and featured live instrumentation. Were these recordings created specifically for the release or just material you ended up sampling? Do you plan to work with the same musicians (Thomas Griffiths, Niccolò Noli) on future releases?</strong></p>\n<p>Emanuele: Thanks! The release was actually compiled last year by Sam Kerridge, picked from material that I had been putting together in the previous two years, a lot of which is still unreleased. I tend to work at different stages: I am almost never the kind of producer who sits down at the table with a computer and starts writing. I need to have different stimuli and often to get my hands on physical objects to get inspired, so sometimes I have some kind of instrumental sessions with other instrumental musicians, where I bring ideas that are only drafted or partially finished. These then take a more defined shape when I put them together with electronics.</p>\n<p>Tom Griffiths was one of my university classmates while I was studying sound in Manchester, he is a brilliant double-bass and cello player and he is the first person I worked with since I started to get interested in using strings. Niccolò is an old friend of mine from Florence who wrote and played the bass parts for 'Inner Oceans' from that EP. What I love about him is that he always has a lot of cool ideas but, since he isn’t a professional bass player, he doesn’t really know what’s technically 'right' and 'wrong'. He is an extremely inspiring musician to work with and we focus a lot on mistakes and on how to preserve the ones that make things exciting. It’s hard to say what’s going to end up on future releases, but I actually started to build some string instruments to perform with and play my own strings parts. These are now very minimal and a bit more focused on the textural potential of strings rather than the melodic one.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8621/28330813246_a87002d3fe_b.jpg\" alt=\"aw\"></p>\n<p><em>WSR alongside Koenraad Ecker, Atonal 2015.</em></p>\n<p><strong>You graduated from Manchester School of Sound Recording a year or two ago as well. Can you tell us a bit more about your experiments with what is termed 'Aural Architecture' in the 'Stainless' press release?</strong></p>\n<p>With great pleasure. 'Aural Architecture' is a kind of fancy definition to describe the auditive feature of architectural spaces, the way buildings reverberate and sound. The people who defined this term (Barry Blesser and Linda-Ruth Salter) wrote a lot of interesting stuff about this topic. I started to get interested in this kind of thing while studying Acoustics at university, particularly in how the physics behind the phenomenon of reverberation works; the way it can be affected by humans and vice versa, especially when musical events occur.</p>\n<p>I started to become, and still am, obsessed with the concept of writing and recording music within a space, rather than just recording instruments from very close and then taking them in this abstract non-place, which is so often the case nowadays. While still at university, I started to do stuff like using the entire top floor and toilets of the school as a reverb chamber to process sounds. I also did something similar in a few industrial spaces around Manchester, which I was able to access to do research for my dissertation project (which was also to do with aural architecture). Some of the material for the Contort EP took shape there.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/226422410&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Are you still based in Manchester? How have you felt about the political confusion we have seen in the UK recently?</strong></p>\n<p>I have actually been living in Berlin for the past year and haven’t been to Manchester for a while, so I could only witness it all from a distance and through the personal experiences of friends who live there. What happened is very unsettling and it definitely feels like going backward. As far as I’m concerned, I lived and studied in the UK for four years, and as a EU student, I was able to access domestic fees (about a third of the international fee) and to take out a student loan to pay my university fee. I consider myself lucky as I’m not sure whether this will still be possible for people like me who want to do a similar thing in the future.</p>\n<p>However, I think and hope that, in the long run, things will somehow work. In fact, regardless of the vast regressive and self-destructive moves politics has recently made - which don’t really look like originating from a clear and concrete plan of what to do with the future - there are still a lot of people whose work and life relies on EU-regulated infrastructures, and I don’t believe they will let it all collapse so easily.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/252027722&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Finally what's next for yourselves? Can we expect an album length release from Unknot at any point in the future?</strong></p>\n<p>Sciahri: For what concerns future projects, I have an important EP to be released in the next months...</p>\n<p>Emanuele: I’m working on a new solo record, but I can’t say much at the moment. Regarding an Unknot album release, it would be pretty difficult to realise at the moment - mainly because we live in different countries and we manage to meet only occasionally - but it’s definitely something that we have in mind and would like to try out at some point.</p>\n<p><em>'Unknot03' is available <a href=\"https://boomkat.com/products/unknot03\">now</a>.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/231483737&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Anne Lepère, a Brussels-based artist, explores the relationships between various strains of sound design in her work: field recordings, radio drama, and experimental music. Following her time as a co-student at l’IHECS (apply communication degree), Lepère continued to explore the relationship between melody, the voice and the body: in a range of different workshops and residencies. This includes building microphones, &quot;playing sounds of daily life&quot;, choreographic programs, and breathing practices...  Since then, she has taken part in a wide scope of other sound-related projects, including co-creating Karaonomatopiek, which was performed in 2015 at the Cinéma Galeries in Brussels and Centre Pompidou in Paris with the Revue Papier Machine. She is also increasingly working collaboratively with the Collectif Moniek — a Radio Cabaret project — and with dancers &amp; choreographers with Fondation Royaumont.</p>\n<p>We caught up with Lepère to chat about her time on Hailuoto. Using poetic language, Lepère recalls communal life during the residency: “Ten strangers, ten people listening carefully to each other but without any effort, creating a smooth atmosphere where everybody is moving softly. Usually it takes time to be able to act out your own rhythm within a group without leaving your path… here it seems so easy. Ten guys are exploring this astonishing place… a space on the island where you can also hear yourself belonging to a space. Bringing you to the awareness of a resonant inside. Like a skin between voices and world.”</p>\n<p>Lepère describes encountering what she identifies as a “mise en abyme process” on the island. The term mise en abyme refers to when an image reproduces a replica of itself into infinity, like the reflection when two mirrors are placed facing each other. It’s also used to describe artistic techniques like a having film-within-a-film, or a dream-within-a-dream. Lepère recalls how the residency—a social microcosm-within-a-microcosm—allowed the international artists to use their collaboration to explore broader issues: “At first you’re arriving on an island, you hear stories of this Hailuoto community. What is happening here is like a micro-life… What position for the strangers, the children, the elderly in this community? How to react to drama? How to move in this space… an island with a very defined territory?”</p>\n<p>Overall, the residency sounds like it was a pretty utopian experience. The artists turned the house they were staying in into an instrument, banging on the walls and floors to “play” the architecture itself, giving a new meaning to the term ‘house music.’ The score for their improvisational piece ‘Field Techno’ specifies that you should gather in a forest with ‘multiple analogue, digital, portable noisemaking objects’ in order to ‘listen to the environment, incorporate the non-human’, which sounds like a recipe for a great afternoon. “Fascinated by one sound, focusing on it, you may forget the ensemble,” Lepère comments about the delicate balance required for collaborations such as these. “It can be a fragile composition: outside feeding the inside... inside feeding the outside.”</p>\n<p>Lepère’s mix is titled ‘Hailuoto Blue’, and gives us a sonic snapshot of her thought-provoking explorations of the unique sounds of the island. The hour-long curation of the results of the residency’s practical research features tracks produced by other artists who took part, as well as referencing some of their influences. Human and electronic voices reflect and refract the natural music of the environment within which they were recorded, creating the musical equivalent of wondering through an unknown landscape, searching for wildlife.</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist:</strong></p>\n<p>Our Field - Sound Map Hailuoto // Hai Art &amp; Various [unreleased]\t\t\nCellar Song for Five Computer Voices // Maciej Ratajski (Grupa ETC) after Emmett Williams [unknown]\t\t\nThe Unavailable Memory Of // John Cage [Mode]\t\t\nThe Song of Aurora // Anne Lepère [unreleased]\t\nNorthern Island // Kritzkom [unreleased]\t\t\t\nHaiku out of Cage // John Cage (edit.

    "content": "<p><em>Photos by Curt Lundberg.</em></p>\n<p>Until 1999, Norberg was probably best known for its history mining and refining iron ore. Amongst enthusiasts, it is also home to the Engelsberg-Norbergs Järnväg railway, which is now protected as a heritage site. Located a couple of hours outside of Stockholm, these days Norberg has a new attraction.</p>\n<p>Despite running since the close of the '90s, 'Norbergfestival', has seen numerous incarnations. First founded by Michael Østerz Christiansen and Dag Celsing, these days Norbergfestival is run by 'Anrikningsverket', a non-profit organisation which holds responsibility for numerous other events in Southern Sweden.</p>\n<p>The fact it is volunteer-led is a large part of the festival's success. Attendees are invited to exchange their time and labour for free attendance, basic sleeping provisions, food and generally, a really great time. It's my guess Scandinavia's unparalleled social and welfare care is something to do with the fact people are so willing to donate their labour for free, although visitors come from all over the world.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest attractions of Norberg for me was the opportunity to immerse myself in a mix of unfamiliar sounds. As the year starts wearing on, with more and more weekend events announced, I can't help but notice the same names cropping up again and again on different bills. Norberg felt different. There were a number of expected big-hitters such as Peder Mannefelt, Aisha Devï and Amnesia Scanner, but the festival also takes an active role in promoting lesser known, local talents. Stockholm based Sissel Wincent makes a good example, delivering a set of booming live renditions of her recent 'Illusion of Randomness' EP. So do acts like Staycore, Copenhagen based Apeiron Crew and the 'Stockholm Drone Society' with whom Maria Horn and Posh Isolation producer Mats Erlandsson count their names.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8692/28800714275_9f9f021645_b.jpg\" alt=\"a\"></p>\n<p><em>Apeiron Crew at the 303 Stage.</em></p>\n<p>It is worth noting that Norbergfestival is also completely gender balanced. This is a fact scarcely mentioned, which is a shame as most competing festivals struggle to book even a handful female artists. Bloc is a good example - after coming under fire last year they vowed to rectify the situation in 2016, yet I believe the number of female acts still amounted to less than 20% of the demographic. Norberg's approach to artist curation is also reflected in the attendees - roughly equal numbers of men and women coming to enjoy the experience, with the kind of friendly, respectful atmosphere you'd expect to accompany that.</p>\n<p>Much like Berlin Atonal, the venue forms a large part of the attraction at Norberg. Mimer, the actual mining facility ran from 1960 to 1980, at which point (like many parallels in the UK), the industry was capitulated and the operation abandoned. Being a site of historical interest the building was gutted but survived demolition,  in part due to its revival as a venue for musical happenings (the original founders of the festival collaborated with local councils to run the first event in 1999 and local authorities have heavy involvement to this day). In my opinion, the parallels with Berlin Atonal stop there however. Norberg felt more rounded, more inclusive and above all, significantly more fun.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7704/28723584031_2facb3b083_b.jpg\" alt=\"o\"></p>\n<p><em>Saturday's 'Acidruset'.</em></p>\n<p>As well as the performances for example, we were treated to morning yoga in a local park, soundtracked by the mechanical dub-techno and languid acid of Kliin and Curt Lundberg. We were also invited to 'Acidruset', a race round a nearby field track complete with squelching acid soundtrack (rather than the substance, which I was told a bemused local reporter in attendance had inquired about).</p>\n<p>Musically, the festival also seeks to entertain rather than intimidate. It has had a long history with breakcore and jungle acts, and this year Sully and DJRum represented the higher tempos. Both were unexpected standouts for me, filling the festival's 'Kraftwerk' building with clamorous, pore clogging footwork and knockout jungle. The venue's sound system provided some of the most visceral experiences I think I've ever had, the low end penetrating my body so thoroughly I could feel my windpipe rattling. Looking up through the projector beams it was sometimes possible to see gentle trickles of dust from the ceiling.</p>\n<p>Maria W Horn's 'TMRW' project also put the space to exceptional use, taut 8-bit vocal manipulations, slamming skin drum rhythms and submerged glitch having hypnotic effect. Amongst the audience stood an estate car ensconcing red light from its interior, heightening the performances sci-fi like draw.</p>\n<p>There were other slightly theatrical elements turning heads throughout the weekend, for example DJ Mayhem marching to the 303 stage clad in black ski masks wielding banners and flares, or Gabor Lazàr's onslaught of metallic modulations through a layer of blue light and smoke so thick you could barely see your hand in front of your face.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8617/28185728223_cfdc909583_b.jpg\" alt=\"p\"></p>\n<p><em>Peder Mannerfelt at Kraftwerk.</em></p>\n<p>Peder Mannerfelt took the performance aspect into the surreal, donning the stage with his signature straw covered mask, expelling wild resonances and mounting sawtooth assaults in front of psychedelic projections. These saw a shirtless Mannerfelt floating through a kaleidoscope of colours that'd put Acid Mother's Temple to shame, while the man himself jerked to and fro in front. His set culminated in mangled acid and breakbeat, indiscernible granular vocals bending minds even further.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the ultimate theatricality was the Mimer stage itself. Reserved largely for the festival's beatless excursions, hauling yourself up sheer metal staircases onto the brutalist concrete viewing points felt nothing short of placing yourself in Andrey Tarkovsky's Stalker. Ewa Justka was one of my favourite acts to perform in Mimer, creating a groaning digital thunderstorm reminiscent of Puce Mary. Sorrowing Christ's Sunn O))) style drone was equally at home in Mimer, shoegaze guitar and abstracted vocals creating an effect like The Wall era Pink Floyd stretched to 800% speed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8715/28800714405_694e6d268e_b.jpg\" alt=\"a\"></p>\n<p><em>Mimer Stage.</em></p>\n<p>Focusing exclusively on the more conceptual performances would be wrong however, as the festival also showcased plenty of no frills dancefloor fun of all shapes and sizes. DJ Stingray 313 was another unexpected standout for me, delivering a flawless two hour set of pummelling electro. Razor sharp basslines and murderously precise drumwork had the whole of Kraftwerk locked in rhythmic sway.</p>\n<p>Nidia Minaj brought a similarly effective set of dancefloor jams of a different nature. Stuttered percussive cuts, jacked up Kuduro and lock jam rhythms set the room in motion, but it's the clattering, bassed up rendition of Rihanna's 'Bitch Better Have My Money' which sticks in my mind the most.</p>\n<p>Speaking of memorable performances, I'd wager most people's take-home stories included at least a few words on Amnesia Scanner. Standing at their control stations in pitch black aside from two roaming technicolor searchlights, the duo cast an Autechre-like stage presence. The parallels with Warp's best export don't end there however - an hour of computerised paranoia, modular abstractions and bit-fucked grime reductions built to a rapture like climax, before the crowd was blasted with cold air and a sudden cut to silence.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8869/28800713855_e788763c5f_b.jpg\" alt=\"r\"></p>\n<p>Norbergfestival has been running for 17 years now. From relatively small scale beginnings as something which sounds to me more like an extended free party, the festival has mutated through different genres and stylistic outputs, growing to the diverse, inclusive and well-rounded experience it is today. Despite the progression however, Norbergfestival has remained small. Around 600 tickets are sold on average, and to my mind it's small scale nature is one of the things that makes it so memorable. It's impossible to believe this has been achieved without a great deal of love, sweat and hard work. Amazingly, these efforts are given freely without the need for large investments, and while I'd normally be opposed to such wide-scale unpaid labour, I found it impossible to find a member of the volunteer crew with a bad word to say about Norbergfestival.</p>\n<p>Whilst I can't claim a share of the pride this team that have made it all possible are rightly entitled to, I'm honoured to be able to say I've attended something which I believe is very special, and should be cherished for as long as it's able to exist. If you get a chance to go, I thoroughly recommend it.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div><p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BIpdwraAkBr/\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;\" target=\"_blank\">A video posted by Stray Landings (@straylandingsrecordings)</a> on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2016-08-03T13:16:19+00:00\">Aug 3, 2016 at 6:16am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote>\n<script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script>\n",

    "content": "<p>Minimal: for the most part, it's not a genre that excites me too much. An endless wave of barely distinguishable M_nus releases with unfathomably high Discogs values certainly hasn't helped, either. When it's right however it can be really right, as output from labels like ~scape, or Jan Jelinek's back-catalogue will attest. Berlin's Margaret Dygas is another such artist who rarely gets it wrong. Her last release, the head-spinning 'Even 11', is no different, showcasing her freeform approach to the genre with as much ingenuity as ever.</p>\n<p>Dygas' work has always had a hazy, dream-like quality to it. An endless whirlpool of sampled drums and soulful abstractions come together to form percussive romps which put you in a state of hypnosis. 'Even 11' is a slinking, cautious half-stepper, following this heritage as strongly as ever. The track maintains an unrelenting sub-pressure across its ten minute duration, heavily restrained, yet oddly psychedelic at the same time.</p>\n<p>&quot;How can she lose... what a winning hand&quot; sputters out at awkward intervals. Dygas' use of The Commodores 'Brick House' here is typical of her penchant for re-contextualising sound. This, along with her knack for programming rhythms, brings the early percussive excursions of Hessle Audio's Joe to mind - taut motorik drums and oddball, groove-rider basslines working into a dizzying climax.</p>\n<p>In many ways, 'Wishing Well' follows a similar trajectory. Swirling vocal loops, enchanting drum-play and off-kilter cymbal flourishes work to mesmeric effect. A reductionist sub chugs underneath, which in another context could easily find itself sitting on a Sähkö Records 12&quot;.</p>\n<p>Perlon have played host to some of Dygas' best work, notably her classic 2009 'Invisible Circles' EP. 'Even 11' maintains her reputation as one of the most inventive dancefloor practitioner's out there, crafting a release which stitches a web of unlikely samples into something truly magical.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wT6oiPyr_3E\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p>Simon Pomery aka Blood Music's live shows are a visceral experience to say the least. Twisted electronics and contact mic abstractions crumple beneath Pomery's crushing rhythms, in an onslaught which leaves your bones rattling.  Where bands setups tend to push drummers to the back, in response to an &quot;unspoken and repressive hierarchy&quot; as he put to us during an interview last year, Blood Music shows put them back in focus.</p>\n<p>This is due to the fact his style if drumming is far from ordinary. Rather than sitting behind a kit, Pomery stands - wielding something between orchestral mallets and traditional sticks. His approach to drumming takes influence from everything from Japanese Taiko drumming to Singaporean martial arts. His recorded works capture this energy perfectly - his 'Chicks' 12&quot; for Diagonal last year alternating between chugging motorik abstractions and pensive droning interludes.</p>\n<p>With a show at Cafe Oto this evening alongside Peder Mannerfelt and rkss, as well as a debut LP in progress, we decided to invite Pomery to discuss five of his most memorable gigging experiences. As ever from those from the Diagonal camp, his contributions are as lively and engaging as they are unexpected.</p>\n<p>###1 Borbetomagus at Tusk_2014</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8444/28411930534_39e916929d_b.jpg\" alt=\"bm\"></p>\n<p>The only acts on the bill familiar to me were Hijokaidan and Hatsune Kaidan, who I saw at Multiple Tap, Oto. Hatsune were so much better at Oto, with a different ‘singer’ interpreting their digital woman creation. But the curation of this festival was killer. In amongst all this noise there was Asiq Nargile, an asiq bard from Georgia.</p>\n<p>I listen to so much music all the time. Each day I want to hear something I know nothing about. Tusk presented many discoveries for me. So, I was trying to buy something from the record stall but this big hairy yank was in my way, which was actually Jim Sauer. When Borbetomagus came on, Don Dietrich, whose skin was the complexion of the inside of a teapot, kept asking for his monitor to be louder. You couldn’t tell what sound was coming from where. They ripped the whole place apart from the word go. It was horrible. Donald Miller was reclining in the middle, playing his guitar as if on a beanbag. In terms of locating the sound, there seemed to be some sort of lag - a delay in everything, but the actual sounds seemed to be at 300 bpm. The sense of real and imaginary time being altered in front of you was made worse by the documentary footage of them being screened behind, covering 40 years of gigs: they had cheated time, they hadn’t aged. Like Incapacitants, they hadn’t changed their sonic method: their art is true and beautiful. These three horrors were so locked into each other that they were orchestrating the whole thing.</p>\n<p>As Donald said at the Q&amp;A, “we’re fucking musicians, okay? Fuck you”. Inside the feedback of two bells and one guitar, there are multiplicities of melody in the frequencies. The roar pummels and engulfs you. There is no escape. You are as locked into the cacophony as their saxophones are when the two men standing do their famous 'bells together', locking swords. It’s so homoerotic.</p>\n<p>In those 45 magic minutes, Borbetomagus was the ONLY time I have ever in my life (and I like to think I can take some extreme musical experiences) that I have literally, physically been knocked over by a performance. On my iPhone recording of this experience, you can hear my girlfriend saying “do you want to sit down?” I was wobbly and hadn’t noticed. Maybe it was the varieties of Newcastle brown ales I was drinking. But really, it was the sound of Borbetomagus. My phone recording captures something of the experience. I can hear myself breathing weirdly.</p>\n<p>###2 Russell Haswell at Del La War Pavilion_2013</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8243/28414948853_65a8afac89_b.jpg\" alt=\"q\"></p>\n<p>Fennesz badly needed a haircut. Kevin Drumm was good. Russell stole the show. This is ever more amusing when considering what a mess his set was when he played with Blood Music the night before, at the first Diagonal Showcase. In the Waiting Room, it was a more broken, faulty version of what would become a 37 minute workout. For Mego, Russ put his pothole light on his head, the strobes were out, so was the white noise. Brucey played in his shed. I was wandering around with Oscar [Powell]. We imbibed quite early that day, which meant I couldn’t take anything seriously.</p>\n<p>###3 Blood Music at Soup - Tokyo_2016</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8824/28414949573_db5a098ded_b.jpg\" alt=\"p\"></p>\n<p>My shoulders were sore because the day before I had trained Taiko drumming with the Ondekoza. I left the club after soundcheck to wander around the neighbourhood. On my return, there was some resistance on the door. I couldn’t open it at first, but when I did there was a small long-haired bearded man on the other side. &quot;SSSSIIIIIMMMMOOONNNN!&quot; Pain Jerk and I embraced for what seemed like 15 seconds of love. On the live recording you can hear him shouting “ENCORE” at me. It was a room of 50 people sweating, losing their shit, and shouting at me. It was pure joy.</p>\n<p>When I left the bar and said &quot;bye&quot; everyone in the venue turned and just screamed with joy. This was beyond language. In my vocal work that night I said stuff about what it is to be or think 'beyond language'. Miclodiet calls his night 'Wasted' so I made a track especially for him: my rework of a favourite, &quot;All My Friends&quot; by Snakehips featuring Tinashe. One day, I would like to work with Tinashe. I love her voice and her work. It was the best drum sound I have ever had live: that sound man is a beast and makes everyone else who has mic-D my drums seem weak. He totally got what I was trying to do and did a perfect mix of electronics and acoustic drums and voice. Soup is such a special venue.</p>\n<p>###4 Yousuke Yukimatsu at Club Stomp - Osaka_2016</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8409/28412040594_2d44d1ddf7_b.jpg\" alt=\"y\"></p>\n<p>There is no DJ like him. His style is 100% his own, crafted over years of breaking filters and mixers and making unexpectedly perfect mixes. He usually takes his shirt off. This set ended with him playing Arthur Russell and me finding the same pitch with a contact mic on my drum, in a perfect symbiosis of accident and design. He said later “so we had a session”. He would be one of my top five DJs.</p>\n<p>###5 Fushitsusha - Tokyo_2016</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8178/28999339066_6d3fc60d96_b.jpg\" alt=\"a\"></p>\n<p>I had spent the night in a karaoke bar and found out the morning after that Haino was in town. My set included Iggy Pop, Bowie, and several tracks by Steely Dan. There was some sort of glitch which meant every Steely Dan track came on twice. I didn’t complain. Sometimes it’s better to go for the fun option.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/210731802&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Although I might not have clocked the name until years later, my first exposure to Peder Mannerfelt would have been six or seven years ago, listening to the glacial electro-pop of fellow Swede, Fever Ray. As well as helping produce some of her most notable tracks, Mannerfelt has also worked with artists like Glasser, and even swung a credit on Britney Spears' 'Toxic' while working as a runner for producers Bloodshy &amp; Avant.</p>\n<p>These days however, the Stockholm based artist is well-established in his own right. His raw, psychedelia-laced take on electronic music has seen him release everywhere from Avian to London-run We Can Elude Control. Last year Mannerfelt released <em>The Swedish Congo Record</em> ‎through Yves De Mey and Peter Van Hoesen's Archives Intérieures, recreating tracks from the Armand Denis recorded  <em>The Belgian Congo Records</em> using only synthesisers. For his latest project, Mannerfelt sought to do the exact opposite. <em>Controlling Body</em>, produced alongside New York residing Glasser is constructed almost entirely from samples, moving into notably more pop-friendly territory.</p>\n<p>He has also put significant effort into the running of his own label, Peder Mannerfelt Produktion, with help from long-standing friend Pär Grindvik. The label has championed catching artists at their breakthrough, releasing early work from the likes of Klara Lewis and Machine Woman, most recently being responsible for the debut offering from Drömfakulteten member Sissel Wincent.</p>\n<p>With an upcoming record on Will Bankhead and Joy O's Hinge Finger, I sat down with Mannerfelt ahead of a packed set at Cafe OTO to discuss masks, cultural appropriation and Swedish fashion trends.</p>\n<p><strong>I enjoyed your set at Norbergfestival the other week. How was it playing with that insane bass system? I could see dust trickling down from the roof. Did you enjoy the rest of the festival?</strong></p>\n<p>Nice! That's how I like it. It's quite punishing from what I remember. I actually played a festival in Moscow last summer which was like the Russian equivalent of that. 10,000 people in an old factory site that's about to be torn down, it was crazy. I played in a similar room in a disused factory. The bass in there was the same but even more! When I was playing everything was jumping, actually my laptop crapped out for the first time ever. The USB ports went down because there was so much bass. Afterwards everything was covered in black soot. It was quite amazing.</p>\n<p>I think Norberg looks bigger from the outside if you see what I mean, but they have a nice thing going there. I played there with Roll The Dice as well, I've been a couple of times.</p>\n<p><strong>It reminded me of the Berlin Atonal setting but way more stripped back. Speaking of Atonal I wanted to ask you about your visual show, I remember seeing it for the first time there last year. Who does the visuals?</strong></p>\n<p>I made the show for that Atonal performance. I did it with a guy called Miguel Angel Regalado who lives in Stockholm. He goes under the name VJ Gauchito.  I had played in the small room at Atonal the year previous so I'd seen the template visuals going around - black and white imagery with crows flying by... I wanted it to be totally different. It was kind of taking the piss a bit but it turned out amazing.</p>\n<p><strong>I didn't want to say that so I'm glad you did! I saw lots of bemused faces at Atonal. It's like you on a really intense acid trip floating through technicolour space...</strong></p>\n<p>(Laughs) Yeah but it is! We were just messing around filming with a green screen. Still, it serves its purpose of being totally maxed out. I know it turned a lot of heads at Atonal, exactly how I wanted it to: me on a big screen dancing about and not being too serious.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8035/29082337411_ac18b6323b_b.jpg\" alt=\"q\"></p>\n<p><strong>My problem with Atonal that year was there were too many people doing the same thing. That was the nice thing about the sets from yourself and Blood Music.</strong></p>\n<p>Especially in that main hall, everyone is so used to chucking loads of reverb on everything. When they do that everything starts to sound the same and everything looks the same; everyone in the audience is wearing black... That's kind of cool in a way, it's like a uniform. But when you turn on the colours, - I knew it was going to look striking especially on that massive screen.</p>\n<p><strong>Let's talk about your mask. Is it ever a struggle to play with? Does it stop you seeing what you're doing? It made me think about Fever Ray and The Knife: it has that slightly theatrical element to it obviously.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah that's where I learnt that actually. With quite small means you can get a big impact. The mask fits easily into a small ball in my backpack but it's something! It's not just a bloke with a laptop and synth. I can have fun with it and it's theatrical as you say. I like stepping into a different roll on stage: I totally got that from Fever Ray. Once we were in those costumes we were on a different level. I can hang out in the park with my kids, then I can come here and be a bit stupid and play some bleeps and stuff. It helps me with getting into the sound.</p>\n<p><strong>Going back to Norberg I wanted to ask if you caught Sissel Wincent's set? You met through Anna Vtorova [Machine Woman] right?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah I saw a little bit. It was really really good! It was almost better than I'd expected in a way. And yes we met through Anna. She sent Sissel's music my way and it happened she lived in Stockholm as well. We actually met when Anna played in Stockholm, they'd found each other online before I think. I saw Sissel play in Drömfakulteten. That was one of the best things I've seen in a long time, the energy there was amazing...</p>\n<p>Drömfakulteten is really good. It's totally disjointed, just a bunch of people chucking their gear on the table and playing back to back. There was so much energy when they played which is really cool and had a kind of different approach in the scene.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/264563155&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I was reading your RA interview earlier and picked up on what you said about Paul Purgas encouraging you to release things which were at the time half-finished in your eyes. It struck me Sissel's release has the same kind of raw, not too polished feel to it as well.</strong></p>\n<p>Still we worked on it for quite some time. We had a really good back and forth exchange with some constructive criticism going on. I really enjoy that myself, when someone steps in and says 'ok make this bit shorter and this is the good bit'. You don't need too much, two words can open something up in a different way. Paul helped me in the beginning and I have a similar thing with Pär Grindvik. We have daily discussions about everything; being brutally honest with each other. It's kind of like having someone next to you telling you whether something is good or not. I find that it helps if you're open to constructive criticism and Sissel was <em>really</em> open to it. She developed so much in those months we were working on the record.</p>\n<p>I'm a strong believer that anything can be pushed a bit more, even if you want to keep it really raw. That's what I really liked about her music and Anna's - it's really raw and off the cuff, but it's still really relevant. There's so much music that when I hear it, it just doesn't strike me, but when you hear something that's good it really marks a spot.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8107/29161162015_8b3441c57a_b.jpg\" alt=\"q\"></p>\n<p><strong>You mentioned Pär Grindvik, how did you first meet?</strong></p>\n<p>He used to work in a record store in Stockholm, that where we met. I was working and DJing with another guy called Henrik von Sivers and we were really young and hungry. We were coming from more of a band/indie world and wanted to get into techno. Pär had been into techno for a really long time and had owned a store and stuff... I think he could see our energy and wanted to move a bit more in our direction. He was just in the process of moving to Berlin then, so we started working together: me, Henrik and him. That was one constellation in a way. The way Henrik and I worked kind of faded out in the end. Me and Pär didn't talk for a year or so, then slowly came back together and started talking. When I started this project under my own name up he saw where it came from and helped me. I was out in the wilderness for a little while and didn't know what I was doing. He helped me set up everything with my label, he's doing the label management for me.  He's also part of the booking agency I'm on.</p>\n<p>It's a really tight circle which is great because we can get stuff done fast. I enjoy bringing new artists into that circle because I feel like Stockholm is a really excluding place. People keep to their own in every kind of way (age wise, immigrants and Swedes) it's really hard to get into groups. Everyone's really nice and polite and open, but to get into a scene is quite difficult. That's one of the biggest differences to here I would say. In London, if you go to a pub you see people of different ages and from different backgrounds, but if you go to a bar in Stockholm you'll just have one specific group of people. If someone from another group walks in, it's not going to cause tension but you're not going to mix. It's something I see as a huge problem in Sweden. Especially as we've had so many immigrants in Sweden over the last couple of years.</p>\n<p><strong>Interesting in the context of Norberg which has taken a large number of Syrian refugees...</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah exactly. Especially in Norberg. I think the problem in Sweden is letting people into our circles.</p>\n<p><strong>I had a discussion with a Danish friend about a record store in Copenhagen I really like, and he said they were really rude to him when he'd been in. He said there's a saying there that goes something like 'tourists: don't leave us alone with the locals' - I was wondering if it's the same kind of thing in Sweden...</strong></p>\n<p>Stockholm is really cool but everyone is so sensitive and doesn't want to do the wrong thing. It's crazy. Because it's so small it always has to be only one thing going at a given time. There can never be two things. Like last year Acne started doing these leather biker jackets. That filtered down so far that now everyone has a leather biker jacket. From upmarket posh people to cool hipsters, everyone has it.</p>\n<p>You see it everywhere when you pick up on this idea. Suddenly everything changes and people move to a new thing, but it's only ever one thing: in food, in fashion, in music. Here different stuff can work at the same time. I think that has to do with Stockholm being really excluding in a way.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8664/29126822736_6cf76cd3e7_b.jpg\" alt=\"a\"></p>\n<p><strong>Maybe the fact it can be so excluding generally means the people that are willing to experiment with new things go to an extra level in a way. Maybe that would explain why projects like Norberg and Drömfakulteten seem so inclusive to me.</strong></p>\n<p>What I really love about Drömfakulteten is that they're claiming their own space. Normally everyone has to wait in line for their turn but they're just bypassing that. It's like punk you know? Walking up and claiming your space. I really like the fact they're doing it.</p>\n<p><strong>I wanted to ask you about <em>The Swedish Congo Record</em> too. How did you come across the original album and what prompted you to start working with it?</strong></p>\n<p>I was buying loads of those kind of records ten years ago or so, mainly with the idea of sampling them. I think I found that record in New York. What I realised with a lot of these records from West Africa was that it was so easy to sample a loop and add a kick drum and you'd have a banger... It felt like cheating! I didn't want to do it that way.</p>\n<p>To give you the long story I found the score for this Steve Reich piece called <em>Music for Pieces of Wood</em>. Just as a stupid thing I played that on my 909 so it became <em>Music for Pieces of 909</em>. The idea was doing the same with the Congo record. Taking something and instead of sampling it, put my own sounds on it. It's the opposite of sampling. I see it as doing a cover version. It's not exactly like the originals.</p>\n<p>It was actually a discussion I had with Paul Purgas. He pushed me to start working on it. It started as kind of an exercise as that Steve Reich thing was... I did that in an afternoon for the fun of it but the Congo thing... I imagined it would take a couple of weeks but I ended up spending the best part of a year on it. I was falling into different rabbit holes, it became a little world of its own. When I was 95 percent finished I got so sick of it I didn't  do anything with it for almost a year before I sent it to Yves [De Mey] and Peter [Van Hoesen]. I wasn't sure if I wanted to release it.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/201431810&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>The other thing you said in your RA interview is that you were surprised there wasn't more discussion around the idea that it was appropriating Congolese music. Do you think there should have been more discussion? Was that something Yves and Peter thought about?</strong></p>\n<p>We talked about it. Archives Intérieures is a Belgian label and the original album is called <em>The Belgian Congo Record</em>. That's one of the reasons I decided to go with them for that record, because it's a Belgian label. I didn't expect it to take off the way it did... not at all! I didn't think anyone would really listen to it but I was expecting to get engaged in a wider debate and I was anticipating that. I think it's an interesting debate and I'm really open to having it. I don't have any answers either. I don't know if I've done the right thing.</p>\n<p><strong>It was something I thought about and felt the fact you kept the original track titles and made the context clear made a big difference. It wasn't like you were trying to disguise the origins of the project.</strong></p>\n<p>That was why I wanted it to be so open, to open up the debate around it. It took off way more than I expected it to. I did <em>Controlling Body</em> in 2012 and I actually finished it in January last year. I was expecting to put it out pretty soon after the Congo record. But it took off so much I kept on pushing <em>Controlling Body</em> back.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you end up working with Glasser? Were you producing for her?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, me and Henrik worked with her on her first album. We actually met when when we were playing with Fever Ray in New York for the first time. We clicked instantly, the three of us. We worked a bit on her first album, then Henrik moved to New York and they produced her second album together. After the Congo record I thought about how to turn that on its head, work in the opposite way. Everything on the Congo record is synthesised. I wanted to do the exact opposite, instead sampling loads of stuff, working with a lot of vocals.</p>\n<p>I talked to her about it when I was in Stockholm and sent her a score. I just wrote vowels and arrows going up and down and squiggly bits... It was very open and I had no idea how it would turn out. She recorded it in her flat in New York straight into her laptop. I used that recording as a sample bank and sent a bunch of words to her just to talk in and a couple of tracks have that text. Then I sent her the last track on the album. I had the idea that I wanted her to sing on at least one track. I sent her that and she sent it back within 40 minutes with the lyrics and everything. Again, she recorded it on her laptop alone in a noisy New York apartment. We tried to re-record the vocals but there was something really special about that original take. I did a lot of polishing and editing out car horns and stuff but in the end that was a magical take.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/245038376&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I also wanted to talk about the Hinge Finger release. I was kind of surprised by that: I wasn't expecting a Peder Mannerfelt 12&quot; on Hinge Finger. The track that's been previewed is great I really love it.</strong></p>\n<p>Cheers! Does it make sense to you that there's going to be a Hinge Finger release?</p>\n<p><strong>It does make sense now I've thought about it but at first I was surprised, partly because I haven't heard anything from Hinge Finger for a while. It kind of clicked with the really ravey thing that's going on in that track...</strong></p>\n<p>Well they haven't released anything for a couple of years. That's definitely the most DJ-friendly track on the release. I see it as an extension of the album in a way. It's just in a bit more of an ordered techno-framework. I used similar techniques in a way. To me it kind of fits but I always get excited by something new. It was a chance thing to be able to get something out on Hinge, it was kind of a dream come true.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8175/29106347011_b33a3f9432_b.jpg\" alt=\"u\"></p>\n<p><strong>How did you get in touch with that label?</strong></p>\n<p>Will [Bankhead] contacted me over Christmas, the beginning of the year. He sent me a message saying 'hi, if you ever want to do something together hit me up' and I didn't do anything then but later I did those tracks and thought about it... Where would I want to release these tracks? Hinge Finger would be fucking awesome. I sent them over to Will and they responded within the hour.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think a lot about where things are going to go? Like with the Congo Record you said you were keen to have it on a Belgian label.</strong></p>\n<p>Of course. I think about all of that. But it's always chance in the end - how things end up. I would like to be one of those artists that only releases on one label, but then again when someone says 'hi - do you want to do something', I get excited. For me, those years where I was really struggling to make music and trying to make techno but it was all shit, when I let go a bit and did something really simple is when all the techno producers came back and were interested again.</p>\n<p><strong>Thinking about it more, when I said I was surprised by the Hinge Finger thing... When you look at a label like Archives Intérieures I associate it with this slightly intellectual style. Various places you've released have maybe challenged the parameters of where your music can fit, where it seems to work from a listeners perspective.</strong></p>\n<p>That's good to hear. I don't want to be too stuck in a box going back to the Atonal thing. Not dissing anyone else but I don't feel comfortable just being another noisy techno bloke. Like with the track with Glasser, we were trying to do a pop song in a way! That's why it's called 'I Love You'...</p>\n<p><em>HINF8678 will be released in early September.

    "content": "<p>&quot;...entropy, fission, infinity, hell, silence...&quot; These are the words used by American composer Alvin Curran to describe the sound of an imaginary flight in his 1994 liner notes, accompanying a performance of <em>Inner Cities</em>. In the same liner notes, he muses on what sound might be like at the Earth's core, a theme which has been picked up on for the latest dispatch from Lucia H Chung's 'en creux' project, <em>Inner Geography</em>.</p>\n<p>Comprised of a single, 25 minute track, the release is a gradually unfolding storm of static blasts, disorienting feedback loops and visceral sub pressure. Pulling off a single track release of this length is an ambitious task by any standard. The best examples are usually heavily improvised, such as the crumbling opener to Vladislav Delay's  <em>Visa</em>, or Shotahirama's masterful glitch excursion,  <em>Post Punk</em>.</p>\n<p>The improvisational quality allows Chung to segment the release, presenting different approaches in a single work. The release is book-ended for example by sounds similar to Ryoji Ikeda's formidable, stone-wall electronics: ruthlessly precise and undeniably physical. Cleansing blasts of sub and clipping static are oddly calming despite their force. For the most part however, the release ebbs and flows like some kind of hypnagogic illusion, various segments disintegrating into one another. There is a Radiophonic Workshop feel to Chung's grating feedback loops. Sharp reverberations and swelling drones place the listener in  cavernous underground settings, so vivid you can almost feel the damp air and icy stone.</p>\n<p>Arell, the imprint which <em>Inner Geography</em> finds itself on describes itself as 'a label based on some simple ideas'. In many ways <em>Inner Geography</em> itself is based on some simple concepts (improvisation, minimalism, entropy) in thermodynamics referred to as a property's tendency to decline into disorder. As usual, the music of en creux is powerful <em>because</em> of its simplicity, not in spite of it.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/275938517&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>You’d be forgiven for assuming there are several Mark Fell’s performing music, making films and exhibiting at galleries. There probably are other Mark Fell’s, but the one we spoke to is quite a prolific one, and quite hard to define too. Across a variety of aliases and collaborations, he operates somewhere between dance music and the visual arts. From the almost-house of his Sensate Focus project and SND collaboration with Mat Steel, to his spatial sonic arrangements with FM synthesis pioneer John Chowning, the Sheffield based artist is forever blurring boundaries and raising questions.</p>\n<p>With Adrian Sherwood at the controls in the background, we spoke to Mark at Terraforma Festival in Italy, the morning after a brutally loud performance as Sensate Focus. A look around the audience during the set showed half elated and the other half looking confused. We chatted about this project, as well as covering his compositional techniques, his collaborations, his recent engagement with radical feminism and finally, the influence that Sherwood’s own productions have had on him.</p>\n<p><strong>So I thought I’d start off by asking about Sensate Focus as project. Could you tell us what distinguishes that from your other work.</strong></p>\n<p>Well, when I started doing it, I’d just done this track with Terre Thaemlitz (DJ Sprinkles), and I kind of liked the idea of doing a remix of it. So the first Sensate Focus thing is a remix, sort of, or a different version of the thing that me and Terre Thaemlitz did. At that time the key difference was that it would be all made in a timeline editing environment, like Logic or Pro Tools, all just using a cursor tool to draw notes in. So most of my work is kind of algorithmic systems in Max MSP but the Sensate Focus stuff was like, I can’t do anything algorithmic, I’ll just use the pencil tool to draw the notes in, and it was meant to sort of sound a bit like house music, or a bit more like club music as opposed to weird fragmented stuff.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/92038297&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Right, so everything we heard last night, each of those notes you’ve drawn in individually?</strong></p>\n<p>Well actually, the live version of this project has gone through a few different versions. So in the first version I took those patterns and then built a system to play the patterns in Max MSP. And then that version there is basically the patterns recreated in a grid in Max MSP. So it’s essentially like a grid of drum sounds and a keyboard sound as well. So there are no real algorithmic processes, but it’s on a grid rather than a timeline.</p>\n<p><strong>In terms of the performance last night, and I believe with other performances you do, in a way there almost isn’t a performance from you. With just the laptop and the enormous mixer, it’s quite cryptic what you’re doing. For you is this an intentional detachment from traditional live music or is it more pragmatic than that?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, what I don’t like is when performers really go over the top with gestures. If they want to do that, that’s fine, but I don’t like it. I went to see some classical music recently, and all the violinists were kind of moving their heads [gestures dramatically], and it seems totally unnecessary to me, all of this body language around it. And it’s the same with people stooped over laptops. That started happening in the late 1990s, people started stooping of laptops, and it was always some guy kind of going like that [does impression], and I just thought it looked so horrible, do you know what I mean?</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/105220028&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>It’s more of a token performance, that kind of set.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, so I just decided not to do that. And then a lot of the music that I’m into, like I’m really into Indian Classical music, and if you look at the way that’s performed it’s often people that are very static. So there’s this really energetic thing with people just doing it [playing the music], while static, and I just prefer that. Also, I’m not interested in portraying ideas of having fun or anything, if you know what I mean. It might be fun, but that’s up to the audience to decide. I’m not going to start trying to convince them to be one-way or the other.</p>\n<p><strong>I suppose DJ Sprinkles does a similar thing, where she’ll stand behind the decks, play deep house for two hours and not really interact with the audience.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, but I think, cause me and Terre are quite good friends, I think that position is sort of, you know, he’s sort influenced me and into that position, and we’ve kind of got there together in a way. But definitely that’s influenced me as well, I think.</p>\n<p><strong>So I wanted to know a bit more about your compositional process more broadly. Across the work I’ve heard, there’s quite a small pallet of sounds, and yet there’s this kind of constantly evolving music. I wanted to know where these sounds come from; if they’re samples, software, FM synthesis etc. and then whether it’s a challenge to use this very small palette of sounds to create stimulating music?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, different projects have different collections of sounds. Typically, what tends to happen is that there’s percussive stuff and a kind of chord type thing happening. With the early SND stuff it just became a rhythmic pattern and a core pattern. The kinds of sounds, like the <em>Multistability</em> album I did on Raster Noton in 2009/10, that was again essentially two kinds of sounds: rhythmic sounds and pitched chorded sounds. And for that project for example, the drums sounds were like quite carefully chosen to refer to a specific moment in the development of club music. When house music first started happening in Britain, and in America, but the way I perceived it was that the early stuff still had this very kind of sharp kick drum sound, that was reminiscent of early 80s electronic music production. After that moment, it became a more deep, thuddier kind of 808, 909 sort of sound.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8202/29523147355_0b1eff3fd5_b.jpg\" alt=\"er\"></p>\n<p><em>Mark Fell and Mat Steel aka SND.</em></p>\n<p>For me that transition around 1986-87, from this is what a kick drum ought to sound like, to <em>this</em> is what a kick drum ought to sound like; that kind of cultural conversation, for me is a really interesting thing. I guess I also just like those sounds. It was one of the sounds at that moment in time, just before the 808 took over. In the pitch sounds as well, that’s all FM synthesis, and it’s all four-operator FM synthesis that was on a unit by Yamaha called TX81Z and a DX100. All the pitch sounds are all derived from those presets that are just tweaked a little bit, and again they were all really important in the first developments in house and techno music.</p>\n<p>There’s this track, 'Show me Love' by Robin S - it’s really famous and there’s a thing that goes [sings melody]. It’s a particular sound, I don’t know if you know it. It’s kind of a rounded, deep-ish sound. That sound originated on a DX100. So there’s like some earlier examples of it and this Robin S track was probably one of the most popular. But even today there are tracks that sill use that sound. It’s kind of tracing back the evolution of where that sound came from, where it started. It’s interesting. And I think on the DX100 it was called 'Jazz Org' or something, but it’s this really nice, round noise. And actually, is it Flanger? The group that were on last night?</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/193937268&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Yeah that’s Atom TM and Burnt Friedman.</strong></p>\n<p>They were even referring to it as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Yeah I thought it sounded kind of similar to what you’re using in your set.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah. So, yes I’m interested in the history of sounds. Their kind of cultural contexts and the iterations they’ve been through on various tracks. So it’s just that I like those sounds and it’s sort of a personal obsession I guess. But what’s happened over time is from working with just this kind of chord keyboard sound and rhythm.</p>\n<p>The work I do now, that’s been abstracted out even further into very linear spectral textures, so the keyboard sound has just become this long linear spectrum, with percussive and rhythmic events around it. It’s essentially two different forms of construction: frequency construction and rhythmic or time construction. It sounds a bit nerdy actually, but that’s my obsession, that’s where my head’s at right now.</p>\n<p><strong>And so what sort of tools are you using in the studio to end up with this music?</strong></p>\n<p>A lot of the time I use Max MSP, which I always use to generate rhythms. Like one thing I just did with… Do you know John Chowning, the guys that invented FM synthesis? He invented FM synthesis in the '60s and it got licensed by Yamaha and developed into DX7 keyboard and the TX81Z and the DX100 came from that.</p>\n<p>So I met John Chowning, when I was at Stanford doing a show over there and asked him if he’d like to make a piece of work together, and he said yes. We just performed that piece in Berlin earlier this year. It was essentially FM synthesis textures done in Max MSP, so long kind of sustained FM synthesis stuff. It was played over eight speakers so it was spatially arranged. The rhythmic stuff was from a single speaker on stage, so there’s no spatial arrangement of the rhythmic stuff. So you’ve got these frequencies arranged in space, and rhythm that’s not arranged in space, but in time.</p>\n<p>Sorry that did not answer your question… So the tools are either kind of synthesis algorithm that I develop in Max, or just keyboard sounds and then algorithmic processes that I’ve made in Max.</p>\n<p><strong>Am I right in thinking that you build your own hardware and software?</strong></p>\n<p>I don’t build hardware. I’ve never studied computer science, I never studied music. I don’t know anything about that. My kind of initial encounters with making electronic music were drum machines and old analog mono synths. If you got me a bit-modular synth I'd kind of more or less understand it, roughly, without having to read the manual, but it tends to be all done on computer. I learned Max just by using it.</p>\n<p><strong>I wanted to talk about your influences. In your show last night there were snippets of multiple kinds of dance music genres, primarily UK ones. I felt like I heard rhythms resembling garage or bassline maybe, dubstep, acid house, maybe footwork? Are these things that are directly influencing you and you insert them in your own music or do they just kind of come out of these algorithmic structures?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, first of all I don’t go out to clubs anymore. I do end up in clubs because I play there so I am sort of aware of what’s going on but I’m not like I was around 1995 for example when I would have known exactly what kind of record came out that year, who did what, what was the best sound… you know what I mean. I’m not obsessive about these things anymore. If you said, name the best footwork producer, I’d probably say something like RP Boo because he is the only name I know.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/157871538&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>It’s not something I’m heavily involved in, but nonetheless I experience it and I think there’s a lot of amazing dance music that is being made. So I’m more in the position now of someone on the outside. And even in the '90s, I was on the edge on that scene. I was going to clubs, and it was a big thing that I did all the time, and the music was completely important to me but I never took drugs so I was always stood at the edge, just observing and listening. I was always in this position that was a bit remote and analytical and I guess that shows in the music I make.</p>\n<p>It’s not just normal dance music. I guess that position has stayed with me, and I’m probably more removed from those things. I think the music coming out of clubs is amazing. But I’m not in that anymore if you know what I mean. All the stuff that I make, none of it is a regular 4/4 tempo. Imagine a drum, it might have got 16 divisions in a loop… The stuff from last night might have 30 or 80.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8551/29504469385_a2cd7c6455_b.jpg\" alt=\"fell\"></p>\n<p><em>Mark Fell at Terraforma 2016.</em></p>\n<p><strong>One of the things last night was that it was really hard to find where the bar starts or ends. At one point I was thinking… are they even any bars ?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah it’s just one loop basically. If you listen to a lot of non-western music, it has that more kind of fluid time structure. Not just Indian music, but for example Australian aboriginal rhythmic music, the rhythmic structures are totally amazing. And not just this kind of regimented grid… I just get bored of that.</p>\n<p>The software that I developed for last night’s performance, there’s a series of steps but each step can be a different kind of ratio to some sort of fundamental tempo. Each step can be faster or shorter but still related to a tempo. One bit can be a triplet for example and the next step isn’t. You get this really kind of weird outcome, it sounds great on hi-hats.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/216580296&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I know when you’re patching in Max you can use randomness as a function to create random pitches or to choose which rhythmic structure you use. Do you use anything like that or is it more calculated?</strong></p>\n<p>Nothing from last night was random. It might be that, let’s say they are five options, five values, and I choose those randomly. But randomness, it’s not really that interesting I think. The only randomness was that I couldn’t remember what some of the things might have sounded like.</p>\n<p><strong>So I wanted to talk about your collaborations a bit. The recent ones I’m aware of include DJ Sprinkles, Gabor Lazar, and also the Okkyung Lee one that we saw at Café Oto. I wanted to know what motivates your collaborations and whether it’s different depending on the collaboration for example. I suppose everything DJ Sprinkles does is very embedded in their political believes whereas with Gabor Lazar it’s more about his production and sound design?</strong></p>\n<p>When I first started making music, it was always collective so I was always working with someone. It made it a bit easier and I was probably not as confident. It was hard work and just having someone to have a laugh with when you’re doing something makes it more fun. These days, I guess its just elements of Terre’s production that I like. I was around at his place in Tokyo and I said “let’s do this”… so that was just because we were at the same place at the same time.</p>\n<p>Similarly with Gabor actually, I was in Budapest and he said let’s make a record together and I could see how that would work quite easily. It was like “I’ll just generate some rhythms and synchronise his sound to it etc.” Collaborations are good because one thing that’s unusual about the music industry is that collaboration is quite a common thing, whereas the fine art world, or the visual art world doesn’t necessarily allow that. You don’t get filmmakers collaborating in a new film that often for example. There’s one director most of the time. Music is good because it allows that, I guess it’s always interesting to see how your process fits with someone else’s process, and how your kind of aesthetic choices fits with someone else’s.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/203317348&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>It seems like it’s more personal and out of circumstance, than a political motivation…</strong></p>\n<p>It’s hard for me to distinguish between the two really. I made a film about feminism recently. I made a collaborative piece with this guy Luke Fowler, a filmmaker. We both worked together on this documentary film about the history of feminist photography. We looked at this feminist photography project in the north of England, but one of the things that these women in the '80s would say is that you can’t divide the personal and the political… It’s a bit the same for me.</p>\n<p><strong>And I’m sure Terre Taemelitz would say the same…</strong></p>\n<p>Yes! So it’s difficult… politics kind of finds its way into everything I think.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8420/29413338522_96bbb6e37f_z.jpg\" alt=\"o\"></p>\n<p><em>Mark Fell and DJ Sprinkles' Tony Benn sampling 'Fresh Insights EP 2'.</em></p>\n<p><strong>On that note, I understand that engaging with feminism through producing this film led you to invite a woman artist onstage instead of you. Could you explain a bit about that?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah so what happened is that I’d just made this film, which was really controversial, working with these women who’re now in their 60s and 70s, who were doing this project in this radical sense in the early 1980s. So making the film involved meeting these people, and gaining their trust to some extend. I would say that I’ve always tried to avoid being misogynistic for example, but it’s never been a problem for me that if I turn up at a festival, it’s all guys. But after meeting these women, I realised that it was a problem… why is it all guys and what’s happening here?</p>\n<p>Being friends with Terre, he’d be saying similar things and I just thought about how you wouldn’t accept a government that is all guys or a law firm that’s all guys so why is it alright in music? And this London based artist called Richard Sides made a film about me, Theo Burt, Lorenzo Senni And EVOL, so all four guys. He did a project at the ICA to invite us all to perform, and I refused to do it because I thought it was like some boys club, and I don’t want to be part of that. There’s a London based cellist called Lucy Railton and I asked her to perform my piece, and that’s all the story was. It was just a woman instead of me basically. And it’s not solving anything or something but it was designed to highlight the fact that there was some kind of thing going on there.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/193058104&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>It’s interesting to hear about your relationship with Terre… I imagine you agree with the politics but what does it mean for you the idea of not being present on social media or on Youtube, or on Soundcloud, not considering that music is a mass produced good, this kind of rhetoric…</strong></p>\n<p>Well I don’t do any social media, I don’t have Facebook, I don’t put anything on Youtube, Soundcloud... A promoter the other day was asking what Soundcloud thing I wanted to use and I said I don’t have Soundcloud. But if someone posted something by Terre he’ll pursue it and shut it down which is fair enough. I mean I think both Terre and I grew up at a time when electronic music was hard to find. It was a full time job to go to record shops and record fairs. It was a marginal activity, for kind of weird kids I guess. I’ll release things, for example, in limited forms that sell out instantly and are really hard to find just because it’s nice to make people work to actually get something.</p>\n<p>The internet’s great and I wouldn’t go back to the pre-internet days, because that was horrible. It’s just great to be able to find stuff and do research and communicate and stuff. For me personally, because of the way I grew up it was like oh yeah there’s this limited edition record, there’s 200 copies of it, and my mission for the next six months was to find a copy of that record. I guess I just have fond memories of that. It was kind of quite good in a way.</p>\n<p>A good example was Psychic TV. So one of Psychic TV’s records was released for one hour on Christmas eve, so you had to go into the record shop at this specific time, wait for the record to be put in the rack and then it was deleted an hour later… and I got one. I wish I had a well-defined reason for keeping stuff limited but I don’t, I just like it.</p>\n<p><strong>One of the final things I’d like to ask is about the Okkyung lee collaboration and how that came about?</strong></p>\n<p>Well Okkyung was doing a residency at Café Oto and I had done a thing at The Serpentine with her and Haroon Mirza, and we got on, and then she just invited me to do this thing at Café Oto. I’m not an improvising musician, I’m from a visual art background, and Okkyung said we’ll just turn up and see what happens and I was like no, we need to plan what I’m gonna do and what you’re gonna do. So I set up a few things, and some of them worked and some of them didn’t, but the one that was interesting is this piece where I play a rhythm on headphones that she wears, so she can hear it, but I can’t and the audience can’t hear it either.</p>\n<p>It’s a really simple rhythm, it’s just five steps, and each one is an integer multiple of a base value. It might be multiples of a thousand milliseconds, and so I might go like 3, 3, 3, 4, 2, 1 or something and you get a rhythm. But when you change one slider the whole lot changes because it all extends. The idea is that the musician follow it as accurately as possible and then when I change one slider they get stuck and you can hear them getting stuck and sort of falling over trying to find where the rhythm is again. That worked out quite well I think, she was really into it. She actually said later it was the hardest thing she’d ever played. She really felt she was playing for her life and was totally scared.</p>\n<p>I think it’s really interesting to deconstruct people’s musical education and techniques. Since then I’ve done it with a violin player called Laura Cannell and a viola, and then with a pianist. It was full on grand piano and we did this experiment. It’s going to get released on this label Tapeworm, a cassette label. It should be out soon I think.</p>\n<p><strong>Well following from that, what can we expect from you for the next six months?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m doing loads of commissions. I haven’t released a solo records for a long time and I keep telling myself I want to do it. Every January I put aside four or five weeks to do a solo record and I just end up watching daytime TV. I’ve got a project in India where I’ve been invited to collaborate with some Indian musicians. But that won’t result in some sort of collective jam session. I want to actually learn Indian compositional techniques and just see where that goes.</p>\n<p>Also I’ve been invited to Iran, to Teheran, to do a project over there, and I’ve got various exhibitions. I’m doing a project with Oren Ambarchi, Will Guthrie and this Egyptian Oud player at the ICA on the first of September. So I’ve got loads happening, plus residencies as well, so I’ve not really got time to do a solo record, but I really need to do one soon, it feels like I’m ready to do one.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/11294561&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Great! I think that’s everything, unless you want to add anything?</strong></p>\n<p>Also I wanted to say that Adrian Sherwood was a massive influence on me. When I was into electronic music when I was a kid his work around 1985-ish was completely amazing.</p>\n<p><strong>He always did kind of dub and reggae stuff but at that point was he doing post punk things as well?</strong></p>\n<p>Well there was a phase around this group Tackhead, that was Keith Leblanc and he released a solo album called Major Malfunction, which Adrian Sherwood produced, and then there was this group Mark Steward and the Mafia… It was this big mix of people that all seemed to merge in different forms.</p>\n<p>I was trying to explain to someone this morning that if there was a Nobel prize for music production, he should win it. His work is totally amazing… I was sat next to him for breakfast and I was too scared to go and say hello. He’s totally brilliant and probably the two or three people that I would say were most important in my career in terms of influence.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/206473553&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p>There have  been several facets to the career of Susanne Kirchmayr, aka Electric Indigo. Beginning her work as a DJ in the early 1990s, the Austrian born producer worked at the iconic Hardwax store in Berlin, delivering a number of her own thundering 4/4 warehouse jams at the same time. In later years, Kirchmayr's style has diversified. She has worked on sound installations and theatre based projects for example, receiving the 'Outstanding Artist Award' from the Austrian Federal Ministry for Education, Arts and Culture in 2012. Her most recent 12&quot;, the HET released 'Seven' EP, sees a meeting of these two worlds, treading a line between the dancefloor and the avante-garde.</p>\n<p>The EP's opener 'sept' defines this best; digital bugs, broken glass glitches and pulsing modem tones creating oddball poly-rhythms between Kirchmayr's low-slung woodblocks and penetrating kicks. The track is beautifully understated - its sauntering, velvet grooves lending impact in place of exaggerated bass weight or over-the-top percussive climaxes.</p>\n<p>Kirchmayr's  second original, 'siete', recluses into the shadows. Industrial blasts of sub feel oddly cleansing in their forcefulness, echoing between teeming digital abstractions and discordant metallic swells. Gentle patters of timpani give the piece an almost neoclassical feel, working to something which can only be described as an anti-drop; Kirchmayr drops out the track's surrounding textures, leaving you in isolation with hollow chimes and resounding low-end.</p>\n<p>On the flipside we are treated to two remixes of the EP's opener, one from Spanish producer Héctor Sandoval aka Tensal, and the other from label founder Hagen Richter. Sandoval's version recasts the original into a trembling mass of bass weight and tightly clustered percussion, barely breaking formation across its six minute duration. Kirchmayr's granular manipulations are stretched to create an agonizing build in the track's center, yet Sandoval stays true to the original's restrained appeal. Holding back from a high-impact drop, the original components are handled with respect and a light touch.</p>\n<p>Hagen Richter turns in a slightly more dramatic re-imagining, introducing harshly phasing snares and a pointed bassline amongst hisses of static and percussive flourishes.</p>\n<p>Kirchmayr's release makes up only the second from the Berlin based HET, despite the short catalogue however, the label is already showing a strong propensity for brooding, sound-design heavy techno, with the sharp edges left in.  We look forward to seeing how the project develops.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/171541403?color=ffffff&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"361\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>It would be hard to give any extensive history of electronic music without making some recourse to Don Buchla. A pioneering engineer, Buchla shaped the sonic world that we currently live in. In particular, the Buchla 100 and 200 series came to define a generation of synthesisers. These were among the first synthesisers to be built and unlike Moog, they came without any standard black-and-white piano keys. This set the Buchla series apart from any other instruments made hitherto. They were synths made as they ought to be: ultra-modern, experimental and alien.</p>\n<p>Buchla’s notoriety first became apparent with the release of <em>Silver Apples of the Moon</em>, the first piece of electronic music ever commissioned by a record label. Written by Morton Subotnick on the Buchla 100 in 1967, its influence is truly immeasurable. But to simply canonise <em>Silver Apples</em> as just a curious historical artefact would be a mistake. Listening today is still as trippy as it must have been 50 years ago. There is almost no repetition and no discernible structure. The harmonics are peculiar and the rhythms are uncanny. It simply presents the listener with a set of expressionist forms, there to be freely interpreted. Funny to think that The Beatles’ <em>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</em>, released in the same year, is still regarded as ahead of its time. The work of Buchla and Subotnick outstretch the so-called radicalism of 60’s rock by decades.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/116940773&color=000000&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>Laurie Spiegel once wrote that when she first heard the Buchla, “Music went from black-and-white to colour.” At the time, Spiegel was living in the heart of avant-garde 60’s New York. This was the era of Steve Reich, Pauline Oliveros and Terry Riley; of minimalism, modernism and movement. “You were making the sounds yourself,” Spiegel continues, “as opposed to writing them down on a score and then hoping you could persuade a conductor and an orchestra to turn them into sound. You could immediately hear the realisation of your ideas.” This is the very essence of Buchla’s revolution. Much like early computers, synthesisers held a price-tag affordable only to rich bohemians and universities. But the Buchla required no classical training and no ensemble. An entire universe of sound could be made with one instrument and one player — an innovation unmatched by any instrument since the piano.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8057/29661597231_e0bf178673_h.jpg\" alt=\"buchla\"></p>\n<p>It’s no secret that gender has often been a barrier to music resources. Even as Director of the San Francisco Tape Music Centre during the 60’s, Pauline Oliveros remembers having to return at night to the abandoned studio in order to freely experiment. During this time, the composer and improvisor (now well known as the founder of Deep Listening)  produced two of the most impressive pieces on the original Buchla Box 100 in partner with her tape delay system. Outside the window of her studio, she could hear the loud croaks of frogs in the pond and as she started to play, these sounds organically came to materialise in her work. These Buchla-born creatures swirl around her space-age sound world and get interrupted by the gentle voices looping off the tape machine, gradually building into an aggressive echo. These extended pieces (28/33mins) act as a reminder that electronic music can fall neatly into the human realm: they represent the natural way many Buchla artists work with their instrument.</p>\n<p>The immediacy and intuitive nature of the touch sensitive Buchla were also the elements that first intrigued the classically trained composer, Suzanne Ciani. Working a day job in Don Buchla’s workshop and a regular face at the San Francisco Tape Center, Ciani is largely responsible for bringing the sounds of modular synths in general to popular culture. The 80’s were packed with her video game and advertising campaign sound designs, like the notorious sound of the Coca Cola bottle being opened and poured. For Ciani, the Buchla was an instrument like no other. She often left it running for months at a time to compose sounds and predicted that households of the future would each have their own Buchla.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/225359332&color=000000&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>Buchla synthesisers have made an unexpected return from Italian musician, Alessandro Cortini. Any good introduction to Cortini starts by sitting down and playing the entirety of his Forse Trilogy. An epic series that marks the producer’s shift away from his industrial rock band, Nine Inch Nails, towards a piece made (almost) entirely on the Buchla Music Easel. The trilogy allowed him to study changes in the sound of each note, through filters and oscillators, and how the dense textures could create a compelling track without traditional melody or tonal harmonies. Cortini’s work shows how deceptive the small keyboard of the Easel is. Each approach to the Buchla is one of experimentation and intrigue, one which can’t be laden with anything preconceived.</p>\n<p>This year, Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith reappropriated Buchla synthesis for a new purpose. Beginning her career as a folk-musician, Smith swiftly abandoned the genre when introduced to the Buchla by a neighbour, becoming “distracted and enamoured with the process of making sounds”. This year, she released EARS, an album carrying the Buchla out of the stuffy indoors and into the outside world. Here, the Buchla is reinvented yet again, as an instrument of natural and organic beauty. Using granular synthesis, Smith distills her voice into woodwind tones and soft vocoder. The result is a lush and meditative record, miles away from the steely environment of Subotnick’s studio. Such is the elasticity of Buchla’s inventions.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/247845405&color=0b0b0b&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p>Short run vinyl is a tricky business. In our own endeavours, we've often been advised pressings of less than 200 is a pointless excursion, financially speaking. One workaround is lathe cutting. In this process, each individual disc is cut separately, rather than cutting a master plate, which all the other records are pressed from. New York founded ICM, or 'In Context Music' learnt this lesson early on, limiting their releases to lathe cut series numbering just 25 from the very first release, as label owner Angus Tarnawsky explains.</p>\n<p>&quot;I first encountered lathe cutting through the work of Peter King&quot; he begins. &quot;I immediately liked that by default, lathe cuts are produced on transparent discs.  At first, cutting on lathes seemed like a smart financial decision but I soon realised that compared to vinyl, it isn’t necessarily that much cheaper.&quot;</p>\n<p>The main draw for releasing lathes for Tarnawsky was the aesthetic, but as well as the thick, clear plastic they are cut on, the method of production makes for an interesting differentiator. As Tarnawsky puts it, &quot;it’s a great way to attract attention to challenging artistic content.&quot;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8021/29422523831_a4b58ac2b7_b.jpg\" alt=\"s\"></p>\n<p><em>Lathe cutting.</em></p>\n<p>Founded by the Australian-born artist in 2013, ICM was set up shortly after his relocation to Brooklyn NYC. He made the move after receiving a scholarship from the University of Melbourne for his research into hybrid instrument design, as well as being offered the opportunity to play with Apache Beat. &quot;It was a fantastic experience and something that has profoundly changed my outlook on music&quot; he says of the experience. &quot;It really set the tone for everything that I’ve done ever since.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;I remember arriving in the city during the middle of a snow storm and almost immediately, heading out to a punk show. Every week, I rode my bike to Gowanus where Apache Beat would rehearse in a basement studio that used to be owned by Brian Eno.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;For the first couple of years, I was absorbing so many new things every single day and saying yes to every opportunity. To go from a point of geographic isolation to being at the center of the world is a big change. Of course, you sometimes need to take a break from that kind of situation to gain perspective on what is most important for your practice.&quot;</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/111273052&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>Sonically, ICM focuses on electro-acoustic oddities of all manner; from the plaintive harp manipulations of Shelley Burgon, to the dry, uncooperative percussive excursions of Parisian artist, monotope. There's also been lo-fi amp experiments from Che Chen, sounding like the off-cuts of a Dirty Beaches record, as well as a trilogy of 7&quot;s from the man behind Driphouse, Daren Ho,  showcasing a series of oddball modular reductions.</p>\n<p>&quot;I just follow my own instincts and trust my taste&quot; Tarnawsky replies when asked about the curation of label's sound. &quot;I like the idea of something new – not necessarily the first time that something has ever happened, but the first time that the featured artist has touched upon a concept within their own work.  Given that angle, it makes sense that style, as a whole, is less important for ICM than for some other labels.&quot;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7721/29394027952_3926419e24_b.jpg\" alt=\"w\"></p>\n<p><em>Shelley Burgon at MoMA PS1 // Photo by Brett Messenger.</em></p>\n<p>Talking in more detail about the label's founding, Tarnawsky is keen to stress the importance of his collaborators. &quot;I wanted to create an outlet to unify several different layers of my own creative practice&quot; he begins.  &quot;Something that as a whole would be greater than the sum of the individual parts. After working through many different ideas, it dawned on me that forging a curatorial relationship with other artists and starting a label would yield something really special for everyone involved.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Every release on ICM is personal. There’s no one involved that I haven’t met and for the most part, I’d like to keep it that way. monotope (from Paris) was a special release as I found his work online, released it not knowing him but eventually, we had the chance to meet and play some shows together in London and Berlin.&quot;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8156/29465215531_d21b8cbf66_b.jpg\" alt=\"q\"></p>\n<p><em>Daren Ho's ICM005.</em></p>\n<p>The labels aesthetic, is another area in which Tarnawsky seeks to involve outside influence. &quot;That was something worked out alongside a good friend, Jordan Dolheguy at Totem Visual&quot; he says of ICM's artwork. &quot;We’ve known each other for a long time and when starting out, I’d got to the point of designing the logo and the art for the first release but was feeling frustrated with getting the feel right for a poster promoting a series of launch events. I emailed Jordan asking him to look over what I had and he was really generous and was not only able to refine the poster concept, but helped establish the core visual language that has been evolving ever since.&quot;</p>\n<p>Despite the involvement of contributing artists however, ICM is still very much bound to Tarnawsky's own availability and resources. In his own words, that explains why ICM &quot;fluctuates from very busy to very quiet.&quot; ICM's activities had to be put on hiatus for a year or so most recently. Alongside the practicalities of his relocation to Canada, Tarnawsky is also involved in a wide-range of other projects, making it impossible to pursue everything at the same time.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/151858653&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>As far as the future goes though, Tarnawsky is open to the possibility of an expansion. &quot;In the future, it’d be great to assemble more of a team to help with daily operations&quot; he suggests. &quot;I really love all of the artists I work with and it’s fantastic that they are always on the same page as me. I appreciate and thank them for everything that they bring to ICM.&quot;</p>\n<p>Speaking of his other projects, our first exposure to Tarnawsky's work was not through ICM, his work as a session drummer or research based projects, but his solo EP for Tom Dicicco and AnD's Inner Surface Music. Entitled 'Pitched', the 12&quot; covered four disjointed percussive abstractions, part hollowed out 2-step, part Autechre-like experimentalism. Pressed on his relationship with Inner Surface, Tarnawsky speaks of their continued interest in his work. &quot;Initially, I met Andrew [Bowen] by pure chance when I was on tour in the UK&quot; he explains.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8403/29468356306_ec219dae5e_z.jpg\" alt=\"t\"></p>\n<p><em>Angus Tarnawsky live // Photo by Tim Griffin.</em></p>\n<p>&quot;We stayed in touch over the course of a year before putting things together for the Pitched EP. We’re still in frequent contact and I’m really excited about presenting another full-length release of my work in the not too distant future. Tom and I have spoken a bit over the past few months as well about some US touring together as he’s never played out here. In general, given that we all live in different places, I’ve been lucky to play shows and hang out quite a bit with all the guys including one really special show in 2014 where we all shared the bill at Soup Kitchen in Manchester.&quot;</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/267939327&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>As well as another Inner Surface release on the horizon, and following an interim at the Red Bull Music Academy in Montreal, Tarnawsky is planning a return to New York sometime next year. &quot;It will be great to reconnect with the city and continue to build on my work there&quot; he says of the return to NYC. &quot;ICM will resume normal activities around that same time and I am very excited that some backlogged releases will finally see the light of day alongside a new 7” from Brian Chase and a truly remarkable release featuring content curated by the wonderful Maria Chavez.&quot;</p>\n<p>As you would expect from the collective approach taken with ICM, their events have also formed a big part of connecting is contributors, and Tarnawsky sees plenty more opportunities opening up in the future in this regard. &quot;I’m looking forward to organizing a few events in Vancouver before the year is out. There’s a great store here called Selectors’ Records that frequently hosts shows and I’m working to arrange an event series to coincide with a new batch of ICM releases.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;From the beginning, I’ve viewed ICM as a collective, and events have been a big part of building that community.

    "content": "<p>Following an invitation to play Les Orgues festival, drone outfit Saåad gained access to the Puget organ of Church of Notre-Dame de la Dalbade. This organ, a Frankenstein creation of added features and rebuilt tidbits, functions as the centrepiece of their latest work, <em>Verdaillon</em>. Although designed to play French 19th and 20th century classical, Saåad carry this instrument, with its creaking tones and blaring resonances, into the 21st.</p>\n<p>Saåad’s back catalogue is unapologetically gloomy and mournful. Descending from Toulouse, the duo specialise in billowing clouds of sound that engulf the listener. They also employ intriguing techniques to experiment with space. Most notably, their last record, <em>Deep/Float</em>, took inspiration from a series of experiments in which the duo played three giant horns against a cliffside in the Alps. This fixation on natural spaces follows right through their work, from muggy caves to frozen mountains and misty forests.</p>\n<p>On <em>Verdaillon</em>, Saåad take the listener into the stony centre of church, a mysterious space where the air hangs dead and cool. The sounds inside possess an austere simplicity, as if made by dusty hurdy-gurdys and broken harmoniums. Even the album sleeve looks like a Victorian postcard from an antique shop. Moreover, nothing is erased or edited from the recording process. You can hear the squeak of floorboards overhead and distant tolling bells.</p>\n<p>But as the album closes, Saåad reach biblical levels of grandeur. What sounds like an advancing army comes ever closer to the doors of the chapel. It’s as though <em>Verdaillon</em> documents the last days of a fallen hero meeting an inevitable end. And the end does not disappoint. The final stretch of the record, ‘Vorde’, is a spectacular onslaught of sound, nakedly displaying the harmonic scope of the mighty pipe organ. As Saåad destabilise the foundations of the church, its pillars begin to cascade.</p>\n<p>Listen to <em>Verdaillon</em> in full <a href=\"https://saaad.bandcamp.com/album/verdaillon\">here</a>.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/101911599?color=ffffff&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"100%\" height = \"400\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.thefader.com/contributor/simone-steenberg\">Simone Steenberg</a></em></p>\n<p>I don’t think anyone expected the new wave of club music to sound like it does. Fuelled by the Janus parties and Bill Kouligas’ PAN imprint, today’s club climate is a bubbling cauldron of emerging styles. It offers a refreshing break from the dogmatic insistence of 4X4 and the machismo of modern techno. Alternatively, we find sound effects, trance and a newfound queerness. Much of the uneasiness of the genre seems to be born out of the seeming never-ending clamp-down of nightclubs and parties. Techno and house no longer express the felt antagonisms surrounding modern clubbing. Thus, this as-yet unnamed genre has emerged in its stead.</p>\n<p>Although Lotic, M.E.S.H and Kablam are recognised as pioneers of the sound, it is far from developmental completion. Toxe in particular has surfaced as an emerging talent in the last 12 months. Last year, she released <em>Muscle Memory</em>: an EP drawing from abstract grime melodies and mechanical shudders of rhythm. She also gained considerable attention earlier in the year for her contorted remixes of Britney Spears’ ‘Toxic’ and Slipknot's 'Psychosocial'. This month sees the return of Toxe to nascent Swedish label Staycore alongside Berlin producer Timu Tokdemir, aka Mechatok.</p>\n<p>The opening section of Still Life sounds at once computerised and antiquated. It's as if MIDI software were playing an ancient Greek funeral song. The marriage between the past and future seems to be a recurrent theme. Look, for example, at the artwork for this release: sci-fi word art inscribed on a time-worn Roman column. Toxe’s grime influence is especially present here, the opening fugue could even work as a Ruff Sqwad instrumental. But the serenity is soon lost as the track zooms into blaring trance-hall and rave synths. It's important to remember with this lot that no matter how far they stray into abstract territory, the dance floor is never out of sight.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/283946721&color=0b0a0a&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photos by Matthijs Diederiks</em></p>\n<p>A musician and visual artist in equal measure, TCF's work cannot be meaningfully divided across mediums. His experiments in sound and vision are part and parcel of the same aesthetic enterprise, but it's one which teems with creative diversity. The majority of his work centres on complex systems and the question of what constitutes ‘us’ in relation to technology. Rather than providing a clear demarcation, TCF illustrates the impossibility of disentangling the two. He employs novel production techniques (spectrograms, algorithms, coding) to exhibit personal details to his audience: passport details, credit card information and, in his latest project, his own genome. Even his musical biography is somewhat peculiar — early productions can be traced back to Craxxxmurf: an abandoned moniker under which he produced twisted R'n'B mash-ups.</p>\n<p>When we meet he has just finished his soundcheck at TodaysArt festival in The Hague. He’s told the sound engineers that he’ll need to be given time warnings for when his set is supposed to finish. “I’ll be fully in the zone. I probably won’t notice the time’’. It doesn’t take long to realise this is how he approaches most things: he has an obsessive personality. At his hotel room, he takes out a travelling tea kit and advised me that drinking tea that is too hot can lead to cancer. “I just read a report on it”, he tells me. “I’m obsessed with facts. I spend all my time reading science reports. I don’t watch films, they don’t give me enough information.” Holdhus seems to have one of those minds that simply can’t sit still. “I’ve tried taking a holiday”, he explains, “but I just got out my computer before too long”.</p>\n<p>The acronymised alias TCF stands for a paradoxical mantra: The Contemporary Future. It’s difficult to refer to TCF’s ‘real name’ since it is frequently altered on legal documents. In an interview with <em>Fader</em>, he revealed that the name on his passport was an anagram of Lars ‘the contemporary future’ Holdhus: Aedrhlsomrs Othryutupt Lauecehrofn. Perhaps unsurprising then, that TCF is not much of a public figure. Even the marketing of his own work is seemingly <em>anti</em>-public. Take a look, for example, at any one of his titles, spelled out in incomprehensible streams of code. These sequences might mean something intimate and personal, but we cannot say. This is the ambiguity that makes TCF’s work compelling. There is a perpetual feeling that something immensely private is being communicated, but in a language impossible to decipher. He even designed a chat-bot that responds to commands in mystifying numerical code and images. Yet despite a resistance to the public eye, today TCF seems to be looking for some kind of spiritual reset. “I’m trying a new approach” he tells us, “that’s why I said yes to this…”</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/195341920&color=003aff&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>You were speaking earlier today about decentralising data and power distribution. How does that feed into your work and interests?</strong></p>\n<p>A lot of my artistic and musical based practice is about the relation between chaotic structures and centralised power. I’m interested in how they interact and where one can place oneself within it. Cryptology has obvious connection to power. It is about power, the essence of it is power, or protection against power, a negation of power... I always consider my use of encryption as a sort of shield against power, but it’s also a kind of gaining power. I create my own world and place it in the public realm, but no one can get full access to it apart from me. You create this kind of container that’s existing in society, but it’s not fully integrated. I guess my interest is in creating states with more distributed power. I mean, I think that’s one of the contributions that one tries to achieve. The more you get into it though, the less you believe it, I think.</p>\n<p><strong>Are you still into it?</strong></p>\n<p>I don’t know anymore.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think at the start you were trying to gain power?</strong></p>\n<p>No, it was more research; how you can move around society and build this world that sometimes interacts with society. A coping mechanism. Most of my interests are so narrow, so niche, so I don’t expect people to have the same passion for it. Like tea. I think it’s nice to serve people tea but I don’t expect them to be like ‘Oh, OK!’ and then go home and read five books about it.</p>\n<p><strong>Would it be fair to say you’re more interested in things at the periphery of music?</strong></p>\n<p>Maybe I’m not a musician. Maybe I finally have to realise I’m not a musician. I’m someone who learned the system of music and I found it interesting for a while, but I don’t really see it developing, I’ve lost interest in it. I struggle with my interest with music, it’s probably the reason why I’ve considered quitting music so many times and still consider quitting everyday because I just don’t see the point.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is that?</strong></p>\n<p>There’s not much technological development in music, since the computer arrived, I would argue. But people would say I’m wrong. You can record this in that way and then it’s just a question of how you compose it together, which doesn’t really interest me because the potential was in the computer already. I think my interest is computers, not the music that comes out of them. I started by generating these funny algorithms which would generate thousands of possibilities. I set it for a whole night, for example, and it would generate 14,000 kick drums. What do I do with 14,000 kick drums?</p>\n<p><strong>What’s your interest in data? You use a lot of personal data in your work.</strong></p>\n<p>My relationship to data is a very strange one I think, but I don’t know if you can really have a ‘relation’ to data. In my latest project I went to Hong Kong to sequence my DNA and I will publish the entire reading of it so everyone can download it and do what you want with it. You know how every composer’s dream is to think ‘oh now I made some really great music’, but this is something that I cannot really control. I can control the publishing of it, but I cannot control what people will find in it. I like it as the self portrait that nobody can control, not even myself. If science developed further they might find more in my DNA that I didn’t know was there and that would change your idea of me. I like that it might affect my life in way that I’m not aware of. It’s not music, but my interest is not music in that way. My interest I think is in the feedback you get in this world, by strategically placing things in the world. So I place this DNA here for you, and you choose your actions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8508/29490796504_8b38836f69_h.jpg\" alt=\"tcf\"></p>\n<p><strong>Do you ever think about how you can make a performance or presentation more in line with your work?</strong></p>\n<p>These things always have to be very staged, and then I don’t like them anymore. Early on, I started to get into whether I could get a virus and just play music on people’s computers but it would be imaginary, you couldn't measure it — you wouldn’t know their reaction or feedback — which is part of the fun. Like when I invoice people, my PDFs have sound, but I’ve never heard anything back, so I don’t know if it’s ever really happened.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s interesting because your work is very niche. Is it ever problematic when people are not informed about your practice?</strong></p>\n<p>In general, lots of people comment on the quality of the sound being not so good. Lo-fi digital is something that people can’t handle. Like ‘ah, this sounds bad, 192kbps, why don’t you give me a wav?’ I’ve always been fascinated by that. That’s how the world looks to me, it doesn't look like a shiny wav or flac. So for me it never made sense to present the world in that way. I imagined my own death (I have a weird relation to death, I spend a lot of time imagining it in funny ways) and one thing I imagined was that people would remember me as a low quality mp3 file. It would be all kind of crackly and ugly. That’s what you would remember me as, and I think that’s beautiful. That sort of weird vision is something that I’ve brought into my music and exploited to the max, because I think it’s interesting, but people completely misunderstand that idea. If you’re this hi-fi guy or technophile who just bought these really expensive speakers, then to you it just sounds crap. If you look a little deeper at my practice, it’s about that side of the world: digital artefacts crashing. Not in the usual harsh brutal way, but in strange ways. It adds to sound but maybe not in ways people want to listen to. Another communication problem.</p>\n<p><strong>You’ve been advocating for a user centric system when it comes to music archiving, sharing etc. Is the future of music via the blockchain?</strong></p>\n<p>I see the need for those things but I’ve already given up on the idea. I feel as though music is stuck in technology. I think we need to either alter ourselves or we have to allow other things the capacity to listen to music, like machines. If we alter ourselves I think music would take a drastic turn, because so much is built on our ears and brains, and the limitations of our bodies. We could also start to make music for machines, or for other species. Imagine: clubs would be built differently, everything in society would be different, it’s just these parameters that we’ve exhausted.</p>\n<p>Computers interpret music very different from us and so do animals. There is this prevailing notion that since we are humans and we have emotions, we should only care about that. I think it’s very anthropocentric. I understand that humans make music for humans, but I still think it’s limited in its scope and its scale. If we were to explore music in the fullest sense, I don’t know if we would still call it music. I mean, maybe it is just ‘sound’. For me, it doesn't really matter if it’s sound or music. It’s one thing. I think our brains are constructed to create these narratives all the time, which I think is really boring. If sound is physical, why do we focus on listening to it? Why don’t we look at it, feel it. What I am doing, and people like me are doing, there’s not really much economy for this, so there won’t be so many people involved in developing it, so recently I’ve been looking into other businesses.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/176387478&color=0066cc&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>What sort of other business?</strong></p>\n<p>Like finance. It’s way more interesting! People might call me a douchebag for saying that, but I really don’t care anymore. When I look on Facebook and there’s some event referring to spectral music as a new trend… a ‘new’ trend? I just think, well, what am I doing? And that’s really sad. Sad for me. It’s not like I look down on all the musicians out there, I’m nothing better! What I created was very personal, and maybe that made it unique, but I don't think it had much technological advancement. I used what was there and I just tried to find things that hadn't been fully explored yet. That’s what I’m currently working on, bringing those things together with art.</p>\n<p><strong>Is that how you got interested in A.I?</strong></p>\n<p>I think we are so far away from A.I. in terms of music. Recently, someone published this new song which was like a Beatles rip-off, made by an A.I. It was like the first song made by an A.I. but because it was just a pop-song sung by humans, it just sounded like a bad Beatles song. I mean, seriously? An A.I. could create very interesting art, but no one would be interested, we want human. It’s just mimicking, why do you need computers to do that? It’s not utilising their potential at all. You create really complex systems to mimic things like this? Why? No one would really have an interest in the other results, which is why it’s not happening.</p>\n<p><strong>So do you seriously consider dropping music forever?</strong></p>\n<p>That’s my current struggle, which is sad because I love what I’m doing, but I don’t see the economical sense. You either compromise and do things people will appreciate, or you do things you like to do, or you quit. I’m seriously trying here, but nothing is working. I feel really lost. Now I’ve said I will do a bunch of stuff, like this series for PAN, if that doesn't work, then I’ll do something else. Why expend so much time and money? Do you know how much money it costs to sequence your DNA? In Europe, 10’000€. And I’m publishing this for free. This sort of project is a money drain. I could choose to not do this sort of project, but it’s my interest, it’s really my passion, but now I can’t see that it can come to anything.</p>\n<p><strong>What about outside of music and work?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m not a very social person. I can spend lots of time on my own just doing stuff that I like. I have a lot of friends, and I meet with people once in awhile. But I could spend my whole time working, I wish I could, and one day I will. I tell myself ‘you just need to keep working’. But we’re in the worst time in history to do that, so then I’m like, no I should just find some other thing and just do this as a hobby. But I wouldn’t. I would just go straight into this other thing and disappear into it.</p>\n<p>I think for people around me it can be difficult. I know it is. I mean my friends know me and can appreciate this, but I think I am just not corresponding much with that side of society. I would just rather spend time with people and talk about specific subjects. If I meet with people it’s for a reason. I don’t ‘hang out’. I drink tea. I try and hang out, but I always fail. It’s a constant struggle because you do have to adapt to your surroundings. I could adapt if I could see the purpose, but I don’t see one there.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/73028057?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>You’re not wearing blue trousers… and I had it in my head you only wore blue?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, but then I went shopping with my mother. I’m not a functional person in many ways. She got me to try these on and I was like, come on, I’m not going to wear these... and then I tried them on, and I was like, “hmmm... pretty good”. I think a lot of people deal with that sort of scenario but not many people are open about it. The problem is that someone has to take care of you at some point. I don’t want to rely on other people taking care of me.</p>\n<p>I think similar people to me are often drawn together, or they end up back at home with their parents. Which is OK. I would be fine if someone would just pay my bills. I wouldn’t have a problem being maintained by others to just do what I do now. Maybe I should just get a normal job and then get a hobby. Music wouldn't be a hobby. I think I want to do Niwaki, which is where you trim Japanese garden trees to look like large scale bonsai. I want to move to the countryside somewhere, but I would need a living. That’s my biggest problem at the moment. If I find that, I will move, but again I would get stuck there working my whole life on this garden. It would probably be beautiful, but it won’t generate any income. I wouldn’t recommend this life.</p>\n<p><em>TCF will be performing a new project on DNA and identity at the ICA on October 5th.

    "content": "<p><em>Photos by Hortense Maignien.</em></p>\n<p>Meakusma is a name that has long been active in and around Eupen. A glance at their history of promotion shows 12 years of varied and thoughtful curation. They have also pushed a boundary-defying label which, since 2008, has been a force of carefully considered eclecticism releasing the likes of Ryo Murakami, Bryce Hackford and Madteo. This year saw their debut festival, a three-day event in the local cultural centre. In line with the history of the brand, the lineup itself consisted of a diverse range of artists, many of whom existed at the periphery of classification.</p>\n<p>Much of the festival existed as an alluring mystery which gradually unfolded over the weekend. The right approach to a festival like this is to take the plunge into the unknown. Simply allow oneself to be consumed by the incidental performances and artists you know nothing about. Tomaga for example dazzled with Can-esque grooves and warbling electronics. Lord Tang too delivered a theatrical performance, describing to his audience the building’s morbid history as a slaughterhouse. Later, Izabel Caligiore and Nosedrip were treating their audience to weirdo dance records and crate-dug treasures.</p>\n<p>Outside, you could find Wax Treatment’s own open-air showcase. Here, the system came into its own without the bare walls of Halle and in the capable hands of Mark Ernestus, Fiedel, Roger Robinson and friends. The Saturday afternoon saw an additional building, Heuboden, open up for a Dublab showcase. Here we caught ML playing a range of obscurities, and Kassem Mosse &amp; Mix Mup doing a second live show as ‘Chilling The Do’. Later on, Babyfather, headed by James Massiah in Dean Blunt's absence, delivered an intense rumination of police violence and racism in London. An acutely sharp production on a local experience of a global epidemic.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://c6.staticflickr.com/6/5162/30103911981_85a636b1ea_b.jpg\" alt=\"meak\">\n<em>Lord Tang</em></p>\n<p>With the Dublab showcase going straight through the night, Saturday slowly blurred into Sunday, where Heuboden continued to platform a comprehensive range of DJs and musicians until early Monday morning. Elsewhere, the varied programming was maintained, with highlights coming from Yves De Mey and a performance of Terry Riley’s ‘In C’ by the Christian Klinkenberg Orchestra. We ended the festival with ‘Call of the Deer’: a short minibus trip to the local forest, where we were led in the pitch dark to hear the mating sounds of deer.</p>\n<p>Meakusma’s programming was, for me, infallible, but it’s not the only thing that was on point. Eupen was an unexpectedly beautiful setting and the recently renovated cultural centre was a perfect space for the multi-stage festival. The fact that this was the first edition of the festival is all the more impressive and is a testament to the experience of the team behind it. Any music fan with a taste they struggle to define will have a hard time finding a more suitable festival than this one.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/281765249&color=000000&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>With a career spanning back to the 1990s, Mattias Fridell has become a name synonymous with consistent quality. Rugged grooves and stripped-down 4/4 are unified to create smouldering dub-warehouse trips, rich and atmospheric, yet firmly dancefloor-centric at the same time. His latest release, the Shape of Void released 'Formen' EP, opts for a different approach. Rife with teeming granular atmospherics, sub-pressure and feather-light melodies, the EP makes up his first ambient release.</p>\n<p>&quot;Mosaik from Shape Of Void contacted me in April to discuss if I would be able to create something for their label&quot; he begins when talking of the release. &quot;After some conversing, he mentioned the label's aim was to open a catalog of ambient and experimental creations. I figured it would be nice to finally make that ambient release I'd always wanted to, so I offered to make the first EP for the catalog. I ended up discarding hours of material until I was happy with these tracks. My aim was to do a very personal take on ambient and drone. There's a fine balance between loss and allure, constantly battling in the music. Hopefully I managed to get the mood right.&quot;</p>\n<p>Aside from his history creating techno, Fridell spent many years working as a sound engineer. This included working with live PAs as well as assorted studio work. These days however, his main source of income is mastering. &quot;It gives me another level of satisfaction&quot; he says of the practise. &quot;It’s so deep and nerdy, it suits me perfectly.&quot;</p>\n<p>A brief look through his Bandcamp page, 'MFSamples', reveals another of Fridell's talents. He has six packs available for public consumption here, yet his background working with sample libraries stretches back years. &quot;I have a colossal bank of samples dating back to the year 2000 or so&quot; he begins when asked on the topic. &quot;The thing is, I was actually contracted by a, at the time, pretty well known sample company. They vanished in their previous form and since I was still bound by contract I couldn't start working on samples for other companies until way later. Now I like to keep it to an underground way of working, and Bandcamp provides an excellent platform for this sort of business. Occasionally I recognize a sound sample I made in a track - mostly the stabs! Sometimes people send me music they made with my samples, which is something I appreciate. More often I get asked how some of the sounds were made. I always answer those requests, it’s the least I can do.&quot;</p>\n<p>For his contribution to our podcast series, Fridell decided to put together a live recording, rather than opting for his usual, DJ-based approach. &quot;When I get asked to record or contribute mixes for podcasts or radio shows I never record them in the studio, I always use recordings from gigs&quot; he says when asked about the thinking behind the podcast. &quot;However, I had none available in this case.  Since I was on this sudden ambient creation spree, I figured I would construct a live ambient set instead! That, and the fact that it’s not so generic to deliver specially tailored sets like these for music blogs got me going. I wanted to make something unique.&quot;</p>\n<p>Aside from the Shape of Void release, Fridell appears to have been keeping busy lately. I made an EP for a new label, District 66, entitled the 'Farsot' EP which includes a remix from Progression&quot; he starts when asked of future plans. &quot;You’ll hear a lot about that label sooner or later I’m sure. There’s another release for a topical Dutch label, Decoder Recordings, coming in a few months and finally I have a new EP coming out on Gynoid Audio’s LTD series, paired with remixes by P.E.A.R.L &amp; Antonio De Angelis.&quot;</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0066-mattias-fridell%2F&hide_artwork=1&light=1\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>It should come as no surprise that Anthony Child — better known as Surgeon — makes music beyond the confines of his trademark industrial techno. Child can now boast over two decades of honing his craft and this has made him a rightful heir to acclaimed status. But once you open for Lady Gaga, where can you go from there? Nowhere. Exactly. So where most would ride a glorious wave of techno super-stardom, Child has begun to explore the other corners of his creative imagination.</p>\n<p>Under his birth name, a series of oddities and collectibles can be found. Last year, he released an ambient album recorded in the Maui Jungle. Here, Child wired the humid air and deep colours of the environment into thick modular synthesis. Earlier this year, Child collaborated on a improvisational album with weirdo outfit GNOD: Salford’s answer to Can. The record itself released as a fundraiser to repair the roof of Islington Mill. This if anything should demonstrate Child's distancing from the dance floor. In an interview with The Quietus, he explained: &quot;To be honest, I'm much more at home [in Islington Mill] than in a nightclub...&quot;</p>\n<p>This new EP, a cassette limited to just 100 copies, reveals Child's inner hippie. The title track presents a stodgy synth raga nearing 20 minutes in length. Even by Child’s standards, it is maximal in its minimalism. Too aggressive as background music, too stark as a focal point. It exists in some curious netherworld. It’s like the sound of a synthesiser left over night, humming in its idleness. As each repetition of its warbling sequence passes, the sludge seeps deeper into your cranial nerves. As Rrose put in a one line review: “It feels like this music has been injected directly into my mind...&quot;</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3457348785/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://frequencydomain.bandcamp.com/album/you-have-already-surrendered-your-total-will\">You Have Already Surrendered Your Total Will by Anthony Child</a></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>The latest instalment of our podcast series comes from Punctum: an emerging duo whose attention is fixated on repetition, reduction and hardware. Punctum formed through a shared affection for synths that defined a generation: the 303, the 606, the Buchla. During a residency at the legendary EMS studios, Punctum recorded their debut record: <em>Remote Sensing</em>. This is a curious album for many reasons. Nothing about its ‘inherent’ musical structure is new. There are no fancy production techniques or juxtaposition of styles. No dazzling displays of technology nor in-your-face theatricalities. Instead, one is simply invited to hone in on subtleties of tone and be subsumed by them.</p>\n<p>Too often, music that aims to commemorate classic synths carries with it a nauseating sense of sycophancy. Think, for example, of the worst excesses of solo synth-worship: acid house, Jeff Mills’ tedious 909 sets and Vangelis. Punctum stand clear of those excesses because there’s a never a sense of self-parody or synth-for-synths-sake. Their ethos rings more like Moodyman’s classic line, now immortalised by Blawan: “It ain't what you got, it's what you do with what you have / it ain't what you do, it's how you do it…” Ahead of the <em>Remote Sensing</em> premier show at Berlin's Spreefeld Bootshaus on Saturday, we caught up with Punctum to talk synths, sound and Stockholm.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about this project and how it all came about?</strong></p>\n<p>Ever since we were studying at the same Conservatory in Bologna we have wanted to collaborate. We were in love with the same artists and obsessed with the same synths. We even shared a common affection for minimalist music design and wanted to apply this compositional attitude to some of our favourite instruments. Namely, the TB303, TR606 and Buchla. Soon after meeting, we arranged an artist residency at the electronic music studios EMS in Stockholm, where we recorded our first album, <em>Remote Sensing</em>, in February 2016.</p>\n<p><strong>And how does it work between the two of you? I understand that you both have your own separate solo projects?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes we both have our own solo projects but since we share many preferences for musical concepts, it was very natural to collaborate. We both had musical experiences with early synthesizers and this lies at the core of our musical practice and deeply informs our mode of listening and composing. We were inspired by the idea of approaching the infamous Roland boxes with the same compositional attitude we developed on those synthesisers: playing the TB303 and TR606 as if they were early synthesizers, you know? This allows to the ear to uncover the naked solo voice of these synths and focus on the inner timbral qualities. By means of reduction and subtraction, the iconic sound of these silver boxes is virtually projected into an ideal desert. Where extrinsic links are hard to grasp, the perception of the sound-object itself is enhanced and refreshed, revealing new listening perspectives.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about how you got involved with Summe?</strong></p>\n<p>We have double LP coming out on Summe very soon. The label got in touch with us before this project was even born. We sent them <em>Remote Sensing</em> as soon as we got it. We appreciate how the Summe collective tries to remain obscure and preserve anonymity, not investing much on image and media promotion, but focusing instead on the quality of their records. They have released so much solo synthesiser music that we find inspiring and close to our sonic research, such as the work of Sarah Davachi and ∑.</p>\n<p><strong>We first heard the Punctum material on Maria W Horn’s podcast, I’m guessing you know each other from Stockholm?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, Maria and I [Caterina] attended the same Music University in Stockholm. We studied electronic music composition and became part of the burgeoning local musical scene gravitating around EMS and Fylkingen... Particularly the Stockholm Drone Society, a collective of artists focusing on slowly evolving timbral music. They've had several showcases at Norbergfestival and are now releasing on Maria’s and Kali Malone’s label XKatedral.</p>\n<p><strong>A lot of the material on <em>Remote Sensing</em> sounds improvised, like live jams on the various bits of hardware that you use. Can you walk us through how you two work on a track together?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, many tracks from <em>Remote Sensing</em> come from live jams. We basically set up our gear in the studio and started developing a common practice from improvisation, deriving our workflow from the design of the machines themselves but also from the emotional connection we have with those specific synths. Once you set a sincere emotional and creative feedback with the machine, the compositional process happens very naturally: it’s like entering the electromagnetic field of the machine and becoming part of it... Then it’s just a matter of tuning yourself to the ongoing electric stream and learning how to interact with it. Finding that sweet spot where the limits of your own ego and ideal projections don’t affect the limits of the machine’s design and vice versa. It’s like a mutual brain frequency modulation™.</p>\n<p>In this sense, collaborations allow for the possibility of filtering out individual ego in favour of a common denominator, one which makes mutual intersection possible. On a more specific level, we have been working a lot with melodic pattern repetition, using delay as the main constructive tool for generating our compositional design. Through multilayered delay lines and resonant chorus effects, the recognisable Roland sound signature turns into an hybrid where the culturally established source is dramatically blurred. The choice to limit the sound palette of such a legendary timbre further reinforces the subversion effect of sound disembodiment and revisionism.</p>\n<p><strong>How about your live shows, how do they work?</strong></p>\n<p>In the live set we bring the same gear we have been working with in the studio, playing and processing patterns from the TB, TR and Verbos Harmonic Oscillator through a complex chain of delay based effects. The only thing missing from the original setup is the Buchla 200 series that we used at EMS to expand the sonic palette of the Roland machines. Unfortunately, we cannot take that one to shows (eheh...)</p>\n<p><strong>Finally, can you tell us a little bit about the podcast you have recorded for us?</strong></p>\n<p>In this podcast we simply wanted to feature music from masters of solo synthesizer music united by a strong sonic investigation of isolated timbres, who inspired our own practice and work...</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist</strong></p>\n<p>Cyrus - Recall [Basic Channel]<br>\nSarah Davachi - Olsun [Summe]<br>\n6k - Tighter [Pi Recordings]<br>\nRobert Aiki Aubrey Lowe - M Bondo [Type]<br>\nRhythm &amp; Sound - Carrier [Rhythm &amp; Sound]<br>\nø - Roentegen [Sähkö Recordings]<br>\nF.U.S.E. - Nitedrive [Warp]<br>\nCOH - 06 132 [Editions Mego]<br>\nAlessandro Cortini - La Sveglia [Hospital Productions]<br>\nPunctum - Uncharted [upcoming on Summe]<br>\nEleh - Sleeps Golden Drones Again [Important Records]<br>\n∑ - 2.45 [Summe]<br>\nCatherine Christer Hennix - The Electric Harpsichord [Die Schachtel]<br></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0067-punctum%2F&hide_cover=1&light=1\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Brooklyn based Nik Dawson has seen releases on both sides of the Atlantic. Many will know him for his stomping L.I.E.S. 12&quot;s, evoking sweat-soaked early hours on crammed dancefloors. He has also released taught 4/4 mindbenders with Danish label Nord and has a long-standing affiliation with Anòmia Records. The Barcelona based-label is run by Arnau Sala Saez, their wares including everything from cassettes and vinyls to shirts, posters and experimental films. At the time operating as 'DJ' Bookworms, Dawson provided an early EP in their catalogue, returning this year to release 'Standards of Beauty'.</p>\n<p>In many ways, the title sounds fairly unremarkable for a release in the abstract/electonic music sphere. In the accompanying text however, Dawson explains the reasoning behind it. &quot;In my mind, ‘Standards of Beauty’ refers to the restrictiveness of Western/European standards of beauty and the alternative realities and narratives that exist either indifferent to or defiant of them. It refers to the feedback loops that occur between those standards and their counterpoints, where the standard's inverse is fetishised. I'm thinking of existence in a weird universe within all of that - being told I wasn't black or white enough pretty much my whole life. Where is the standard there?&quot;</p>\n<p>Given the themes of battling for self-worth explored across Dawson's debut LP <em>Xenophobe</em>, it's little wonder Dawson has previously described the 'Standards of Beauty' EP as a &quot;companion piece&quot; to the album. Sonically, the release has both an isolated and unsettled feel to it, presenting four skin crawling technoid experiments that wouldn’t sound out of place on a Stroboscopic Artefacts or Cosmo Rhythmatic release. Take the restless granular march of '500 Wounds' or the title track's skittish modular hook. 'Patterned' on the other hand is almost comparable to the reductionist kick drum experiments of early Plastikman.</p>\n<p>Where <em>Xenophobe</em> felt outward-facing and charmingly raw, 'Standards of Beauty' takes a more cautious, and in some ways more introspective approach. It is as if the EP slowly gathers confidence from the delicate, reserved synth abstractions of 'Divulge', through to its pulverising closer. Dawson has crafted a release which hones in on some of the more interesting sonic themes of his earlier work, simultaneously having the bravery to mark the release with confronting personal experiences. A release which deserves both attention and reflection, for both its sonic content and the discussions which accompany it.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/280788357&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p>For almost two decades, Detroit Underground (DU) have been rewiring the circuitry of electronic music. A true multidisciplinary project, graphic design and electronic hardware are at the heart of the DU enterprise. Look, for example, at their interactive website, or their circuit-bending modular synth units. There's a sense in which defining DU as but a record label would be a mischaracterisation. It's a broader project, tying together disparate elements of art and technology.</p>\n<p>I first became aware of DU with the release of <em>Drudged Torn Routine</em>, a record of staggering complexity from Stray Landings affiliate, Yaporigami. Any further investigation through the DU back-catalogue reveals a daunting monolith of painstakingly curated music. One common thread that seems to run through DU is that it brings artists away from their comfort zone and into new experimental territory. You can find Kyle Hall doing glitch or a concept album from Oscar Mullero. This is the nether-zone that DU creates — pulling artists into deeper water to bring out their most exciting work.</p>\n<p>The latest DU release comes from Chris Randall, head of Positron Records and plug-in programmers, Audio Damage. Randall himself is something of a musical tourist, fronting Chicago Industrial Rock outfit Sister Machine Gun. But under his birth name, Randall has also explored blues and traditional American music. In a recent blog post, he even explained that he had been toying with the idea of using the mapped brain of a nematode worm as a musical instrument. Yet his compelling work stems from his secret love of modular synthesis.</p>\n<p>This new release, <em>Oscillator Breach</em>, stands in stark contrast with Randall's history in rock music. Rather, it sits more comfortably within the the roster of IDM resurgence. Rich textures pop in and out of the mix, shot through with surgical precision and scrupulous detail. The press release for <em>Oscillator Breach</em> is no less cryptic than the music itself. There is no description of the sounds, nor of the history of the record. Instead, we are presented with a stream of consciousness text that could read like a narration from Twin Peak’s Laura Palmer:</p>\n<p><em>“...They shared the smoke, passing it from one mouth to the next. Flicked the bloodstained filter into damp grass and pulled away. Headlights shimmering through fog, grinding gravel, the whirring end of a cassette tape, whispering woods. There is nothing safer than a coat of pine...”</em></p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3878324915/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://detund.bandcamp.com/album/oscillator-breach\">Oscillator Breach by Chris Randall</a></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>The label name 'Alien Jams' has never felt more fitting than for it's latest release, rkss' 'Cutoff' EP.  Making up the fifth in the catalogue on Chloe Frieda's radio station-come-record label, the 12&quot; takes you on a cosmic voyage, floating past distant planets with a child-like awe at the unknown.</p>\n<p>For previous releases, the London-based Robin Buckley has taken a rather conceptual approach. Their 'Tunnel' EP experimented with sampling randomly generated YouTube videos, while the Where To Now? released <em>Top Charted</em> abstracted well-worn EDM presets to create an experience like visiting Coachella on a heavy dose of LSD.</p>\n<p>In comparison, 'Cutoff' sounds like Buckley just having fun. The title track explores Night Slugs reminiscent percussive madness, cranky 4/4 thudding into oblivion. Box room reverbs and squealing modulations give the piece an invasive closeness, cracking snares and  blunt kicks bouncing off the walls brazenly.</p>\n<p>Other tracks find themselves in a state of delirium. 'Wave' sets intoxicating ripples of synthesiser against a bubbling soup of spring reverbs and tape echoes, discordant bleeps occupying the backdrop like a time-machine in a 1970's sci-fi flick. 'Load' on the other hand could easily find its place in a DJ Sotofett or Madteo mix, idle-minded basslines powering through windy layers of background ambience.</p>\n<p>Having been a follower of Buckley's work since their early releases, it is satisfying to see where their journey has taken them. As mentioned, the last few releases have seen Buckley move in a perhaps more conceptual direction, so in many ways 'Cutoff' feels like a return to his early 'Basement' and 'Submerged' EPs, but with refined purpose and sensibilities.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/281463103&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>For many artists operating in the avante-garde electronic music sphere, audiovisual performances or installation art seem to be something of a graduation point. Dasha Rush's recent <em>Dark Hearts of Space</em> performance at Unsound, or Peder Mannerfelt's technicolour acid trip displayed at  Atonal 2015 are case in point, as are the installation  pieces developed by the likes of Alva Noto or Ryoji Ikeda.</p>\n<p>One artist who has never separated the link between audio and visual performance is Dutch artist Mariska de Groot. Earlier this year I was lucky enough to catch one of her projects at Newhaven's Fort Process Festival. The billing saw de Groot operating a light and sound instrument she has created, which attempts to trace the orbit of 'Nibiru' - a planet which is said to pass our solar system once every 3000 years. Granular itches and grating drones soundtracked the swinging pendulums and spirograph like projections,  adding to the surreal, otherworldly quality of the piece.</p>\n<p>Through her work, de Groot has shown a keen interest in the history of electronic instruments, from the 1920s Russian avante-garde, to the experimentation of pioneers like Daphne Oram and Rudolph Pfenninger. Following the festival, I caught up with de Groot to talk lost planets, the 'instrument inventors initiative', and the possibility of a Mariska de Groot retrospective in 2032.</p>\n<p><strong>I enjoyed your performance at Fort Process a couple of months ago. Was that the first year you've been? Who else did you enjoy seeing there?</strong></p>\n<p>I had a great time discovering noisy treasures in the reverberating setting of the fort! I’ve seen Sculpture and Pierre Bastien performing a few times now and although I know what to expect I always enjoy it a lot. I was very surprised about the performance from Ewa Justka. She played one of the best noise performances I’ve seen in ages - very intense.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you explain a little bit more about the 'Nibiru' project for those unaware? The projections trace the planet's orbit right? How did you first hear about it and where did the idea come from?</strong></p>\n<p>As I was developing the pendulum instrument I became aware of its cosmological power. When I was searching for the meaning of what the instrument wanted to tell me, I realised it must be the orbiting of a lost planet that it is trying to trace. Since then I have been in conversation about the position and movement of Nibiru.</p>\n<p>Nibiru is a lost planet that’s never been discovered. It passes our solar system every 3000 years they say.</p>\n<p>Me and my instrument are trying to understand how Nibiru orbits. By capturing light and sound we create a drawing of the planet. Every time, Nibiru seems to make slight changes in its movement. I am starting to think Nibiru dances a galaxy old choreography.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/164528364?color=ffffff&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>One of the things I enjoyed about your performance was the closeness of it - maybe it was just because of the smallish space but it felt like the audience were really part of the experience. I was reading about your 'Murmur' project - how it reacts to the audience's movement. Is the idea of audience interaction/involvement something which you think about a lot?</strong></p>\n<p>Actually I don't work with the audience much, in an interactive way at least. Most of the time I don’t like interactive new media art as it is often more like a gadget than an exciting experience.</p>\n<p>In Murmur, the installation, the work was reactive of the movement of the visitors in a meaningful way. The sounds refer to the deep sounds of the earth or the murmuring during spiritual ceremonies.  By walking in circles, the water would follow you, provoking the experience of a ritual.</p>\n<p>In my performance work it works slightly differently. I’d like to have the audience as close as possible connected to the playground. I see the walls of the space where I perform as the housing of the machine I operate. The audience is the Wabi-sabi of the piece.</p>\n<p>Without the audience, it is as if the machine is brand new, straight from the factory, with the smell of newness and no flecks of dust. In a tight space with a large audience, the machine gets hot and dense on the inside, resulting in an intense experience. In big spaces it is possible to spread out and there’s space to show it’s beauty.</p>\n<p><strong>There were some audio-visual installations at Brewer St Car Park from Carsten Nicolai and Ryoji Ikeda last year. I remember being struck by how some of the projects stretched back to the '90s but were still being booked for display in 2015. What's your take on this? Is Nibiru something you can imagine performing in 10, 20 years time for example?</strong></p>\n<p>Wouldn’t it be nice, a 'Mariska de Groot Retrospective' in 2032?</p>\n<p>Some of my instruments are suitable for development and research over a longer period of time and I can imagine I’ll still use some of my instruments in 15 years, but in revised ways. I'm not sure about Nibiru, but it would be great to show it again then!</p>\n<p>My works are about phenomenological experiences and I use materials from different periods. I think they’re quite timeless in that sense and stay interesting. A lot of my work might be still relevant. I wonder how I would look back then, on how I made things and played them now.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5755/30203967144_7219356fa9_z.jpg\" alt=\"q\"></p>\n<p><strong>I noticed you have mentioned the work of Daphne Oram in a couple of places - did you manage to check out the Mini-Oramics machine at Fort Process?</strong></p>\n<p>Of course I had to see the mini remake of my hero's work. Great to try it out also! It's not easy to draw something that makes sense.</p>\n<p>However, Daphne’s version - the Prototype Deluxe if I may say - is much more charming and has much more soul. It was made over many years of research and material finding.</p>\n<p>In 2014 I was in London for Nime and managed a super quick visit to the Science Museum where the Oramics machine was displayed. I had forgotten about its display there, so I was enormously excited finding it. It was beautiful to see how the components are build into the closet she used to house it. You totally grasp the energy and focus she had working on it. I find the inventor's prototypes much more interesting than the spick and span industrial designs, but maybe I'm just a slight sucker for nostalgia.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the arts scene in the Netherlands like? Do you find most interest in your work comes from abroad or are you booked for many performances locally?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s a bit of both. Of course there’s a different perception of art between different countries, but I’d like to think a bit more global. My work finds interest in the fine arts world, the sound art world, the media art world, the [electronic] music world… There’s sub cultures within sub cultures.</p>\n<p>The problem so far is that my works are too big to bring with me on a flight, transport is often costly. So most of the time I’m booked in a radius of 800km, a distance I can easily drive. I wish I could go overseas though. I also wish to make a suitcase instrument!</p>\n<p><strong>You presented CineChine at ADE recently. Can you tell me a bit more about the thinking behind it and its connection to the Russian avante-garde in the '20s?</strong></p>\n<p>When I started my research on optical sound I stumbled on the comprehensive history of the first synthesizers in the 1920s Russian Avantgarde and the fascinating stories of their inventors, all collected and written out by Andre Smirnov. The A.N.S. Synthesizer, the Rhythmicon and the Variophone were a big inspiration, but I was sorry the magic of light being sound was so tiny and hidden in a machine and me being so big. I decided to create an instrument that explores optical sound in a more physical and syneasthetic way. Using the walls of a room as the casing, in Cinechine [the installation version of the instrument Lumisonic Rotera] you're entering the inside of the machine where light and sound are the same naturally.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/149665162?color=ffffff&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>What's next for yourself? Any new projects/performances coming up you are able to tell us about?</strong></p>\n<p>I just started a research period, meaning I’m at the very beginning of many new fascinations and new works. That’s exciting! I’m also working on a experimental silent movie piece with iii [instrument inventers initiative], the artist collective.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you first become involved with them? Tell me a bit more about the project.</strong></p>\n<p>I'm one of the founding members. We're a group of instrument makers that all graduated from the ArtScience interfaculty at The Hague. Our performances often have an ideal timespan of 20 minutes which sometimes makes it difficult to get gigs in the right setting. We decided to create our own platform to present our programs and tour around like a circus. Soon we grew into a full organisation. Now we invite artists for residencies at The Hague, produce new works and curate bigger programs and exhibitions that also involve artists outside iii.</p>\n<p>We all work in the same field and a lot of us have a same kind of aesthetic, but we're all working with different senses, methods and materials. I see many works developing from the start and it is interesting to be so close to someone else's research on - for example - how smell gets on the stage, how taste works with sound or how the body can be used as an instrument.</p>\n<p>Sometimes we get the chance to create collaborative work. In 2015 we created a kind of 'gesamtkunstwerk' for a big church in The Hague, called 'Rites for a New Utopia'. We used the building for a series of new works melted together to become one long evening filling piece. Starting with a piece of 'our' Lars Kynde for the carillon at the top, bringing overtones of the bells to the belly of the church with a piece of Angel Faraldo. Slowly we worked through an installation of Matteo Marangoni and a light and sound performance by me, Dieter Vandoren and Matteo Marangoni towards the altar where Horst Rickels played his beautifully made Mercurius Wagen. Different pieces became one whole concept and experience.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/138447062?color=ffffff&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Rick Bahto</em></p>\n<p>There are two ways to approach psycho-acoustics. You can, 1) Study the perception of sound or; 2) Create sounds to alter perception. Ashley Bellouin does a bit of both. Having worked with both Dave Smith and the late Don Buchla, she is a disciple of radical electronics. She recently designed her own instruments, most notably a variation on Benjamin Franklin’s glass harmonica and a curious structure known as HEADPSPACE: a hexagonal cylinder suspended by strings, amplifying the vibrations of wind. So in this sense, Bellouin falls into the first camp.</p>\n<p>But she is also a musician in equal measure. Lifting ideas from psycho-acoustics (spatialisation, beat frequencies, auditory illusions), she implants hallucinatory effects within pieces of introspective drone. Not as a novelty, but as an artistic device. Just as her instruments aim to displace traditional forms of listening, the music of Ashley Bellouin requires a special kind of ear. One that is robust to mystery and transfiguration.</p>\n<p>Her debut vinyl, <em>Ballads</em>, presents two sidelong pieces, 'Bourdon' and 'Hummen', pieced together like clasped hands. 'Bourdon' takes as its focus a harmonium and the mellifluous Sequential Prophet 6, an instrument Bellouin helped to develop at Dave Smith. 'Hummen' by contrast explores the extraterrestrial frequencies of her custom-build glass harmonica. She is also joined by Ben Bracken and Teddy Rankin-Parker, embellishing the pieces with tones from electric guitar and cello, respectively. Although seemingly minimal in composition, an attentive listen to this album reveals painstaking micro-tonal and harmonic shifts that creep steadily into ear shot. Unsurprising then, that this was not the product of some spontaneous live jam, but the conclusion of a three-year project.</p>\n<p>Music like this puts a time-stamp on the now. It staves off the future and widens the present. It makes possible the ability to observe ones surroundings  by bringing the world closer to the mind.   I therefore believe that the name ‘Ballads’ must be being used with some level of irony. Although there is plenty of romance in this music, it’s a far cry from the pompous sentimentality of narrative opera. It's not recounting unrequited love nor dwelling in nostalgia. Where ballads adopt a garish, undignified display of emotion, <em>Ballads</em> meditates in patience.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2710263556/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://drawingroomrecords.bandcamp.com/album/ballads\">Ballads by Ashley Bellouin</a></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Christina Nemec and Peter Rehberg have known each other for some time. As well as playing together in Blackest Ever Black outfit Shampoo Boy alongside Christian Schachinger, Nemec has seen releases on Rehberg's Editions Mego imprint.  Their latest collaboration together as 'Chra &amp; Pita', comes in the form of a 7&quot; single for the Trost Jukebox Series.</p>\n<p>I have found Nemec's work somewhat difficult to pin down previously. Her 2009 LP <em>Derive</em> for example has the scattergun structure of a hip-hop mixtape, tracks like 'Säkenoivästä' evoking early Kyoka releases with their playful use of vocals and buoyant hooks. Her most recent LP on the other hand, <em>Empty Airport</em>, is more akin to the work of Pan Sonic, or something you might find on Ukrainian label Kvitnu.</p>\n<p>Rehberg's back-log is perhaps slightly easier to gain hold of. His 1995 EP with General Magic is comprised of scratchy electronica and funk-tinged glitch, while later releases resemble the styles you might find on Mille Plateaux. Most recently he released <em>Get In</em>, an Editions Mego LP which aligns these different approaches alongside a healthy dose of shoegaze ambient.</p>\n<p>On this release, Nemec and Rehberg evoke the computerized aesthetic of someone like Gábor Lázár, combining intense, gothic atmospheres with distant synthetic melodies. A-side 'Cynthia' places stuttered bleeps alongside squealing modulations and slow rises of static, tasteful phone-line abstractions disorientating the listener even further in the track's latter half. 'Not My People' on the other hand deploys grumbling radiophonic swells of low-end, time-stretched sci-fi stings adding a sense of creeping discomfort.</p>\n<p>The duo have carved out a niche for themselves which makes an impressive start for their debut collaboration (in this form at least), combining Nemec's mastery of volcanic noise and drone textures, with Rehberg's penchant for digitized oddities.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/291111078&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Stefano Majno.</em></p>\n<p>Italian artist Alberto Rosso, aka Morkebla has both an eye and an ear for the futuristic. His <em>Ono-Sendai Cyberspace</em> LP, was littered with references to William Gibson's <em>Sprawl</em> series, setting the context for Rosso's data-moshed beat experiments. Even from the title of his most recent offering, it's clear he hasn't changed interests. <em>A Field of Secondary Craters</em> sees it's release on Edinburgh based Czaszka Records, following several months of encouraging discussions. &quot;I was contacted by the label in Spring 2016,&quot; he begins when asked about his contact with the label. &quot;I was already working on some material and finally ended up sending them some tracks. They showed huge interest and support, which is something precious. I love to work with labels who are truly passionate in their work and follow every release very carefully - Czaszka is surely one of them.&quot;</p>\n<p>Rosso says the album is an assortment of tracks constructed across his life, rather than a snapshot of a particular moment in time. The release's name is an attempt to reflect this. &quot;I imagined how the music could be transposed into a visual metaphor&quot; he states. &quot;It could be like a small planet with different craters over its surface. A few days later, I was looking at some pictures taken by NASA satellites, and found one picture that had exactly the same name, <em>A Field of Secondary Craters</em>&quot;.</p>\n<p>His interest in space and sci-fi extends back to childhood, adopting music production as a pastime around eight years ago. &quot;I was mainly into experimental sounds and field recordings&quot; he reflects on his early days of production. &quot;Then I focused on more rhythmical, non-dance ambient music. I think my tastes haven't changed that much over years, because I have always enjoyed a wide-range of genres. I have become quite picky with what I buy and listen to, especially because it’s getting more and more difficult to find sounds that you don't forget easily.&quot;</p>\n<p>The mix he has provided for us covers three quarters of an hour of amp-textured synthetics and leftfield beat experiments, providing a cross-section of Rosso's recent listening habits. &quot;I wanted to focus on a short time retrospective with some of the music that strongly shaped my last few months&quot; he starts when asked about the mix's construction. &quot;But whenever I began to focus on it, I kept on losing track of what I intended to do. Then I started to imagine this mix as a painting; it’s full of chiaroscuros from each track. Whether you’ll like it or not, I think it represents 100% what Morkebla is now.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist</strong> <br></p>\n<p>S Olbricht - Floa 1 [UIQ] <br>\nUMFANG - Riffs [1080p] <br>\nWolfgang Tillmans - Make It Up As You Go Along (Salem Remix) [Fragile] <br>\nStavrogin - Tailgate [3BS] <br>\nBeatrice Dillon - Curl [Alien Jams] <br>\nBlindoldfreak - Everything Ends Here [Modular Brain] <br>\n2814 - Inside The Sphere [Dream Catalogue] <br>\nMorkebla - The Ground Under My Feet Became Water [Czaszka Records] <br>\nBody Boys - Syringe II [Indole Records] <br>\nSecret Boyfriend - Little Jammy Centre [Blackest Ever Black] <br></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0068-morkebla%2F&light=1\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>It all sounds a bit precious bodily fluids from the title. The themes of Cold War angst in Stanley Kubrick's masterful satire, <em>Dr. Strangelove</em> might not be a bad place to start in fact when talking about 'The Rise of Liquid Alternatives', the latest release from Brussels-based Orphan Swords. Making up the debut offering on 'Nurse', the EP is packed to the brim with paranoia and disturbed mechanics.</p>\n<p>Orphan Swords was formed in 2013 by Bozar Music &amp; Arts Festival founder Pierre de Muelenaere and Yannick Franck, the owner of the Idiosyncratics label. The pair have become something of an artist's choice when it comes to the industrial/techno crossover, perhaps best illustrated by their collaboration with cult New York darkwave band, Ike Yard.</p>\n<p>While remaining firmly in keeping with their back catalogue, there are some new nuances to this latest release. 'The Risk of Liquid Alternatives' has a sharper, more precise feel to it when compared to the ramshackle drums of a release like <em>Weehawken</em>, a mini-album released earlier this year.</p>\n<p>'Glaysa Labolas' for example sees razor-edge glitches and pointed blasts of sub almost reminiscent of something from Senking, or Alva Noto &amp; Byetone's Diamond Version project. By the end however the track has been doused in echoes and reverbs, clattering percussion and wailing vocals moving the offering into hallucinatory realms.</p>\n<p>The release's second offering, 'Forneus', takes a more leftfield approach still, reverberating plastic drums pummeling out low hollow resonances alongside groaning synthetics.</p>\n<p>As a debut offering from Nurse, 'The Rise of Liquid Alternatives' makes a promising start. Orphan Swords' amalgamation of crisp, mechanical electronics and something more wild and unrestrained positions the label to move in a number of different directions, and I'm greatly looking forward to seeing which path they choose.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"250\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/256947192&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Paul Jebanasam’s accent tells me he was brought up in Australia long before he mentions his route to Bristol came via Sydney. He laughs whilst narrating the move as a fresh start; “no one knows who you are, you can reinvent yourself and do what you’ve always wanted to do, and you have a lot of time because you don’t know anyone.” And, although Bristol seemed like the fitting location for the dubstep sound Jebanasam was associated with as half of Moving Ninja, it’s here that Subtext originated in 2004. Between Jebanasam, James Ginzburg (Emptyset) and Roly Porter, Subtext has found itself falling through the margins of electronic and instrumental composition. Releases that appease an audience looking for something a little beyond dance music, often called experimental, but quite simply, artists that just embrace sound in its art form.</p>\n<p>As we sit down to talk, the ‘big ideas’ I understood to be behind <em>Rites</em> (Jebanasam’s debut solo album) and <em>Continuum</em> (his second) began to tumble out through daily experiences and familiar questions. Each a product of an artist that is dedicated to continuous learning and exploring, from sacred music to electroacoustic work and sound design. The night before I had my second experience of <em>Continuum</em>, performed as a collaboration with Dutch visual artist Tarik Barri, a name that should be familiar for his work with Thom Yorke, Monolake and Nicolas Jaar. With the performance fresh in my mind we talked science, origin myths and the search for comforting answers.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=177430082/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://pauljebanasam.bandcamp.com/album/continuum\">Continuum by Paul Jebanasam</a></iframe>\n<p><strong>Can we start with <em>Continuum</em> and how the collaboration with Tarik came about?</strong></p>\n<p>The collaboration came about through Berlin Atonal. The performance was planned through Laurence who runs the festival and a mutual friend, James [Ginzburg] from Emptyset, I guess it was kind of like matchmaking. It was very easy from a sound and image point of view to find a mutual language between us. We realised, if he’s working with lights and I’m working with pressure waves, then we can talk about how the whole thing can be structured based on the various levels of energy, and then that turned into various concepts about entropy, life, and the universe… all the stuff everyone loves to talk about late at night. Now you see how it’s ended up as this huge timeline of energy across the whole universe. It seemed like a good enough idea to work with.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you arrive at this area of interest?</strong></p>\n<p>I got into a timeline of topics and placing them in a timeline of things; starting with the Big Bang (or the creation of life as we know it) and then life after us. The moment you have these ideas and you try and spread them out into a narrative, or timeline, you realise you’ve got all these spaces in between to fill out. Have you seen the film <em>Tree Of Life</em>? It describes the beginning of time and the end of time, and what ended up becoming the movie was just this little chunk in between. After reading the script of this film I started to get into the idea of fictional narratives, almost like religious myths, and that became the framework for the project. This kind of quasi religious mythology that speculated about the future and speculated about the past, and using sound and images to play around with that and experiment. That sounds so convoluted (laughs).</p>\n<p><strong>It’s interesting you bring up religion because you’ve used the image of the JET (Joint European Torus) for the physical release which you have likened to a church organ.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, so, apart from the fact it looks like a church organ, the JET is also one of the most technologically advanced machines that we’ve built. In fact, the church organ at one time was the most advanced, so there’s that parallel there. What they are doing there in terms of fusion reaction also became this interesting speculation about energy and the future and so there’s this project with this incredibly complicated machine that’s somehow trying to save the world by creating an infinite energy source. The whole thing just became really mythical. I don’t want to be pessimistic but there’s something really romantic about the project. But to call it romantic is almost dismissive or insulting. It’s something mythological, to recreate the sun, try and save the earth and solve all the world’s problems.</p>\n<p><strong>It seems a bit too big to comprehend, but then some of your topics have been quite expansive too, right?</strong></p>\n<p>So much stuff in our everyday lives are connected to these things though. It seems to me that these big ideas arrive even with small everyday things. On some level everyone’s had people pass away in their life, and when I’ve had moments like that, what I’ve thought about is life as something which resists death. I was having a conversation with someone I was close to, who was diagnosed with cancer, and we were talking about death and his fear of it, and he was kind of like, 'even an ant will try and not die...' I mean, an ant doesn’t even know it’s alive, but it will avoid death. No matter what your philosophical position or ideas are, we just want to stay here, and something about that context and that conversation just simplified things for me. We just don’t want to die, we fight death, on some very primal level. And everything seems to do that, from a little plant trying to grab some sunlight to a fighting human.</p>\n<p>Seeing someone fight through a terminal illness is a really remarkable thing, and also just an everyday, normal thing that a lot of people go through. So thinking about it is not a big idea, but it can lead to asking why life exists. So then, thinking of nuclear fusion just seems like the most crazy version of that: let’s now recreate the energy of the sun to keep the entire world alive. It seems like we’re just fighting death, trying to hold on to something. Sometimes these conversations begin as a search for answers when religious ideas don’t seem to provide any. If you can’t find comfort in religion, or dogmatic traditions, sometimes it can be more comforting to think about things outside of that; science, philosophy.</p>\n<p><strong>Is it comforting for you?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, because at times the music is literally just about not dying, as an emotion or a force, to just holding on to something. Have you seen <em>The Elephant Man</em>? At the end of it, the dream that Merrick has of his mum, and his mum is reciting a poem, I think from Tennyson. It’s a really sad moment where he knows that if he puts his pillows a certain way he won’t be able to breath right, so it’s this weird suicide moment, and he has this dream of his mum saying that the rivers never stop flowing, and the wind doesn’t stop, and that life continues on, nothing ever dies.... So that became a sentiment as well, that nothing ever dies. This person I mentioned before, we kind of talked about that moment of the film where nothing ever dies, but then it becomes very real, not scientific. You are talking to someone who is about to die, and you are trying to come to terms with this. Somehow all the stuff that comes to the fore is this direct emotional stuff, and then music seems to come out of those experiences.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://c4.staticflickr.com/6/5753/31343785195_d6b3cf70f4_b.jpg\" alt=\"paul\"></p>\n<p><strong>Would you say you’re religious?</strong></p>\n<p>I’ve never been religious but I grew up in a religious family. My mother was pretty Catholic in her approach to the world, so I grew up around it and it became a constant discussion. I think I was more argumentative with religion, always questioning it; can it actually answer all the problems that we are talking about? It’s a very small take on the universe in the sense that we see it nowadays, so I’ve never been religious, but I’ve always been in a conversation with it, even if it’s just antagonistic.</p>\n<p><strong>I find that there are a lot of parallels between religion and science, in the way they offer answers and, to a large extent, we just submit our faith to them without always fully understanding them or reasoning with them.</strong></p>\n<p>Exactly, you don’t always understand the science behind everything. So, for me, it’s almost like a religion itself. Scientists could be the priests of our day: we know about subconsciousness, we’ve got A.I., we figured out how we came to be… but it’s an origin myth. Some guys have worked out the universe is 13.8 billion years old, there was a big bang, and, well yeah, that works. But then the origin myth in certain monotheistic religions explain lots of moral problems about life and death. So then the question becomes: Do these scientific origin myths provide us with a framework for understanding our own existence?</p>\n<p>In a way, a lot of them become very nihilistic, they don’t really care about the human. You’re alive. You’re not alive. That’s it: blood stops flowing, there’s no electricity flowing through your brain. It leaves you with a sort of emptiness. If we disproved all the world’s religions and science was left, we’d have this sort of emptiness, or I would anyway. Some would find it very poetic, but a lot of people would find something missing; a mystery that would need answering. I find it really confusing thinking about why life tries not to die.</p>\n<p><strong>Does music help you explore these questions?</strong></p>\n<p>In a way music is a very good way of going through this stuff, putting it down and working through it. There are a few moments in <em>Continuum</em> that are literally just about the sentiment of not dying, of speaking to an imaginary person and telling them to not die, to keep going on. It sounds super cheesy, but it’s weirdly… have you read Schrödinger’s essay ‘What Is Life?’ He’s like, yeah, it resists entropy, and that’s it. You’ve got this weird poetic sentiment mixed in with pure physics.</p>\n<p><strong>Reading about your work, and what comes out of Subtext, there seems to be a recurrent theme of it being labelled ‘de-constructive,’ do you agree with that?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, I guess in a way that’s because we’re part of a longer, broader tradition of investigating what sound can do in a post-recorded sound world. So, at the beginning of the 20th Century we had all this technology which allowed us to divorce sound from its context. The potential for recorded music is to create new contexts. In a way that’s what electronic music does at its most fundamental level. There can be some really great new ideas that you love, and are excited by, but you still can’t help but cry when you hear certain other musics. Roly [Porter] and I have this ongoing conversation about Gorecki’s third symphony: it’s the ultimate, there’s nothing else to do now, what’s the point of electronics once you’ve got that? So that becomes that main problem that we’re dealing with. We’ve got this new technology but the only music that seems to make life make sense is this other stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you ever find you’re limited by the location that people experience your music?</strong></p>\n<p>It was frustrating years ago, but not so much now. I think in the early days we were all dealing with the problem of experimental club music because it wasn’t really about dancing, yet you still had to make and sell records. I put out a record on Tectonic and you couldn’t dance to it, but it was on a label which became a dance label. That was a problem then, but it’s not anymore because of institutions like TodaysArt and certain kinds of art. I imagine there are certain audiences that haven’t heard techno, house, and so they get to re-live that experience of dance music, but, similarly, I think there are people who have been through all that, and now can’t understand the logic of making a 6-minute dance record outside of its functional, economic aspect.</p>\n<p>I feel tremendously lucky because a lot of people involved in this sort of music don’t get the platform to present it. I teach a course called Creative Music Technology in Bath, which is essentially an electronic music course, and that’s one of the main thing that seems to come up. All the students have great ideas - some phenomenal ideas - but they have to deal with the economy that they’re in. Getting DJ bookings, filling a room with people who will pay a certain amount to get in, drink a certain amount through the night. I mean, I don’t want to be too anti or economical about it, but they deal with a certain kind of problem. It would be great if there were more financially viable options for people who are musicians, people who want to work with ideas. I find it interesting to be around younger people and seeing what they are dealing with, without being too cynical, jaded, or too idealistic.</p>\n<p><strong>Has your shift outside of dance music ever felt in conflict with the spaces you’re asked to perform in?</strong></p>\n<p>Before our performance me and Tarik were like, should we ask people to sit, if we ask them not to sit, they might get uncomfortable, they might leave. This was actually the first standing gig we did since Atonal, and we realised like, oh damn. I mean Atonal is so spread out and people just lie around everywhere, so this was quite an interesting thing to see that the room was full until the end, and it was also the end of the day! It was like 10pm. That felt like a win at the end of it, it’s very different in a cinema setting. It’s weird because in a DJ setting 45 minutes isn’t a long time, but in <em>Continuum</em> it feels really long sometimes. You’re saying, look, this only makes sense if you’ve been here for this part.</p>\n<p><strong>I asked partly because last night a girl left saying she didn’t want to stand for this “ambient/noise” set, and I remember at Sonic Acts when I saw you first, I was sitting down.</strong></p>\n<p>Ha! At what point? Was it the slow chords?</p>\n<p><strong>Yeah.</strong></p>\n<p>Yep, that’s definitely where we lose people. It makes sense in the context, but it’s difficult to ask people to sit through it, let alone stand. When people are sitting down they commit in a different way, they say, look, I can’t get up, I’m just going to go with it. But when they’re standing, I tell Tarik that people will just walk out. If it’s a long festival, people have been standing up for ten hours, there’s a bar outside, we won’t be able to keep them. I do prefer the sitting down version. People just relax, the whole kind of suspension of disbelief. They’re in their own space.</p>\n<p>Paul Jebanasam and Tarik Barri perform Continuum next at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/709988942482062/713854462095510/?notif_t=admin_plan_mall_activity%C2%ACif_id=1479806825503782\"><em>Fiber x Rest Is Noise, January 6th in Amsterdam</em></a></p>\n",

    "content": "<p>In thinking about my own obsession with sound, nothing resonates with me more than Pauline Oliveros’ offering in Dissolving your Ear Plugs (2016): ‘Take some time—no matter where you are—sit down and close your eyes for a while and just listen - When you open your eyes consider what you heard as the “music”. Later try to remember what you heard and express it with your instrument or voice.’</p>\n<p>‘Do this practice often until you begin to hear the world as music.’</p>\n<p>As a producer, I think we especially must listen intently to sounds often dismissed as ‘non-musical’. City noise makes beautiful backdrop in an otherwise meticulously structured track; human brains can pick up rhythms and melodies in apparently unorganised clamour of sound. I don’t believe the joy through attentive listening should be limited to producers or composers, either. While her reputation as an innovator is very much deserved -- her seminal album Deep Listening, recorded in an enormous cistern with 45 seconds reverb time, developed into an ensemble, an institute, and a philosophy central to her life’s work -- I’ve never felt her music was alienating or exclusive. Oliveros’ hope in our human capacity to sympathise with one another and appreciate creativity shines through her oeuvre. Out of her comprehensive catalogue, I’ve chosen three of my favourite pieces.</p>\n<p><strong>BYE BYE BUTTERFLY</strong></p>\n<p>Recorded at the San Francisco Tape Center, of which Oliveros was a founding member, Bye Bye Butterfly (1965) is a manifestation of her deep passion for sound and technology, striking in its disruption of outdated narratives. High-pitched oscillators freely move through the whole piece, sporadically punctuated by the deliberate placement of tape machine pop, inviting the audience to listen to the sparse -- and surprisingly organic -- purity of her electronic sound world. Suddenly, an excerpt of Madame Butterfly rings through, dapped in delay and reverb; the sample and oscillators take turns inhabiting centre stage, fluctuating in melody and volume. Madame Butterfly's glorified apologism of orientalist misogyny is ousted from its canonical status, broken into a dissonant, unsettling fragment within Oliveros' immersive space. Eventually, we are fully returned to the oscillators, but this time with darker, richer effects, the pulse of the tape machine carrying us forward. This piece established Oliveros as not only a composer and accordionist but a pioneer of sonic technology, a brilliant mind who made us hear our musical future and organic selves in the world of computerised sound.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/14264050&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>TO VALERIE SOLANAS AND MARILYN MONROE IN RECOGNITION OF THEIR DESPERATION</strong></p>\n<p>It's hard to overstate the significance of feminism in Oliveros' work. An out lesbian despite the intensely homophobic and misogynistic climate of mid-late 20th century, she actively invoked women's solidarity throughout her life. To Valerie Solanas and Marilyn Monroe in Recognition of Their Desperation (1970), written in the aftermath of Monroe's suicide and Solanas' SCUM Manifesto and failed murder attempt of Andy Warhol, Oliveros brings together the same suffering of two seemingly very different women: Monroe was famous and subject to immense male attention, whereas Solanas was destitute, mocked, then forgotten; Monroe assimilated into the gender role imposed on her, whereas Solanas vehemently rejected it. Yet their fates remained the same: a woman whose artistic and intellectual potential were stripped at the hands of men, and Oliveros dedicated this piece to their pain. The piece invites the members of ensemble to select and sustain five pitches throughout the performance, while remaining cautious to not overpower others; if an element becomes dominant, others are instructed to raise their volume until equality is achieved. In effect, Oliveros wanted to forge a non-hierarchal collection of sound, every element feeding one another. The size and instrumentation can greatly vary -- from a 14-piece ensemble at its 1970 premier at Hope College, to the 1977 Wesleyan University recording by a 43-piece orchestra -- but every performance is unfailingly haunting, fortified by the performers' ceaseless cycle of giving and receiving.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/111269893&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>TUNING MEDITATION</strong></p>\n<p>‘Tuning Meditation’ is another set of thoughtful, simple instructions for a vocal performance. The participants begin by listening to their surroundings; they inhale deeply, then begin exhaling at a note of their choice, eventually choosing a pitch of another and joining in. At the next exhale, they sing a pitch no one else is singing. These two steps are repeated for a duration of anywhere from three minutes to twenty; the piece has been performed at concerts, museums, classrooms, symposiums, often with the onlookers being encouraged to join in themselves. The resulting sound is organic, alive: pitches congregate then fall away from each other, again and again, full of intent. The unconstrained yet unifying nature of this piece, perhaps, is the best way to enter Oliveros’ world, where boundaries between ‘musician’ and ‘non-musician’ are blurred. Though the music world was eager to glorify her as as an experimental pioneer, Oliveros repeatedly reminded us: music is for everyone.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/34795408\" width=\"100%\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>It's fair to say the work of Fluxion, aka Kostas Soublis, has had a fairly large impact on my thinking about electronic music. I first encountered the Greek artist through his <em>Vibrant Forms</em> LP a few years ago, around the time it was reissued on Type. Before the U.S. based label saw fit to reissue the LP, copies of the assorted 12&quot;s that make up the Chain Reactions original would have been considered Discogs gold-dust.</p>\n<p>Considering how uncharted the release felt to me just a few years ago, it's difficult to comprehend it's impact back in the late '90s when it was first released. These days at least, it is considered a milestone of the dub-techno genre. Furthermore, Soublis followed up with <em>Vibrant Forms II</em> just a few years later. Despite the demise of Chain Reaction in the early 2000s, he has maintained a steady string of 12&quot;s and LPs over the years, setting up his own label 'Vibrant Music' for a spell and becoming a regular on Kenneth Christiansen's Echocord.</p>\n<p>Recently things have come full circle however, with the release of <em>Vibrant Forms III</em>. Soublis has previously noted this marks &quot;the last chapter of [the] trilogy&quot;, so we felt it would be a fitting time to catch up with him. As well as discussing the new album, we talked Ennio Morricone, Philip Glass and the influence of politics on electronic music in Greece.</p>\n<p><strong>Vibrant Forms III was recently released. Did the creative process differ from the first and second editions?</strong></p>\n<p>It hasn't really changed. I was in the same frame of mind when I recorded <em>Vibrant Forms III</em>. The concept of all those releases, was about creative process - where this can lead to. How open can I be, while being strict at the same time? How can an incident give birth to a whole new perspective, one that you may want to dedicate a whole piece to? Due to the fact that the music is quite improvisational, the sense of adventure was really strong on those recordings.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/117607062&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong><em>Vibrant Forms</em> I &amp; II were reissued in the last few years on Type and Subwax respectively. Did the reissuing have an influence on you releasing this final version? How did Type first approach the subject of putting the original Vibrant Forms out again?</strong></p>\n<p>When I was first contacted by Type, I was really positive. I wanted listeners to have the opportunity to hear a remastered version after 15 years or so. As far as I know the Chain Reaction back catalogue was unavailable for many years. So when Type offered to re-issue it and I was very happy with the idea.</p>\n<p>With Subwax it was the same - they were interested, and we decided to have it re-issued. While I was discussing it with Jimi [Subwax's co-owner], I let him know that I had another <em>Vibrant Forms</em> album I wanted to release. He was really enthusiastic, and offered to release it. With all the <em>Vibrant Forms</em> releases from Type and Subwax, I was really fortunate to work with people that allow me to decide on various aspects of the process.</p>\n<p><strong>What was your first contact with Chain Reaction in the late '90s? Did they approach you or were you submitting demo tapes?</strong></p>\n<p>I first heard Chain Reactions and Basic Channel in 1995 or so, while studying in the UK. I can’t say I prefer one release over the others. If you try to mix all those records together, you have some various pages or chapters that form a story - one of those stories that no-one can quite describe it’s ingredients. I think I bought the whole catalogue. I really liked the organic aspect of the productions, and the faceless approach. I was making some ambient excursions (long improvisational mixes) at the time.</p>\n<p>I was traveling and staying in Berlin often between 1995-1998, and on one of my visits I went to Hardwax. I asked the guys in there to pass my demo to the owners. It worked, and when they got in touch, we started working on those releases. It was a nice period working with them on the Chain Reaction releases. I was able to be there for all the mastering and editing sessions. I haven't seen Mark or Moritz in ages, but I follow their works with interest.</p>\n<p>![a] (http://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1627/24550250721_77f6efc842_h.jpg)</p>\n<p><em>Fluxion live at Mutek, 2014.</em></p>\n<p><strong>What was it you were studying in the UK and how long were you over here? Did it have an impact on the music you make?</strong></p>\n<p>I did an art course which focused on photography and film, and then another one in music technology. I stayed in London for three years. It most definitely played a part in my development as a musician. It was a very strong period musically and a lot of things were happening in the UK music scene, but also in Berlin and the U.S. I was trying to shape something up - it was at a very primal stage of what it was going to be <em>Vibrant Forms</em>.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/143495223&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Athens seems to have quite a healthy electronic music scene these days but I wanted to ask about your early experiences. What was it like when you were growing up though? Was there much of a clubbing/gigging scene for example?</strong></p>\n<p>When I started releasing music we must have had only ten people making electronic music in Greece. A close friend from that era I still see often is Savvas Ysatis. He has an amazing sense of humor. I'm sure he's uncertain of the number of projects and releases he has produced as there's been so many. We always have interesting discussions about music. With small exceptions, the <em>live</em> electronic music scene of the '90s was non-existent. There were some good DJ's though.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of options now. This turbulence caused by the Greek crisis (which is not only a financial one, but an existential one as far as I am concerned), has made a lot of people cut to the chase - looking for substance that matters. It's like this situation has matured a generation of musicians faster than normal. I consider this an upside of the pressure people feel.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you think of any examples of overtly political electronic music coming out of Greece at the moment?</strong></p>\n<p>Not really, but I see a lot more underground acts. It feels like people’s interests have shifted a bit. I see younger people needing to feel more alive in their music and art nowadays. You have a generation who feels numb. They are facing a very uncertain future and need to have their voices heard. Voices that don’t have 'parental guidance' as they have every right to feel that all the previous political &amp; economic models have produced negative results. So to me it feels that in times of turbulence, one starts to question more. This can lead to creativity.</p>\n<p><strong>In another interview you mentioned an interest in film scores - is this a field you have ever tried working in? Tell us a bit about some of your favourite soundtracks, and why you think they work so effectively.</strong></p>\n<p>I have worked in advertising for many years, producing music and sound design. I’ve never worked on a feature film, although I would love to try it out. I like film scores because when they don’t fall into clichés, it can be very interesting. It doesn’t always have a set form, as the music follows a story, or creates a sub-story. So when you hear it outside its natural environment - without watching the film - it can feel very unpredictable. Emotions change more rapidly, like in real life. The pieces don’t aim for the functionality that the music industry requires from a release, so one can say that it’s free of certain burdens as a listening experience outside the cinema.</p>\n<p>I grew up with Morricone soundtracks. Nearly everything that this composer touched was incredible, but favourites were the Sergio Leone movies for the rawness and The Thing soundtrack for being so cold, suspended and otherworldly. I love Maurice Jarre's Jacob’s Ladder soundtrack. It has this decaying motion, a feeling of falling. Philip Glass' <em>Koyaanisqatsi</em> was an introduction to how repetitive motifs and film work together. Those had a long lasting impact, but there are many others.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/112469437&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I was lucky enough to see you play at Culture Box in Copenhagen for an Echocord showcase a few years ago with Kenneth Christiansen. Is gigging something you enjoy? Do you feel restricted ever using a much more condensed version of your home studio?</strong></p>\n<p>Performing live is an essential aspect of what I do. It’s a two way connection I need to have with my audience, and something that leads to new ideas that I bring back to the studio.</p>\n<p>I think this is always an issue, but it’s down to what you need to do on stage. If you need to bring a whole modular cabinet because it’s essential to the performance, then you should. If not, I don’t see the point. On my upcoming <em>Vibrant Forms</em> audio-visual performance, I will use a lot more analogue equipment from my studio, as it is essential to bring this gear along to be able to reproduce the sounds from the albums.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us a bit more about the audiovisual show - do you have a visual artist joining you on stage? Who did you work on it with?</strong></p>\n<p>The 'Vibrant Forms - Live' performance is a study on impression. It reflects amorphous shapes and worlds that are constantly evolving and do not have a static, fixed definition, allowing the audience to engage freely.</p>\n<p>I collaborated with the photographer/cinematographer Lucas Zimmermann. After researching visual forms and impressions, he came up with the idea of creating unidentifiable forms and shapes. Shapes that change and transform into others, in an organic non-artificial way.</p>\n<p>It’s sound and images interacting in a unique space we created for them... In such an environment, nothing is absolute.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/264888186&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>2016 has unanimously been agreed to have been a bit of a stinker (at least by all the right people, the Nigels might beg to differ) with further unpleasantries around the corner. Given this it seems trite to give a rundown of all that has blighted this year and argue that solace can be found in music and musical communities. Of course music can provide an escape from the horrors of the times, but it ought to challenge them and visualise an alternative too.</p>\n<p>Anyway, there are reasons to be cheerful. Two nefarious organisations that really stunk things up last year (both covered obsessively by Vice magazine) have had the wind taken out of their sails somewhat. PC Music and ISIS are both waning in influence. Meanwhile, although the consensus in clubland still seems to be that lo-fi house and Dixon are where the party is at — they really, really are not — there are encouraging signs that it’s once again becoming a bit less stale. So join us in examining the last 12 months of electronic music, and in 2017, remember to say it loud: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWs1-2foKoo\">we don’t need this fascist groove thang</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Autechre @ Concorde 2</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://c8.staticflickr.com/1/582/30890668543_989e6398aa_z.jpg\" alt=\"a\"></p>\n<p>I probably shouldn’t write about Autechre every year. Although more than likely I will anyway. This year at Brighton’s Concorde 2, the duo did what they do best, defying any expectations I'd built up previously. Following Russell Haswell's clusterfuck of modular bravado, their performance felt a picture of serenity. Conjuring washing FM Synthesis, icy, digital abstractions and twitching granular melodies, Autechre’s set was nothing short of mesmeric.  Of particular note was the sharp cut to baroque church organs: something which left me unsure whether to laugh, cry or go and baptise myself in the gents urinal.</p>\n<p><em>Theo Darton-Moore</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Micachu &amp; Tirzah, <em>Taz and May Vids</em></strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://c5.staticflickr.com/1/778/30858939084_c032714b84_b.jpg\" alt=\"b\"></p>\n<p>This year, Micachu returned from scoring Pablo Larrain's Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis biopic, <em>Jackie</em>, to release more of her back-to-basics bedroom oddities. It's a little cheeky to be including this in a list of 2016: the lead single, ‘GO’, has been floating around the internet for over 5 years. But this EP comes as a cohesive whole, with a start, middle and a fidgety remix from Demdike Stare to end. Mica’s instrumentals are as claustrophobic and mangled as one should now expect. The pitches warble about like a damaged cassette, and everything is drenched in chorus. There are also vocal performances from Tirzah, who is herself something of a curiosity. There is only smattering of online material one can find under her name, yet the buzz around each has been deafening. This release in particular sold out faster than you can say ‘go’.</p>\n<p><em>George McVicar</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Jacob Kirkegaard’s Labyrinthitis Workshop</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://c6.staticflickr.com/1/564/30890669053_f2a3ccf7a1_b.jpg\" alt=\"c\"></p>\n<p>Lured by the promise that “attendees will have their ears recorded”, I went to Filthy Lucre’s Sounding Body workshop, where they were presenting Jacob Kirkegaard’s <em>Labyrinthitis</em>: an installation made by his “SOAE”. What now? “Your cochlea can produce pitches or tones, which are called Otoacoustic Emissions,” Kirkegaard explained, “and when they do so without any stimuli, they’re called Spontaneous OAE. So, as a result, your ears are making music without you telling it to.” To explore the musicality of our ears, Kirkegaard played us excerpts of Labyrinthitis; strikingly pure, firm tones started ringing... and I slowly realised that some were coming not from the speakers, but from inside my ears. I could tell which by turning my head slowly: the sounds from the speakers would feel closer or further according to the movement of my head, but my own OAE wouldn’t move at all, remaining totally central to my perception. It was jaw-dropping.</p>\n<p>“Those OAEs were induced by external stimuli, in response to what was coming from the loudspeakers,” Kirkegaard said, “but about 3/4ths of the population also have SOAE. Who wants to have their ears recorded?” My hand shot up. He inserted a tiny microphone into my ears, and I breathed as quietly as I could for a minute. Despite Kirkegaard’s initial doubts (“even if there is anything, it’s very quiet”), he wrote me excitedly the next day: “I edited the recording, and found you have six pitches in your right ear, and two in your left!” The human body is an instrument indeed.</p>\n<p><em>Rena Minegishi</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Sote</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://c7.staticflickr.com/6/5560/30858938814_40d41bcea2_b.jpg\" alt=\"d\"></p>\n<p>Having been first exposed to Ata Ebtekar aka Sote through the work he produced in the '90s, such as the bone-grinding 'Neuroenhancer' or crunching breakbeat of 'Subconscious', it takes some reflection to understand how he has arrived at the razor-edged, computerized sound he currently touts. To an outside ear, his <em>Hardcore Sounds of Tehran</em> cassette or ‘Hyper Urban 20 30’ EP might sound like complete chaos, the last throes of a dying laptop firing oddball glitches out at random. Closer listening however reveals Ebtekar's broadcasts rife with complex polyrhythms and intricate melodies, locking the listener in discordant, alien grooves.</p>\n<p>Considering his discography dates back a good 15-20 years, I’m slightly ashamed to have only discovered Ebtekar this year. Yet with the consistently inspiring material he has released across 2016, I won’t be taking my eye off the ball again.</p>\n<p><em>Theo Darton-Moore</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Norberg Festival</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://c3.staticflickr.com/1/750/30858939274_895d754596_b.jpg\" alt=\"e\"></p>\n<p>My experience going to Norberg as a volunteer began with an 11 hour coach journey from Copenhagen to the small Swedish town of Norberg. Almost everyone else on the coach had been working at the 100% volunteer run festival several years in a row, no small feat considering that this is at least a 7 day commitment. I soon found out why. With only minor exceptions, this was one of the most horizontal teams I’ve ever worked in, where all participants had the opportunity to use both their existing skills and learn new ones. This all took place amidst long northern nights, an endless Swedish forest, and Mimer: the decommissioned iron mine and processing plant that serves as the festival’s main venue. This is a structure unlike any other, and really has to be seen to be understood. Over the weekend Mimer played host to some of the best experimental acts around at the moment, alongside a variety of forward thinking club music at the Norberg’s other two stages, Kraftwerk and 303.</p>\n<p><em>Harry Murdoch</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Peder Mannerfelt @ Cafe OTO</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://c1.staticflickr.com/1/281/30858938944_8728fd1e1d_h.jpg\" alt=\"f\"></p>\n<p>Peder Mannerfelt has taken the idea ‘less is more’ to almost absurdist extremes recently. This year he has been an undeniably powerful force in electronic music, creating reductionist rave tracks which strip anything superfluous. It’s a brave approach, and one which takes real conviction to pull off. Earlier this year he performed at Cafe OTO to somniferous effect. It’s hard not to get lost in thought watching Mannerfelt gyrate back and forth in his long, flowing straw mask, listening to the boomeranging electronics. Computerized sounds zoom past as if circling a racetrack, synthetic vocal samples gently morphing alongside formidable modular experiments. His rippling technicolour visuals may have been somewhat lost in the gloom of Cafe OTO, but in the end, ogling Mannerfelt’s choice of footwear was enough. And I never need see a pair of crocodile brogues again.</p>\n<p><em>Izzi Pettis &amp; Theo Darton-Moore</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Beatrice Dillon, 'Can I Change My Mind'</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://c6.staticflickr.com/1/331/30890670813_ae821555de_h.jpg\" alt=\"g\"></p>\n<p>Within the first few minutes of ‘Can I Change My Mind’, Beatrice Dillon begins to answer her own question. Though initially set within deep grooves and pattern development, Dillon does not hold steadfast to traditional structure for long. The transitions stutter and halt. The track flickers from place to place, inserting rhythmic flourishes within the spaces in-between. She draws from a myriad of rhythmic, percussive and instrumental influences. It’s like a piece of improvised reggae: let’s go here, let’s go there and who cares how you get there.</p>\n<p><em>Helen Savage</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>SIREN Warehouse Party</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://c2.staticflickr.com/1/504/30890669273_fece247155_b.jpg\" alt=\"h\"></p>\n<p>A warehouse in Haringey, a sound system, a consortium of women spinning techno to a crowd of gender-variant twenty-somethings. In a climate that seems increasingly hostile to underground venues, and in light of recent discussions about women in electronic music and of harassment in clubs, I’m acutely aware that what I’m looking at might offer a glimpse of the future of London’s underground music scene: makeshift, a little bit less than legal, and increasingly female.</p>\n<p>It’s a trend that seems to have resonated across borders, with nights from female:pressure in Berlin or Apeiron in Copenhagen attracting similar turnouts—a testament to the demand for inclusive events—and one I’m happy to see. I’ll leave it the organisers of Butlins festivals to contemplate the irony of their quasi-anti-establishment <a href=\"http://www.factmag.com/2016/03/18/bloc-founder-quits-raves-hipsters-dance-music-safe-boring\">rants against safe-spaces</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Amatia Lily</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>group A @ CTM</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://c3.staticflickr.com/1/707/30858939714_29f41ba07f_h.jpg\" alt=\"i\"></p>\n<p>In the sweaty main room of the renowned Berghain, group A out-poured to stunned on-lookers. Typically home to cold, hyper-engineered techno, the duo re-appropriated the venue for their own devices. group A eliminated the monotonous kicks and brooding bass synths in favour of metallic spring delays, screeching violas and deafening screams. 2016 marked for the band a meteoric rise in the wake of their brilliant <em>70 + a =</em> LP the year before. During this tour, it became clear that the music of group A is in some sense uncontainable. Not even the steely walls of Berghain could constrict them.</p>\n<p><em>George McVicar</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>The Fall and Rise of Fabric, 1999-2016</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://c2.staticflickr.com/1/725/30890670233_e09374e9ed_b.jpg\" alt=\"j\"></p>\n<p>When Fabric opened in 1999, UK nightlife had already begun its transition from free parties and raves to a more normalized entertainment industry. In 2016, Fabric was forced to shut its doors because its licence was repealed following drug related deaths on the premises. Thus, the model of the mega club had shown its limits. Following the council’s decision, the club owners and a series of personalities in the now powerful industry set up a campaign to “save our culture” and reopen the club. Eventually, the campaign was proved successful and Fabric’s licence was granted.  The conditions of reopening enforced by the council choked me at first, but also appeared in clear continuation of hyper-regulation and conservative values plaguing modern clubs.</p>\n<p>In particular, Fabric will now permit undercover police officers to roam the dancefloor to monitor drug use. This mirrors the UK Government’s own history of strict and irresponsible zero-tolerance drug legislation; one that refuses to work with information and prevention. Fabric have permitted committed members of an institution that has historically harassed and beaten minorities on the dance floor, encouraging club owners to criminalise their own users for the sake of saving a so-called “culture”. But what or whose culture has been saved? The one born out of social groups and minorities targeted and harassed by the police, or the one born out of the industrial financialisation of every existing form of art and leisure? Fabric has transformed the party into a hybrid of big capital and bigoted authoritarian politics. It is also likely to be but the first domino to fall: We can now expect to see more clubs to close across the country, only to rise again under similar legislation. 2016 brought us a club full of cops. Merry Christmas.</p>\n<p><em>Hortense Maignien</em></p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Iranian artist Ata Ebtekar, aka Sote has had quite a year. In June, Opal Tapes hosted his <em>Hardcore Sounds from Tehran</em> LP, providing a snapshot of his incendiary, hyper-digitized live shows. Around the same time, Shapednoise fronted label Repitch released a 10&quot; featuring two breakneck hardcore tracks, which have been hibernating on Ebtekar's DAT tapes since the 1990s. Recently, he also released 'Hyper Urban 20 30', a Ge-stell released EP dedicated to the Iranian musicians he has encountered working on SET Festival in his home city, Tehran.</p>\n<p>SET began two years ago when Ebtekar relocated back to Iran from the U.S, providing an outlet for Iranian electronic musicians to perform their work live, simultaneously encouraging more people to become engaged with the scene. SET has subsequently gained international attention and the annual festival is also subsidised with one off events across the year.</p>\n<p>If the aforementioned releases alongside co-running his own festival weren't enough, Ebtekar has also performed numerous live shows around the world including Berghain, Cafe OTO and Unsound Festival, where we were lucky enough to catch him a few months ago.</p>\n<p>With the year drawing to a close, we decided to reflect on a busy 12 months with Ebtekar, discussing electronic music in Tehran, Autechre copycats and growing up with Duran Duran.</p>\n<p><strong>Your set at Unsound reminded me of the 'Hyper-urban 20 30' material. How do you go about putting your live sets together? Are they fairly improvisational or do you aim to recreate tracks from your records?</strong></p>\n<p>Over the years I've done it all. I've done sets which are totally improvised, but in the past couple of years, they are definitely more planned. For Unsound I wanted something between my two releases; the 'Hyper-urban 20 30' EP and <em>Hardcore Sounds from Tehran</em>. I prepare lots of loops and clips and do lots of triggering and processing live. Nothing too fancy!</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/264555710&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>It reminded me of the few times I've been lucky enough to see Autechre - this very granular, digitized sound. It's hard to separate the different tracks, it all fits together very cohesively.</strong></p>\n<p>I love Autechre, they're wonderful. In my opinion they're probably the best electronic composers out there. I consider them true, serious composers, not just producers. Sonically, what I try to do and what has always moved me is very, very electronic sounds, but no matter how harsh or intense they are, them being clean is very important. No matter how distorted I go I still need that shine in there. I usually get that comment from the sound engineers at live shows. I ask them &quot;how did the sound seem in front of the house?&quot; When they tell me it sounds very clean, that's when it's mission accomplished.</p>\n<p><strong>I think it's a really easy trap to fall into - just trying to be as loud and obnoxious as possible - noise for noise's sake.</strong></p>\n<p>With the last few albums and EPs, 'Hyper Urban 20 30', <em>Hardcore Sounds from Tehran</em>, <em>Arrythmia</em> and <em>Architectonic</em>, the main influences have been techno and noise music really. At the same time, none of the current noise music moves me. When I used to like it, it was more experimental and more freeform. Now it all seems formulated.</p>\n<p>Just like you said - noise just for the sake of noise - that doesn't work for me. It's always been part of my aesthetic; it has to be a structured musical composition no matter how noisey you get. I still have a long way to go, but I think I'm being semi-successful at reaching this goal. When people who are not into electronic music listen to my music and say &quot;this is just pure noise, nonsense&quot;, it's OK. But if you know, if you spend some time and listen to the music then you'll know there's a lot of harmonies and melodies and poly-rhythmic structures that are very calculated.</p>\n<p>That's why I think Autechre are amazing. There are a lot of Autechre clones out there - they think its just about the glitches or the type of beats they use but its not. Those are just techniques. Being a composer behind the sound is the most important factor I think.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/257995612&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Going back to 'Hyper Urban 20 30' - it's dedicated to young Iranian musicians right?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah I'm talking about people in their 20s and 30s in Tehran. When I moved back to Tehran I got to know a bunch of younger artists from the scene and we became friends, and kind of colleagues when we started SET Festival two years ago. There's ten of us, mostly experimental electronic musicians but also some visual artists. The whole idea was to provide a platform not only for ourselves but for other electronic musicians in Iran, as well as opening a dialogue with other countries.</p>\n<p>I was so moved by those people because they are so talented. In terms of learning all the coding and sound arts software, they are all self taught because you can't learn about those things in a school or university here.  These people find everything on the internet; software, PDFs of books,  or they tell their friends or family members when they go outside Iran to get them the books they need...</p>\n<p>When I first came back, one of the guys, Siavash Amini - he noticed I had all these books from the U.S about synthesis and sound. Very specialised books that you can't even find in bookstores in the West. He was like &quot;I have read this&quot;, or &quot;I have the PDF of this one&quot;. I was just blown away.</p>\n<p><strong>It must take so much motivation to overcome those obstacles.</strong></p>\n<p>Exactly, they're amazing. They're not just doing it because it seems like a cool thing at the time or a phase they're going through. They're really passionate and serious about it. They're doing it from the roots up and I honestly think that in a few years Tehran is going to be a hub for experimental electronic music. I was moved by them and the energy I feel living here, so I wanted to dedicate that EP to them.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/486/31454229201_55f5be5e2e_b.jpg\" alt=\"e\"></p>\n<p><em>An SET event with SaffronKeira and Siavash Amini in May, 2016</em></p>\n<p><strong>Talking about SET - what are the biggest obstacles in Tehran in terms of running an event like that?</strong></p>\n<p>From the beginning we set rules and goals for ourselves. One of the most important things was to remain absolutely independent. We didn’t want any outside forces telling us what to do artistically, so one of our biggest problems is the financial thing. We either have to pay from our own pockets, or we have to find a sponsor who’s willing to just give us the funding without wanting to butt in on the artistic side of things.</p>\n<p>I would say the main obstacle has been finding venues who will give us the venue for five days in a row to do an annual event. We had to find a solution this year because the venues were asking for huge amounts of money for a week lockout of the venue. We decided to do a four weekend in a row type of event instead. In two or three weeks we’re going to have two artists perform on a Sunday, then the week after that again, and so on.</p>\n<p>I think it’s going to be interesting. A lot of our audience are in their 20s so it would be hard for them to attend five days in a row anyway. This way they can have a week off to rest and maybe come to all the events. We’ve never wanted to do anything underground - without a permit or anything like that - it’s important to us that we reach a wider audience and bring people into our scene.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/204110210&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>How do you consume your music? Are there record stores in Tehran you can find recent releases in or do you get your music online?</strong></p>\n<p>In terms of vinyl there are individuals who sell records privately. There is a Friday Bazaar with some people who sell vinyl, but there’s not a huge market. There are CD stores but they mainly sell classical and traditional music… It’s pretty limited. Most music is from downloading really. Myself I don’t download anything, but you should see these people’s hardrives - it’s unbelievable!</p>\n<p>I have an American bank account but I can’t really do anything with it here. If I login to my account from Iran, in the U.S they’re going to immediately freeze it because that’s how the big boys play their games. It happened to my nephew, he bought a 99 cent song on iTunes a few years ago and they froze his account in the U.S. It took him months to sort it out - it was just one song!</p>\n<p><strong>What's the perception of something like SET in Tehran generally? Is it seen as something very outsider?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s a small festival so most people obviously don’t know about it, but slowly word is getting out there. The cool thing about all the performances we have done so far is the fact that we <em>do</em> bring people into these events who aren’t from the scene. They’re usually very positive about it and the even more beautiful thing is that they come back for other events.</p>\n<p>That combination of the country being closed for a couple of decades after the revolution… It wasn’t totally closed but because of the Iraq/Iran War for eight years after the revolution - Iranian society went through a lot trauma. Two or three decades worth. I don’t know if it’s just from that - people were deprived of a lot of different types of music.</p>\n<p>I personally think it’s a combination of that and the fact Iranians in general are big art lovers. Poetry for example, no matter what type of background you have, no matter whether you’re illiterate or you have a PhD, poetry is a part of your life from when your born to when you die. People recite poetry when they’re having a conversation. It’s that infused in regular life.</p>\n<p>The feedback has been very positive and I think it’s not only SET, there’s other outlets for new music. A lot of these things are happening because there are positive reactions.</p>\n<p><strong>You mentioned your nephew Ala earlier. You collaborated together in San Francisco right?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah we did an audiovisual installation type of thing. We did a couple of collaborations but that was a particularly good one actually. He’s a visual artist. He teaches at Stanford so he was taking care of the whole aesthetic side of things and I was taking care of the audio and sound.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/492/30760387423_a3f98e8c9a_z.jpg\" alt=\"w\"></p>\n<p><em>Ata performing with his nephew Ala in San Francisco, 2015.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Did your interest in electronic music develop during your time in the U.S or where you already making music before?</strong></p>\n<p>My interest really started in Iran when I was about nine years old. I was listening to Western pop music. My favourite group at the time was Duran Duran (laughs). I remember listening to their music and what I was always interested in was the kind of strange synthetic sounds.</p>\n<p>When I moved to Germany at the age of 11 I got into the whole synth pop thing. I started really getting into Depeche Mode - I still love Depeche Mode! Then I got really heavily into electronic body music – groups like Front 242.  I covered those bands in a high school band that I had in Germany, which transitioned into making our own electronic music. We left out the vocals and  made really intense electronic music.</p>\n<p>At 17 I moved to the San Francisco area and the whole techno explosion happened in Europe. I remember being in San Francisco at one point and listening to techno thinking “this this is so amazing, and this is so close to what we used to do in high school&quot;. Someone told me &quot;this is techno music&quot;. I was like &quot;oh my god we were doing this!&quot; So maybe if I’d stayed in San Francisco and not left Germany I would have been part of the whole thing...</p>\n<p><strong>…like Richie Hawtin or something?</strong></p>\n<p>(laughs) Yeah like the Persian Richie Hawtin or something. Eventually I studied Sound Art in the U.S and down the line I became a teacher and started teaching computer music and sound design for about seven years before I came back to Iran.</p>\n<p><strong>I have your Repitch 10” somewhere here… It was the first material of yours I heard that and it just sounds so different to the rest of your catalogue.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah I think that’s a good thing actually. I just played in Milan and they really wanted me to do a set of Repitch stuff. I had to tell them, I’m really, really over that. I’m really glad that the Repitch guys supported my work from 20 years ago and I’m really glad it came out. I’m proud of that work but to be honest with you I can’t get into that stuff anymore! It’s always been about progress for me. At the time unfortunately nobody wanted to listen to the stuff Repitch put out this year. It needed to be 20 years later to work.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/271065270&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>How did they get hold of those tracks?</strong></p>\n<p>The Repitch guys basically asked me whether I had material similar to the Warp release. I have a huge archive of music from over the years on DAT tapes. I kept sending them material and they picked those two for a 10”.</p>\n<p><strong>You mentioned you have a commission project for CTM, can you tell us a bit about that?</strong></p>\n<p>For the next couple of months that’s going to be my life basically. February 1 is the performance day. It’s an electroacoustic project - I’m working with  musicians here in Tehran. I’m recording them playing traditional Iranian instruments, and I’ll be doing my electronics. On stage there’s going to be someone playing the Santur, which is a Persian dulcimer and someone playing a Persian Setar.</p>\n<p>Hopefully in a few weeks we’ll get rehearsals going for the performance. There is going to be a visual element done by Tarik Barri who is a contemporary of Thom Yorke. He’s a great visual artist. In a few weeks I'm going to Berlin to practice with him, then I’m going to come back and rehearse with the musicians again. Several days before the performance all four of us will be under the same roof to prepare for the actual performance.</p>\n<p><em>Read more about Ebtekar's upcoming CTM performance <a href=\"http://www.ctm-festival.de/festival-2017/welcome/ctm-2017-1st-announcement/\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/227449508&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe> \n",

Since meeting 12 years ago, the duo have released two records together under <em>Raz Ohara's Odd Orchestra</em>. Raz Ohara himself is known foremost as an experimental folk singer, taking forays into the weird and wonderful world of neo-psychedelia. On <em>Y</em> though, though, Oliver Doerell, better known as Cummi Flu, steps into the foreground. Doerell works primarily as a multi-media instrumentalist, professing to &quot;prey on ancient feelings of estrangement, sanctuary and self-exploration&quot;. On this record, Ohara's voice was treated as &quot;an additional instrument, a colour&quot; for Doerell to play with. There is also the presence of self-built instruments, including &quot;rubber percussion&quot;, which features on every track.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/195441681?byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>The album makes for a head-scratching listen. From its very outset, the rhythms are wrong-footing; the melodies warbled and distorted. Almost every element, from melody to structure, have been bent out of discernible recognition. Ohara croons soulful song over reversed pan pipes, overdriven marimbas, accelerating tape loops. It's a record teeming with life and curiosity. In light of this new release, the pair have recorded a mixtape stockpiling some of the nebulous influences that informed it.

    "content": "<p>I recently watched the new Werner Herzog film, <em>Into the Inferno</em>. Across a multitude of landscapes, Herzog and Clive Oppenheimer explore the cultural traditions of communities living close to volcanoes. Expectedly they encounter fear and high levels of pressure in these groups, but also intense spirituality, and some cosmic reflections on our own place in the universe. Listening to <em>Diverted Units</em>, the latest release from Maria W Horn shortly after, I couldn't help but think there are some parallel themes at play.</p>\n<p>Take the formidable distortions of 'Unit I', or tectonic rumblings of 'Unit V'. Sounds like these conjure themes of destruction and apocalypse readily, yet other elements tell a different story. There is something transcendental in the ascending dial tones of 'Unit III', or the reflective ambience of closer 'Unit XXX'. 'Unit IV' makes a strong example, swaying this way and that between twinkling, discordant melodies and jackhammer blasts of noise and static.</p>\n<p>I have heard a fair amount of Horn's work previously. I was first introduced to her work through Stockholm Drone Society, a collective she has occupied for the past few years. Last year I was lucky enough to see her sharpened-electronica project TMRW at Norbergfestival, and have heard numerous releases from the label she runs out of Stockholm, XKatedral.  This latest work out via Holodisc felt different however; a notably important step forward.</p>\n<p>As I discussed in an interview with Sote a few weeks ago, noise and glitch music today often feels overly formulated, confined to structures which have worked previously. Horn's <em>Diverted Units</em> escapes falling into those traps - it feels freeform and original in a way that captures the energy of early Sähkö or Mille Plateaux records. There is a depth of expression that feels lacking with a lot of Horn's contemporaries, and <em>Diverted Units</em> is all the more welcome for bridging the gap.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/283534225&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>&quot;I wanted to take over the world with my music&quot;, reads an extract from an interview with Katja Lindeberg in 2015. Just over a year elapsed before her debut release, 'Swedish Tribal', arrived under the alias HAJ300, yet it would seem the crosshairs of world domination are finally well and truly aligned.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact this makes up her first release under the moniker, it would be misleading to present the EURO2000 released cassette as Lindeberg's first foray in electronic music. She is a founding member of the Stockholm based female and transgender collective Drömfakulteten, who are well-versed in live, improvisational electronics.</p>\n<p>Improvisation probably isn't a bad way to surmise the sounds included in the tape. The release is littered with idiosyncratic flourishes across a work which defies expectations. Dancefloor offerings are subverted by abrasive noise, at times breaking down completely. 'DU TAPPAR DET SA LATT' for example shifts forward jauntily, like something from Shed's 140 BPM experiment, The Panamax Project. Spine tingling screeches of noise burst out unexpectedly, building to a grinding climax amid tremoring waves of synthesiser.</p>\n<p>Static-workout 'FUCK IT WHO NEEDS MELODY' is another good example of this contrast with its unremitting dancefloor abrasion, while 'FIRE RED ENGINE' evokes Tresor-themed nightmares with earth-rumbling kicks, distant outcries and time warp sound effects. 'FULT I' &amp; 'FULT II' are similarly full-throttle; jackhammer low-end and amp-driven atmospherics ploughing roughshod over all in their path.</p>\n<p>Despite the generally rather foreboding tone of the release, there is dynamic here too. 'DEADLINE MASTER' sees the whole project collapse inwards, as HAJ300 momentarily becomes HAL 9000.  The combination of computerised voices, glitched-out synthetics and delicate ambience reminds me of some of AGF's work, yet with a streamlined, reductionist feel.</p>\n<p>If I'm being honest, I'm surprised this release hasn't garnered more attention. Lindeberg has tapped into an area which feels rather uncharted to me, her mastery of live electronics pushing the release into a space shared by few. This may be the first we've heard from the HAJ300 moniker, but I have every confidence it won't be the last. The tanks are on the lawn.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2825833563/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://euro2000.bandcamp.com/album/swedish-tribal\">SWEDISH TRIBAL by HAJ300</a></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>It's little surprise to see the name Leyland Kirby crop up on the Soundcloud profile of Alex Ives, aka Specimens. The sleeve of his recent  <em>Sculptures</em> LP could easily be taken from the latest installment of Kirby's Caretaker project.  Sonically there are crossovers too; for example a shared interest in ghostly re-imaginings of orchestral music from decades gone by. However it would be wrong to characterise this debut outing from First Terrace Records as a mere pastiche, as there is plenty of nuance and originality to appreciate.</p>\n<p>For the first release in the catalogue, its encouraging to see there have been no half measures taken. Alongside the stellar artwork, the album was mastered by Room 40's Lawrence English, an artist who will be well known to those engaged with ambient and acousmatic music more generally.</p>\n<p>For the most part, <em>Sculptures</em> is a rather serene, introspective ride. Graceful cinemascapes are layered with warm buzzes of distortion, calling to mind the work of Loscil, or Kompakt's Simon Scott. Take the gentle guitar resonances of 'VI.VI.MMXV' or the depth charge echoes of 'A Marble Hallway'. Both present their compositions through cloudy, aqueous textures creating an atmosphere both intense and reflective at the same time.</p>\n<p>Ives also makes strong use of sound-design and otherwise organic textures. 'Cerulean Forest Track' suspends the listener in the ether with delicate acousmatic tremblings, while the LP's centerpiece, 'Touch', emerges from a bed of electrical hums with ashen drones and hollowed out amp resonances. The use of foley is probably most fully explored across 'The Wrestler', a grunting web of overdrive backed by samples of Sudanese outdoor wrestling.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/287004262&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Ellie Smith.</em></p>\n<p>I first came across Chloe Frieda's Alien Jams in mid-2016, after hearing 'AJ004', a split 12&quot; from Beatrice Dillon and Karen Gwyer. On one side we were treated to a taut piece of computerized dub from Dillon - mindbending, yet raw and without unnecessary frills.  On the other, Gwyer supplied an excursion in nitro-charged acid drawing on influences from '70s psychedelia as much as contemporary electronics.</p>\n<p>In many ways the release makes a fitting example of what the label is all about; Frieda has focused on presenting sounds from both past and present since Alien Jams first began as an NTS show in 2011. &quot;My hope was to share strange and beautiful sounds&quot; she begins when asked on the show's original aims. &quot;I wanted to play music from throughout history, but started to realise there was a strong focus on present day musicians. The radio content is very similar to the type of music released on the label and often musicians will be involved or featured in the shows before they release a record on the label.&quot;</p>\n<p>Frieda made the leap from radio to label in 2013, with a release from Edmund Davies' oMMM project. From there, Alien Jams has moved from strength to strength, 2016 marking an undoubtedly important year for them. As well as Dillon and Gwyer's joint 12&quot;, Frieda released the 'Cutoff' EP from London based Robin Buckley, aka rkss. Speaking on the release, Frieda reflects on their first encounters. &quot;I think we first met in person at a gig a few years ago. Robin played at an Alien Jams night and I think that was our first meeting, although we had been in touch online shortly after the rkss release came out on Reject and Fade. That was such a great release.  The Alien Jams EP came together at the end of 2015- early 2016, with rkss material that had been recorded the previous year.&quot;</p>\n<p>Currently however, Frieda's sights are set on the future. Alongside a number of gigs, upcoming NTS shows and the relaunch of an event series she runs with fellow NTS-er DEBONAIR, Alien Jams' next outing is in the closing stages. &quot;Next is a release by NOCHEXXX called Planet Bangs&quot;, she explains when asked on future plans. &quot;It's due out next month.  We have been working on the release for a while so I'm really excited to share it. We were also lucky to have Zeke Clough do the album artwork which looks amazing!&quot;</p>\n<p>Frieda's mix for us covers 50 minutes of lo-fi rhythmic experiments and crunched-up 4/4, recorded with a little help from the NTS extended family. &quot;I recorded this mix at my friend DEBONAIR's house using her CDJs and turntables&quot;, she tells me. &quot;The mix is eclectic, every track is special in its own way.  I find that radio podcasts and mixes are very different from playing in a club, the feedback you get from playing to people in a space is totally unique, but mixes are satisfying in a different way, they can be meditative and reflective.&quot;</p>\n<p>No tracklist available.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0070-chloe-frieda%2F&light=1\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Josh Lobel</em></p>\n<p>Over six years and six full length albums, Derek Piotr's music has sustained a firm resistance against all satisfactory classification. On the one hand, he is a laptop sound designer, obsessed by technical minutiae of production trickery. On the other, he is a pure-at-heart singer, a folk musician in the most traditional sense. Back in 2013, we were treated to <a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/podcasts/66715091109\">a mix from Piotr</a>. We expected noise, field recordings and glitch. We got M.I.A, Omar Souleyman and Forest Swords. And after years of pushing his vocals into groundbreaking new territory, he released <em>Drono</em>, a record containing no discernible vocal performances whatsoever.</p>\n<p>So what, if anything, can define Piotr's sound? Are we in any capacity to pluck out the heart of its mystery? There is no single make-or-break factor that all of his music seems to share. Instead, there is a network of similarities, criss-crossing and cross-referencing one another. I couldn't list the go-to features of Piotr's expansive discography, but I know it when I hear it. Piotr's upcoming record, 'Forest People Pop', displaced his sound once again, from the murky shallows of drone to the glowing alter of pop. Albeit, radio-unfriendly pop. In light of this new release, we caught up with Piotr to talk Trump, Snowden and Missy Elliott.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/265562908&color=000000&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Last year you released <em>Drono</em>, a record with a marked departure from the microphone. Can you tell us a little bit about the making of that album and your feelings towards singing at the moment?</strong></p>\n<p>I always wanted to make drone for myself because I am fascinated by it. But I also knew that <em>Drono</em> would speak to a certain demographic of experimental music fans who would otherwise hate my work. I know my singing bothers some people, just as Joanna Newsom’s singing bothers some people or Bob Dylan, or Conor Oberst… voices are just naturally polarising. But a lot of experimental music fans are still stuck in the 90s, where vocals were used only sparingly in electronic music. You could get cut-up Destiny’s Child vocals or just a ‘hey’ or a ‘woah’ sound. But it was a bit taboo to have a vocal performance over your beats. My next record is going in the complete opposite direction: a shiny, complex pop record.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about this new record?</strong></p>\n<p>I have been listening to more and more acoustic music. I feel to some extent as if I should be an acoustic musician, but I’m not very good at playing acoustic instruments… and I have problems sonically with guitars and pianos and so on. I’m not really a performance-based musician. My strength is in studio editing. But I still love the sensation that you are listening to a performance rather than something programmed.</p>\n<p>If you listen to too many ‘producers’ you can get tunnel vision on their studio trickery and lose sight of the music. It’s weird — in the visual arts if you were to copy something, people would tell you that it’s wrong or that you shouldn’t do that. But if you copy a groove or beat or the way a hi-hat sounds, then people say how cool it is to flip that vibe — you know what I mean?</p>\n<p><strong>I know your vocals are heavily processed with auto-tune and other effects. But isn’t it your singing that gives your music that acoustic element?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah — part of the reason I like using vocals is because you can braid the acoustic and the electronic together. I think this is why people like pop music. It can be very processed and manicured but there’s still a human inside there, ultimately. I’ve been a vocalist since I was a child so it’s really the only instrument that I can perform well.</p>\n<p><strong>I think that the processing on your vocals is part of what makes your stuff unique. From where do you draw influence for those weird modal scales?   </strong></p>\n<p>Well I listen to a lot of Egyptian electro chaabi music and Raï music which are both ceremonial. There’s this great performer called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0m0s7yJmoU\">Hafida</a> who uses this strange auto-tune effect on her karaoke machine. I find it really interesting when you have these flattened modes set on the auto-tune and when you move to the boundaries of notes, you get this chromatic effect that the computer doesn’t really know what to do with.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://c1.staticflickr.com/1/606/32203600792_145b7df391_b.jpg\" alt=\"piotr\"></p>\n<p><strong>You once said that working with Meredith Monk in the past taught you the realisation that, “Words do not matter”. But this new album seems to contain some really intense lyrical content.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah — I still think that words do not matter to music. But this new album is meant to be a pop record, right? It’s not a typical pop record, it is deeply strangely shaped, I understand that. But in order to anchor this record as pop music, I needed love songs, verse-chorus structures and all that. I think there is an unwritten pact between you and the universe when you make art that the more you give out of yourself, the further the work can sail through the world. So I felt as though I should address topics that I have never sung about before: songs about love, pain, whatever.</p>\n<p><strong>There’s even a rap from Banx about climate change, right?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah — I feel like since all my records have hitherto avoided touching upon politics, I have earned the right to make reference to something like Trump or whatever. I also hope that a lot of people find humour in my music. I love absurdity in music. Missy Elliot is a genius, and part of how she achieves that is through making all these absurd and humourous noises with her mouth. I wanted to push the humour a bit with this record. A lot of people say my music is dark but I disagree.</p>\n<p><strong>I feel like <em>Drono</em> was a very dark record, if only in comparison to <em>Bahar</em>.</strong></p>\n<p>Really? I see it as totally uplifting and luminous music. Then again, a lot of my music is optimistically melancholic. That feeling where you are kind of distraught by life, where you are freaked out by the mundanity of everything, but you are nonetheless channeling this light energy, where you feel possessed by this connection with the world despite everything. St Vincent captures that feeling really well too, I think.</p>\n<p><strong>So back to your new record. What is ‘Forest People Pop’? A genre? </strong></p>\n<p>I find the idea of starting a ‘forest people pop’ movement funny. Or as a hashtag or something. I like to think of it as a genre too. A lot of electronic music at the moments seems to be really tense, clean and squeaky. I don’t want to name names but it’s as if everyone wants to be Holly Herndon all of a sudden. My intent with this record was to use some of that style but in a way that is more earthy, more wooly, more splintered… As if you were watching an Edward Snowden live-stream from a bamboo hut.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/180700207?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>Why is it that you want to distance yourself from that music?</strong></p>\n<p>I wanted this record to be like a second child — one who wears hand-me-downs and has uncombed hair and doesn’t care so much about being late for school. In the last two or three years there has been a lot of hyper-squeaky, urban, dark, zeitgeist-y, aggressive, impressive hybrid music. There are so many producers we could name here. My immediate reaction to that stuff was that it was disgusting. But as I’ve lived with some of it, I’ve come to realise that it’s just not ‘lived in’ enough.</p>\n<p>For example, take ‘lemonade’ by SOPHIE. It’s the kind of thing that’s very meme-able and the first time I heard it I thought, ‘oh my god I need to send this to at least 15 people, this is some crazy shit…’ But after a few listens you realise that it’s too much. It’s over the top. Whereas when I listen to Radiohead, I initially think it’s fucking boring, but 10 listens later and I’m in love. So it’s a tradeoff. You either have music that is immediately satisfying that wears you out, or something that is mysterious at first but becomes your best friend. It’s really hard to find both, but that’s what I tried to do with my new record.</p>\n<p><strong>There must be a strange atmosphere in the US right now with Trump inauguration coming up. Some have been saying, perhaps erroneously, that it will trigger a new wave of angry, political art. What do you think?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m always a little wary about joining political movements just because I think they tend to create a division between people. Like if you’re not in camp A, then you must be in camp B. I think that attitude is really dangerous for me. But my new year’s resolution is to be more expressive and more compassionate. I think everyone that I know is queer to some degree. I don’t mean that I have a circle of queer friends, but every person in every walk of life that I know has some expressiveness about themselves or some queerness that they recognise. I don’t necessarily mean queer as in a sexual preference but there’s something revolutionary in the way they think.</p>\n<p>In the states right now, it feels very ‘now or never’. If I don’t speak up and make an effort to fill someone’s eye with flowers in my day to day life, then I am guilty somehow. The day after Trump got in, people were literally crying in New York. The subway was completely dead. Everyone was totally flabbergasted and horrified. So I feel like I need to do my part to be more expressive and more involved in the way the climate is, try to offer some sort of beauty to address this. You’ll probably never see me at a rally but I just want to colour the air with awareness and defiance.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/269509749&color=000000&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>A name like ‘An Epic Label’ necessitates music bold enough to justify it. I first became aware of the label with ’Pathways’, a striking EP from neo-minimalist producer Martin Thompson. At the time, this marked a conspicuous departure from Thompson’s earlier work. The early forays on his own label, SM-LL, are intense and difficult. But this was melodic, layered, accessible. An Epic seems to be the place in which artists can do this — to express a hitherto undisclosed side of themselves.</p>\n<p>Over the past few months, Japanese artist Durusin has been pushing his sound into faster tempos under a new moniker: Soo. These experiments are <em>much</em> darker, closer to the murky world of Hidden Hawaii than the HD sheen of SM-LL. But his latest release contains yet another departure, this time into some wonky, lopsided experimental hip-hop. And when musicians digress, ‘An Epic’ accommodates.</p>\n<p>Take the opener, ‘Cut’. The beats on this are constantly wrong-footing. They clamber forward with uncertain determination, like a toddler’s first steps. There’s also ‘Lp38’ and ‘Wan’: snapshots of atmosphere overdriven with cassette-tape crunch. One thing that’s refreshing about this release is its brevity. Someone like Vladislav Delay or Jan Jelinek may have stretched these jams out to ten minutes or more. But Durusin makes his peace and moves on with haste.</p>\n<p>This is what romantic composer Eric Satie would have deemed ‘furniture music’. Though not in contempt. It isn’t ‘furniture’ in the sense of being superfluous or decorative. But in the sense that it doesn’t impose itself on your personal space. It creates instead a landscape that you can belong to. It exists not to grab your attention, but to colour the air.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 373px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2512024522/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/artwork=none/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://anepic.bandcamp.com/album/evnkt-ep\">evnkt EP by Durusin</a></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>We have algorithms co-ordinating our dating lives, the stock market and online retailing. James Ball, the Guardian’s data editor and member of the paper’s NSA Files reporting team described the algorithm as, “The god from the machine powering them all, for good or ill.” Indeed, one of the more disturbing dimensions of algorithmic implementation is in “Minority Report” policing. Here, statistical analyses of big data target crime “hot spots”. The aim of such an approach is to predict crimes before they are committed. In 2005, the Memphis police department used this in operation Blue CRUSH (short for Crime Reduction Using Statistical History), in which the department arrested 70 people in under two hours.</p>\n<p>It was only a matter of time before algorithms started making music. Any time we use a computer, algorithms are being used. So in some sense, all computer music is algorithmic. All the way back to Kraftwerk and beyond. But lately, electronic music has taken a step forward; receding the shores of human input even further from the process. In recent memory, Mark Fell, TCF, Shotahirama and Second Woman have all been writing algorithms to play with our expectations. They present the almost impossible task of discerning the organic from the mechanical; the ghost from the machine. And the likes Autechre, AGF and Detroit Underground have been pushing this idea for years. The results are always challenging, dark and impressive. If police use algorithms to predict crimes of the future, musicians use them to create the future of sound.</p>\n<p>The latest release to explore these ideas comes from US-based producer, mtch. This latest LP from German imprint Kaer’Uiks is a true onslaught of sound. From its very first bar, <em>Dplx Cut Optr</em> projects a torrent of data. With what sounds like an infinite range of permutations and combinations swirling around one another in the mix. The production, too, gives the album a mighty drive. Every tidbit glitch or burst of reverb comes loud and clear. This may owe itself to the mastering of Yu Miyashita, better known as Yaporigami and one half of Signal Arrow. The album closes with one final K.O: ‘Tdif’ is the most listenable, melodic and groovy track of the record. But listening, singing or dancing to this is advised with caution.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 406px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1327705792/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/artwork=none/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://kaer-uiks.bandcamp.com/album/dplx-cut-optr\">Dplx Cut Optr by Mtch</a></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Carsten Stiller.</em></p>\n<p>Swarm Intelligence takes a hammer to the usual techno blueprint, reassembling it in haphazard fashion. Since his early releases in 2011/12, the Berlin-based Simon Hayes has developed a knack for crafting broken-beat 4/4 and downcast melodics which add a little more depth to the dancefloor than the usual format. His albums on Nicolas Chevraux's Ad Noiseam might be a good first reference in attempting to pinpoint his sound; he has as much in common with the label's earlier forays into savage noise and breakcore as the more contemplative recent offerings.</p>\n<p>Later this month, Hayes will be visiting London to play Towards Collapse; an event series which stares down the capitalist machine with nihilism and humour in equal measure. &quot;Broken beats and bass to drag your feet to as you stumble&quot;, reads their latest flyer - perhaps a fitting primer when considering not just Hayes,  but also the rest of the lineup. Fellow Berliner Dead Fader, as well as VORRS, Nolan Dialta, Codex Europa and the expertly-named DJ Bin Fetish will also join the bill at Dalston's VFD on <a href=\"http://vfdalston.com/fri-17-feb-towards-collapse/\">February 17</a>.</p>\n<p>With the show just a few weeks away, and an upcoming EP on Instruments of Discipline, we decided to invite Hayes to contribute to our <em>That Time When</em> series, discussing five of his most memorable gigging experiences.</p>\n<p>###1 Kildare_2002</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/572/31824507203_baae33b0ef_z.jpg\" alt=\"q\"></p>\n<p>I remember getting a free CD with a copy of Mixmag back in 2002, cringingly titled <em>Italian Techno Master</em>. It was mixed by none other than Mauro Picotto. Being about 16 and into hard dance at the time, this totally blew me away. Like the rest of my aspiring DJ mates, I had plenty of Mauro’s big hits on vinyl at that stage but this was a side of him I hadn’t heard before. That same year, he played Creamfields in Ireland. A friend and I snuck our way in. At that age, I had never experienced anything like it – it was absolute bedlam! I remember Mauro Picotto played a set really close in sound to this CD and I left a changed man – I’d just had my first taste of proper techno.</p>\n<p>###2 Dublin_2006</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/304/31824507473_4dbb8206b5_b.jpg\" alt=\"q\"></p>\n<p>Another pivotal moment came when I was 20. I’d listened to Autechre, but I guess I wasn’t a huge fan or anything at that stage. This all changed at a gig at the Temple Bar Music Centre. It was during the <em>Untilted</em> tour. Autechre played with all the lights off, save for a glowing lamp above their equipment. The sound – it was unlike anything I’d experienced before, completely transcending and otherworldly. I left the venue in a daze. Looking back, I reckon this could be where the Swarm Intelligence sound began forming.</p>\n<p>###3 Dublin_2008</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/653/31824507813_13de9e33e0_b.jpg\" alt=\"p\"></p>\n<p>Dublin has always had an absolutely kicking techno scene. There were so many good gigs that it’s hard to pick a favourite but there’s one weekend that really stands out; The Dublin Electronic Arts Festival was a four day event that was sprawled throughout venues and galleries all across the city. Run by the veteran label D1 Recordings, the line-ups were always brilliantly curated – not only did they book some great international acts but there was always huge support for local artists and promoters.</p>\n<p>The 2008 edition was no different, at the time a few friends and I were also running events as Stasis Collective. We brought over Rob Hall on the Friday of the festival, which went down a storm. Rob was great and a real gent to top it off. Saturday event saw a line up of Regis, Sunil Sharpe and ADJ and was hosted by Test, which was another belter. The highlight of the weekend for me however was the closing night on the Sunday.</p>\n<p>First of all, let me describe the venue. McGruders was essentially an old man’s pub that had somehow become a raver’s haven. Tables and chairs were pushed aside to make dancefloors out of beer-soaked carpets and massive sound systems were hauled in. On the bill were the fathers of Slovak techno – Loktibrada and Rumenige. At the time I was quite into clicky, bleepy minimal techno and electronica but nothing put a smile on my face like the absolute, utter pounding those lads gave the crowd that night. I’ve had a soft spot for that brand of broken techno ever since.</p>\n<p>###4 Berlin_2012</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/290/32636504315_3402f12b6b_b.jpg\" alt=\"c\"></p>\n<p>A year or so later, I moved to Berlin. I must admit, I felt like a bit of an outsider in the beginning. There were so many gigs happening, that I didn’t really click with a crowd or venue, at least not to the extent of how things were in Dublin.</p>\n<p>This all changed when a friend of mine, Dean Rodell, told me he was starting his own club – Subland. Subland quickly became a home away from home. Weekend after weekend you knew you were in for a pummeling. With a sound system so huge it was almost silly, and a soundtrack of the harder, darker and weirder stuff that had been amiss for me up until then in Berlin, it was one of my favourite spots in the city.</p>\n<p>A year or two after opening, Dean teamed up with Nicolas from Ad Noiseam to run the Burn The Machine festival. For 2012’s edition, he asked Monolog and myself to play live together. I am not sure if I have ever had that much fun playing a gig, we both tore parts from our own live sets and let rip, completely improvising on the night. I think we ended up playing for almost 2 hours, finishing with me bashing out rave stabs on some pads and Mads doing live drums. There’s an excerpt on my Soundcloud page somewhere. Since then, we started a project called Diasiva and have a couple of releases under our belts. Subland has unfortunately closed, though it has since reopened under new management and is now called Void.</p>\n<p>###5 Oberhausen_2015</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/543/31824506903_4451b4bf85_b.jpg\" alt=\"d\"></p>\n<p>Through Subland, I became friends with Nicolas and ended up releasing two albums on Ad Noiseam. This led to one of my most memorable performances to date – Maschinenfest. This infamous noise, industrial and power electronics festival has been running since 2009 and has a massive following. People come from far and wide to attend each year. Back in 2015, I’d just released Rust and had built a new live set around it. My girlfriend had done the photography and one drunken evening, we came up with the idea that she’d do visuals for the set. So, basically she had a month or two to learn the software, film and edit the footage and rehearse it all. She somehow pulled it all off and it ended up being one of the best live sets I’ve done – the visuals were amazing! There’s some grainy footage on YouTube that doesn’t half do it justice.</p>\n<p><em>Tickets for February 17 are available via the Towards Collapse Bandcamp, <a href=\"https://towardscollapse.bandcamp.com/merch/towards-collapse-3-17th-february-2017-vfd-swarm-intelligence-deadfader-vorrs-nolan-dialta-codex-europa\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/202389808&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Bastakiya Tapes: the foreboding, angsty younger sister of Bedouin Records. Despite their differences, the sibling labels together form something of a synthetic whole. Bedouin situate their roster on the dance-floor, albeit a grubby basement of a dance-floor. You can find J Tijn’s overdriven acid, Eomac’s 6am techno and even a ghettohouse mixtape from Traxman. But the Bastakiya Tapes are isolated and lonesome. They are for headphone listening, in the sullen adolescent bedroom of the mind. Bedouin for Saturday night boogie; Bastakiya for Sunday morning blues.</p>\n<p>The latest in the Bastakiya series comes from Memotone, a producer known for his restless departure between styles. All the way from wonky hip-hop to neo-classical. But this album opens like a Tom Waits instrumental. Block chords of dusty clarinets blast through a busted gramophone. On ‘You Are All in Disagreement,’ cello strings swoop in and out of the mix in disorienting glissando. On ‘Burnt Forest,' the strings take a darker turn, hissing out in sharp, distorted spikes. The whole album feels like walking through a forgotten antique shop. Therein, you find squeaky hinges, creaky floorboards and drunk pianos.</p>\n<p>If these are Memotone’s collected ideas on people, the people in question are from a different time, accessible only through memory. The melodies are childlike and pretty; but bent out of shape into something broken and demented.  The album closes with 'What It Could Have Been': a grandiose sound collage and defiant full stop.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 439px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1531506352/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/artwork=none/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://bastakiyatapes.com/album/collected-ideas-on-people\">Collected Ideas On People by Memotone</a></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Hidden Hawaii had something of a revitalising effect on my interest in D&amp;B when I first discovered them a year or so ago. It's principal founders Felix K and Wan.2 had happened on a sound largely untapped, combining Chain Reaction style dub-ambience, with buzzing, glitch-heavy D&amp;B. The monikers found within their discography such as 'Ena', 'A.N.D.' or 'Flxk1' perhaps give some sense of the reductionist, computer sounds they are focused on; with Hidden Hawaii you have to listen to the \t<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbeilmP2wY8\">notes they're <em>not</em> playing</a>.</p>\n<p>The latest dispatch from the label makes up their second LP-length release. The eponymously-titled <em>Elemnts</em> album is a combined effort from Felix K and Dylan Brownsword, aka DB1, recorded at Felix's studio in Berlin across a series of jam sessions. While other Hidden Hawaii releases have flirted with styles outside of 160+ tempos, the <em>Elemnts</em> LP feels like the label's most diverse affair yet. There is plenty of faster material to enjoy here, such as the nimble-footed 'Water #1' or low-riding 'Square #3', yet arguably, the slower, techno-speed offerings are where the album finds its strongest footing.</p>\n<p>Take the twitching, submerged glitch of 'Water #3'. The track feels constantly on the verge of bursting out into a full Chris Liebling style smoke-cannon thumper, squelching acid and off-kilter bleeps remaining just below boiling point. 'Octagon #1' &amp; 'Octagon #2' also make good examples, the former thundering forward with low-slung beaters and grainy swells of static, while the latter makes for a bug-eyed early-hours meditation, reminiscent of some of Andreas Tilliander's more rambling experiments.</p>\n<p>At other points the duo discard rhythm almost entirely. Take the metal-chambered 'Water #4', or oscillator tearaway, 'Square #2'. 'Circle of Light #3' also takes this approach, making for one of the most memorable listens on the album; data-moshed atmospherics and achingly sparse percussive hits swaying together in unison.</p>\n<p>As their first collaboration, <em>Elemnts</em> feels remarkably cohesive and unstrained. DB1's previous releases have all come via the Hidden Hawaii imprint so perhaps it's of little wonder their tastes are well aligned, yet its still an impressive feat to put together a release of this depth in a more or less live fashion.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/294202814&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p>Between the cold concrete slabs of Berghain, Tresor and the umpteen industrial warehouses that litter Berlin, a vibrant and novel sound emerged. The stagnant reputation of floor-thump techno seems to be finally shedding. In its place: a new subculture. Take as starters, Bill Kouligas' Pan imprint. Which, through the release of several watershed albums from the likes of Objekt, Helm and M.E.S.H, became a guiding light into this unknown world. Next, Berlin's Janus parties opened a space in which these sounds could be <em>moved</em> to. M.E.S.H joined Lotic and KABLAM as residents. They brought wheel-ups, mash-ups and break-downs back into the repertoire of Berlin clubs.</p>\n<p>It would be simplistic to assume that a label such as STAYCORE has done nothing more than continue this trajectory in another direction. For one thing, the label is based in Stockholm. For another, the label's roster is fresh, the only real crossover artist being KABLAM. Yet, during the STAYCORE showcase at this year's CTM festival in Berlin, it was hard to decontextualise the label from what has recently emerged in the city. There were explosion effects, future grime and R&amp;B drops. But to immediately canonise a label in its infancy would be a fatal error. We therefore decided, following her set at the notorious Panorama Bar, to catch up with STAYCORE-mainstay, mobilegirl...</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/297459934&color=070707&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Firstly, congratulations — seemingly counter to everyone else’s experience, 2016 was a great year for you. Can you give us a rundown of the last 12 months and where you see the Mobilegirl project now?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh no that comparison feels so guilt loaded but thank you (laughs). It’s been quite a packed year, something I didn’t expect at all. I moved to Berlin a few months before 2016 and from there things changed and developed so rapidly that I ended last year with a tour around Asia! I couldn’t even the possibility of doing something like that in 2015. Right now, I’m just excited to see what’s coming next.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you compare playing between continents?</strong></p>\n<p>I don't tend to shift what I play between where I play it. But it definitely felt really special to be able to play so far away from home. There is a difference in the mentality though. The circumstances are just utterly different. Berlin is especially is spoilt while cities in East Asia are on the rise. People are actually moving things.</p>\n<p><strong>There seems to have been a bit of a recent shake-up in Berlin by artists like yourself. Do you think of Berlin still a home to innovation?</strong></p>\n<p>I don’t think Berlin will lose its drive anytime soon. Generally sounds and development of sounds have become quite globalized through the Internet, so what actually matters is giving certain music a space to exist in real life. I think Berlin offers a lot of possibilities for that.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of which, you just played this year's CTM festival at the notorious Panorama Bar. What can you tell us a little bit about how your set went? </strong></p>\n<p>I always like to have a nice mixture between parts that are straight up danceable and parts that are meant to be actively listened to. A <em>lot</em> of acapellas.  \n<img src=\"http://c1.staticflickr.com/1/384/32373272420_6b8f172b9a_c.jpg\" alt=\"x\"></p>\n<p><strong>Yeah, your live sets are famed for their generous throwbacks to 90’s R&amp;B classics, all the way from J-Lo to Sisqó. Can you tell us a little bit about your relation to this period of music and its influence on you?  </strong></p>\n<p>I started actively listening to music as a kid when I would go to my aunt’s place and would go through my older cousin’s Winamp. Most of her playlists were filled with R&amp;B so that really stuck with me. I like playing and referencing that music because I feel like for both me and the crowd it provides a little comfort through familiarity.</p>\n<p><strong>Would you describe yourself as an official affiliate of Staycore? Is there any divergence between your self and the label that you see as important?  </strong></p>\n<p>Oh yeah I definitely see myself as a core member. I think we, within Staycore, all have quite different aesthetics which set us apart from each other but that’s definitely a benefit rather than anything that needs to be compromised or discussed.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about the label in general — is there an ethos that underpins it?  </strong></p>\n<p>The tagline that has manifested is clear and obvious: <em>&quot;stay true to your core&quot;</em>. The direction within the label is rather free, following our individual taste and ideas. It’s mostly about having a place to express yourself without feeling pressured.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about your approach to writing music? The impression I get is that you feel more comfortable re-working existing tracks than spawning something entirely new. Is that fair to say? </strong></p>\n<p>I’ve been working on original productions and aim to release something later this year. So far I’ve just felt more comfortable with putting out remixes as I have a quite different approach to those than to my other productions. They don’t have this strong self-representation factor that I dread but are rather a reaction or expression of appreciation towards certain pre-existing songs where I see the focus on those and not on myself.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/213980852&color=0f0e0e&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>The defining triad of this year’s CTM festival was FEAR, ANGER, LOVE. A theme appropriately broad, as the festival has enormous scope, though it may at first glance appear to be too all-encompassing to carry any real meaning. Doesn't all art express some form of fear, anger or love? Then again, the festival is decidedly pluralistic. It tries not to push a message home, but allows the artists to do their thing. It can be a daunting task to see even a fraction of the events on at CTM. You can find music, films, exhibitions, talks and workshops stretching out over 10-days, 15 venues and 173 acts. Any review of the festival will thus be a mere snapshot. But here are some of our highlights.</p>\n<p>A welcoming introduction featured an exhibition exploring the past and present of experimental music and sound art in Mexico. Entitled ‘Critical Constellations of the Audio-Machine in Mexico’, the exhibition explored the musical styles and sound experiments that have emerged in the country since the beginning of the 20th Century. It followed the role of machines in modernisation and the logics of rupture in resisting a neo-liberal takeover of the country. There were sculptures made of magnetic cassette tape, non(or anti)-conventional musical scores and instruments made with ‘unstable tunings’, that shifted up and down into a nauseating trance. Artists also argued for Mexico City as a place of futurism. Not a futurism forged through a series of well-organised efforts, but one which emerged through a bustling rhythm of contradictions. It’s a city that maintains a difficult mix of technical and industrial modernism with pre-Hispanic indigenous cultural identity. Whether intentional or not, it worked as a forceful ‘fuck you’ to the Trump-laced racism of our present moment.</p>\n<p>Almost embodying this futurism channelled through the past — not to mention the ‘fuck you’ to the present — was Elysia Crampton’s presence at the festival. Gliding onto the stage at the Festsaal Kreuzberg she quietly announced ‘I’m going to ask the ancestors for help with this one’. It was clear she received the help she had asked for, appearing almost possessed as contemplative midi piano chords swelled into her signature collage of abrasive SFX samples and pentatonic spirals, with Crampton at one point leaving her keyboard to screech into the microphone. All traces of the previous night’s hangover were effectively shaken out of the audience. Crampton’s performance was illuminated (but by no means circumscribed) by a discussion she took part in with Hengameh Yaghoobifarah and Tactical Technology collective member Leil Zahra a few days before. As opposed to being a lecture from on high, this discussion fostered solidarity and collectivity both through the intimacy of the space and through the fact that each discussant made revealing and tender contributions alongside more pragmatic debates over what sort of tactics could be used for resistance and survival. The ‘we’ that spoke in these conversations was never patronising or falsely unifying, but allowed for a shared experience of anger and love (and of course, fear).</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3743/32480040920_105698e519_h.jpg\" alt=\"ely\">\n<em>Elysia Crampton. Photo by Udo Siegfriedt.</em></p>\n<p>The warmth of such a space was somewhat lost in the larger discussion ‘Against Neutrality: What can a Decolonised Dancefloor Do?’, a panel chaired by the wonderful cultural critic and DJ madison moore and featuring nkisi, Diana Arce, Kiddy Smile, Aérea Negrot and Mic Oala. While the thrust of the discussion felt urgent, the format (by no fault of the individual artists) seemed to lend itself more to the advertising of personal projects and occasionally bordered on prescriptions of the correct forms of consumption. But when given the chance to let the work speak for itself it was clear the political import went far beyond the (temporal and spatial) limits of the discussion. nkisi put it best in her framing of sound itself as a form of knowledge, and of the dancefloor as a kind of commons that could itself create new forms of community and relations. While it may be the case that artists aren’t always the best at explicating the politics of their own work, one of the benefits of CTM was that there was the opportunity to see both the art and the artist in action, and so discussions like this were never intended to stand alone.</p>\n<p>The festival also held up a space for artists within a particular geographical enclave, including Norwegian dance music and the international African diaspora of the NON collective. One such partnership with Tehran’s SET festival presented works at the forefront of the Iranian capital’s electronic music scene. In an exciting commission entitled “Sacred Horror In Design,” Ata Ebtekar (aka Sote) collaborated with performers Arash Bolouri and Behrouz Pashaei on a project merging electronics with traditional Persian acoustic instruments (santoor and setar) for a &quot;Persian techno apocalypse.&quot; The evening paradoxically preserved Persian traditionalism while simultaneously bending it out of all recognition. In a talk on contemporary sound in Iran, Sote spoke of the city’s defiance against exoticism and pigeon-holing. Iran is one of the seven countries Trump has attempted to ban travel from, and such defiance and clarity is therefore clearly needed. But when asked what Tehran’s noise scene is operating in response to, Ebtekar simply replied, “pollution”.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2327/32707030782_edc9cc28c1_h.jpg\" alt=\"sot\">\n<em>Sote, Arash Bolouri and Behrouz Pashaei. Photo by Stefanie Kulisch.</em></p>\n<p>One of the more unexpected (but welcome) experiences of the festival was seeing the experimental vocalist Stine Janvin Motland, who preceded fellow Scandinavian avant-pop prodigy Jenny Hval. Motland’s performance is technically quite simple to describe: a half-hour of highly precise and uninterrupted circular singing with a delay effect which forced antagonistic frequencies to collide, while a light stuttered against her sharp outline. Yet the effect was far too visceral to describe with any sense of accuracy, the sound consuming the entire space of the massive Hebbel am Ufer. Perhaps the closest description would be to imagine how Homer’s sirens would have sounded if they had been intended to drive men away, or perhaps more contemporaneously, they suggested the mechanical siren which calls out our current state of emergency, constant and unrelenting.</p>\n<p>The expressed intention of CTM festival is to, “Make space for radical forms of musical expression and dissonant emotions”. Part of what makes this an interesting project is its incongruence against the staples of Berlin music culture. Berlin’s industrial spaces have been repurposed to accommodate sounds at the periphery. The concrete slabs and towering walls that Berlin is so well known for are imbued with a different meaning. It now makes sense to hear ‘Hotline Bling’ in Berghain. The city’s stagnant insistence of floor-thump 4X4 and brooding ambient seems to be finally shedding. The city owes something to CTM for decoupling these spaces from their techno-alliance. As Plato once said, “when the mode of the music changes, the walls of the city shake.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://c1.staticflickr.com/1/454/32707666092_642608588a_h.jpg\" alt=\"kreuz\">\n<em>Kunsthaus Bethanien.

    "content": "<p>Once describing his sound as 'live concrète', Palermo born artist Valerio Tricoli uses reel-to-reel tape recorders and a host of effects to collage sound manipulations on the fly. Releasing on labels such as Bill Kouligas' PAN, Entr'acte and Bowindo, the results conjure themes of space and mysticism, making it hard to tell whether his work would be best suited 300 in the past, or 300 years in the future. Mid-last-year for example he released <em>Clonic Earth</em>, a work of epic scale exploring some rather lofty existential and metaphysical ideas; fractured UFO modulations intercept with sunken choral timbres and his own faded spoken word, making for some powerful moments.</p>\n<p>Tricoli is also no stranger to collaboration. He was a founding member of avante-rock group 3/4HadBeenEliminated, additionally having released collaborative offerings with the likes of Thomas Ankersmit, Antoine Chennex and Hanno Leichtmann on the beautifully muddled 'The Future of Discipline'.</p>\n<p>Next week, Valerio will play alongside Kondaktor, Heith &amp; Giulio Nocera as part of a one-off event in Milan for Greek promoters, Fasma. With the show just around the corner, we decided to catch up with Tricoli to talk musique concréte, Jérôme Noetinger and the violence of religion.</p>\n<p><strong>You're playing alongside Heith &amp; Giulio Nocera on the 18th for Fasma. Is travel a part of your work you enjoy? What's it like having to transport reel-to-reels and other sensitive equipment around?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s a pain in the ass! (laughs) It’s really problematic. As much as I can I try  not to travel by plane - I can fly with my Revox but every now and then it gets broken in transit. Fortunately, in all these years it’s only happened once where I’ve had to basically cancel the gig because the gear was broken. That was last year in London. It actually broke while I was playing… I was playing for like 15 minutes and the sound just disappeared on one channel. I had to stop half way through as I couldn’t tell whether it was the Revox or the mixer, or something else that was broken.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/63161761?color=ffffff&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"340\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>Your live shows are largely improvisational. Is this the approach you've always taken to gigs?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s totally improvised. Unless I play two gigs in a row and the night before I do something that I really like. Then maybe I would try to do it again - it’s not going to be exactly the same, but it might be similar. The form is improvised, but the actual sounds are the total opposite, as they are mostly pre-recorded and fed and manipulated with the tape machine in real time.</p>\n<p>I’ve always worked in that way. Up until 2010 I would sometimes play with the Revox; sometimes just with the mixer with different sound sources and effects - basically another way to compose in real time some sort of concrète music, but without the tapes. Today I only play with the Revox, it’s very hard to convince promoters to let me play without it, as it became something as a trademark of my live sets.</p>\n<p>In May I’m actually going to try and do a gig without the Revox. I have to play on a film in Gent, I don’t even know which film it is yet. It will be an experimental film, it’s at a film festival. I think i'll compose something specific for it and perform it live with CDJs and that kind of things. But, who knows…</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/188106765&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I saw William Basinski play in a church in East London a few years ago. I guess he has a similar kind of setup...</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, but it is a very different approach. Sometimes he as a reel-to-reel, but the big difference is that he plays loops which are ready made. He has all these loops which he’s been collecting since like the ’80s. He was doing this shit since <em>way</em> before he made <em>The Disintegration Loops</em>, when he kind of made it big. He would come with these loops, some of them already fucked up in some way, mostly just by time itself, and normally play them through a reverb unit. He plays them back very slowly, one on top of the other. So it’s kind of a post-Brian Eno type of thing.</p>\n<p>In my case, my tape loop is always new - when I start the concert it’s blank. I have sounds from a computer, which I use basically as a sampler. I have a computer keyboard with the name of the files on the keys. So I would click one sound and that’s like, for example, sounds of women. I take portions of the sounds and manipulate them and transform them while I’m recording them on the tape, so it’s a very different process. In my case, the Revox is a live sampling apparatus. In the case of Basinski, it’s a playback device of a very special nature. I’ve seen him play two or three times. I’ve also seen him playing back the loops from a computer and the difference in terms of deepness of sound was pretty big.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you first come across the Revox?</strong></p>\n<p>Through Jérôme Noetinger. I can easily describe Jérôme as probably the best ever performer on electronics of all time. If you ever in your life have the opportunity to see him then do. His discography is really small. Solo material, if I'm not mistaken there is just one record from like twenty years ago called <em>Glorie à</em> and some pieces on compilations and such. Essentially he’s a performer. He’s someone you should really listen to live to get the level of insane genius and ability that he has.</p>\n<p>When somebody thinks someone like myself is good at playing the Revox, they are really mistaken! Jérôme is good at playing the Revox. His biggest project is called <em>Cellule d’Intervention Metamkine</em> and that’s him playing Revox’s and other electronics in front of a real time expanded cinema made with 16mm projections. An arsenal of lenses and shadows - it’s fucking amazing man. There might be something on YouTube, but live, it’s easily the best thing I’ve seen in my life.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/18846797&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I believe I'm right in saying you're from Palermo, Sicily. Were you brought up there? What were your early experiences of musique concrète like?</strong></p>\n<p>I left Sicily when I was 18 and moved to Bologna, I went to University there. I stayed it Bologna for about 12 years, then moved to Berlin in 2007 or 2008, and then here in Munich in 2012.</p>\n<p>My first exposure to musique concrète came from different works of the late ’90s; what was happening in experimental music around then. That was very much through labels like Metamkine and so on. Lots of newer concrète music but older concrète music too. From those records I started to dig into the history of it, but I got there through slightly more traditional music.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/399/32067489613_ccce1a04d1_z.jpg\" alt=\"val\"></p>\n<p><strong>For <em>Miseri Lares</em>, you sampled text from the works of Dante, HP Lovecraft, and your own writings. How do you think these shape the narrative/mood of the album?</strong></p>\n<p>This is the thing, when I start to work on a record I don’t really have an idea what the concept is going to be. So, let’s say I start making some music, then I start understanding what the record is going to be. I start eliminating all the stuff that doesn’t fit, and produce new sound materials which are strongly related with the concept that materialised in my mind.</p>\n<p>When I got the narrative for <em>Miseri Lares</em> I enhanced it using literary quotes that would reflect the character of the music itself. In the case of <em>Miseri Lares</em>, Lovecraft, and Italian poet Guido Ceronetti for example. It’s interesting with <em>Miseri Lares</em> because a lot of it uses poems in which the boundaries between bodies and houses and living spaces are actually disappearing, for example.</p>\n<p>All these texts, I spoke them so that the content would not be easily understandable. At the same time, I have the feeling that it is there in a more subtle, subconscious way to understand. In the case of <em>Miseri</em> Lares, and also <em>Clonic Earth</em>, I used texts which have this kind of oracular feel, texts which I would not be ready to listen to myself. It’s a way to say: here is the truth (or the so-called truth) but you’re not going to grasp it easily, or you don’t have to grasp it at all because it’s dangerous. To a certain extent it’s also a subtle trick to add suspense to the music.</p>\n<p><strong>How did <em>Clonic Earth</em> develop out of <em>Miseri Lares</em>?</strong></p>\n<p>With <em>Miseri Lares</em>, I started with simple sounds. Like small bricks, one after the other - really precise sounds that don’t have any history. So I composed it in a very intellectual way. <em>Clonic Earth</em>, instead, is based on semi-random tape compositions. The reel, the proto-compositions so to say, are then recorded into Pro Tools, and that’s how I get the initial structure, the skeleton of every piece.</p>\n<p>In this way, I suppose I can achieve a different kind of organism, maybe less artificial. But ultimately I think <em>Clonic Earth</em> is a more intellectual album than <em>Miseri Lares</em>. They are very much linked but I would say <em>Miseri Lares</em> is more terrestrial, whereas Clonic Earth is more abstract or spiritual. <em>Clonic Earth</em> is more about being lost in the mind, so to say.</p>\n<p><strong>It seems like you come back to themes like religion, philosophy and the metaphysical quite a lot. Where does that come from? Does religion play into your music?</strong></p>\n<p>Of course, I am Italian, so it goes with saying that religion played a part in my childhood. At my schools there would be nuns and priests, we would go to church and so on. When I grew up I rejected these kind of influences, but following experiences in later life, experiences which we could describe as entheogenic, well, I rediscovered an interest in the spiritual.</p>\n<p><strong>I've spent a bit of time in Italy around Florence and Tuscany, and whether you are religious or not there is definitely a social and cultural weight to it.</strong></p>\n<p>It’s everywhere. In Sicily where I grew up, religion is not just a matter of simple belief, it’s everywhere. It’s the culture. All those kind of weird processions, people beating themselves, crypts with mummified priest and so on...</p>\n<p>I was having this conversation with the grandmother of my son who is very religious. She’s German but she’s lived in Palermo for a long time. I bought a t-shirt for my son, black, with a jolly roger. We were at her house and she was like “how could you buy this, it’s so grim. Why should a child have to look at a skull?” I couldn’t resist pointing at the crucifix in the room we were sitting in: a dying, tortured man with blood coming out of his head, his hands, his feet, his chest… You can understand what I said after!</p>\n<p>As kids in Palermo we were supposed to behave in a religious manner all the time. This probably made me initially understand spirituality in a very un-steinerian way. A very earthly spirituality. My family weren’t very religious at all but nevertheless you couldn’t escape it.</p>\n<p><strong>Dante's Inferno is all about this idea of hell being in nine stages. That also feeds into this aspect of religion which is quite violent and oppressive.</strong></p>\n<p>It is. The religions we are exposed to - they are all, to a certain extent violent. You have to renounce to something to be part of that religion. You have to renounce a big part of humankind to be part of it.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I wouldn’t call myself an atheist, but I struggle with the idea of defining myself as religious, even though I really love to read the gospels, and I do, maybe not everyday, but most days.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/131671548&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>You've released with PAN a number of times, and worked on a split cassette with Bill Kouligas too. How did the two of you first meet?</strong></p>\n<p>We were both living in Berlin, he had just started the label. In the very beginning I sent him the record I made with Thomas Ankersmit, <em>Forma II</em>, with the possibility that Bill would release it on his label. He really liked it and in the meantime we became friends. Now I think of Bill as my friend rather than my label contact. Whenever I do another record and he would like to release it, good. But if not, we’re still going to go and eat somewhere together soon!</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think of the rest of the output on PAN? In some ways they've become known for this kind of trance-y style and I was wondering how connected you are with that kind of culture.</strong></p>\n<p>Some of it I like, some of it I don’t. I guess that the very first records on PAN in these kind of genres are Lee Gamble’s ones. Those for instance, I like. I think it has a deepness in the sound - it has this kind of MDMA quality to it, it feels like the music is sweating MDMA itself.  Lee Gamble’s music resonates with me, and with experiences of my past, and present alike.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/273009162&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>How did you become involved in 3/4HadBeenEliminated and how has the experience informed your solo work?</strong></p>\n<p>We all live in different cities since a long time so it’s very hard to get us all together to make a new record. It’s very slow and kind of an annoying process to work together in this way where we have to send lots of parts by file-sharing. This kind of we-transfer composition process ultimately sucks. It’s on my mind that we should find a week to sit together in the same room with instruments and record a lot, then take it from there.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally, what's next for yourself? Any further projects coming up?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m working as usual on new pieces but I don’t have anything to say about them as I don’t know what they are yet!</p>\n<p>Do you know Pan Daijing? I’m doing something with Werner Dafeldecker and her. It’s called The Speaker and it’s going to be a live performance with multiple channels - three to eight depending on the size of the room. Mostly, electronics (me and Werner) and spoken words (Pan). It’s going to be a live performance and a radio thing. The first gig is going to be in Berlin in September, it’s not finished but I like it already.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/264618306&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Judit Bagi.</em></p>\n<p>Promoters Towards Collapse have a dropbox folder expressly used for archiving images of fly-tipping around London. This has been craftily synced with their Facebook stream, meaning their account is littered (no-pun intended) with pictures of knackered old fridges, tellys and mattresses left on street corners and residential estates.</p>\n<p>This should give you some sense of the characters behind Towards Collapse -  using their considerable technological nous for projects largely related to bins, shredders and waste processing plants. The last gig of theirs I went to, titled <em>Luxury Flats for Luxury Twats</em>, saw founding members Robin and Alex team up with Combat Recordings' Stormfield, to construct a visual show entirely using recycled footage from trendy Shoreditch new builds, soundtracked by crushing power-electronics and distortion-drenched hip-hop.</p>\n<p>The common theme amongst all the in-jokes and tomfoolery however is Robin and Alex's stabs at the relentless churn of London living. In their own words, the night began after &quot;lengthy conversations about encroaching waves of gentrification, the decadence of London's litter-strewn streets, the everyday excess of post-consumerism and the vapid attitudes of luxury twats in their ivory towers.&quot;</p>\n<p>Continuing, the duo explain how: &quot;the Brothers Binn poured all this into a shared love of gloomy music that goes clang in the night, attempting to heal the wounds inflicted by the churning mill of late capitalism. Bringing onboard graphic designer Bonnie Baker, the Towards Collapse collective was formed.&quot;</p>\n<p>Over the three or four events they have hosted, Towards Collapse have moved around North East London like a couple of deranged property surveyors looking for the latest on-trend catchment area. They teamed up with Open Jack Sessions at New River Studios last year, and took up residence in the sadly now defunct Power Lunches in Dalston before that.</p>\n<p>Their latest event sees Towards Collapse return to Dalston, this time setting up shop in basement venue, VFD on Friday. Providing the soundtrack to your Government approved breakdown, two Berlin-based artists, Swarm Intelligence and Dead Fader will be in attendance, alongside Voyder affiliates VORRS and Nolan Dialta.</p>\n<h3>Tracklist</h3>\n<p>Brian Gascoigne - Phase I [Waxwork US] <br>\nWitxes - Through Abraxas I [Denovali Records] <br>\nThe Haxan Cloak - Mara [Tri Angle] <br>\nBobby Krlic - Pharmacies [Sacred Bones Records] <br>\nReload - Rota Link [Infonet] <br>\nPhonat &amp; Holly - Connection Lost [Trekkie Trax] <br>\nSekt - Nihilism [Unknown] <br>\nMick Gordon - Lazarus Waves [Doom Soundtrack] <br>\nMetalogue feat.

    "content": "<p>Hisolat records present <em>Threshold</em>, the debut 12” from Matthias Puech. Puech’s work has a curious genealogy. The sounds that you hear are from own-made modular synthesisers. Homemade electronics are of course nothing new, from Aphex Twin’s recoded ZX81 to demented circuit-bent Furbys. As long as engineers have designed hardware, musicians have twisted them into instruments. Puech himself works by programming chips and interfaces for modular synthesisers: rewiring machines to rewire the brain.</p>\n<p>This concept of ‘engineering’ also features as the theme for much of the music. If these sounds are ‘about’ anything, then they are about the elegance of mathematics; the strangeness of numbers. This ought to be unsurprising, since Puech himself works as a research scientist by day. Yet <em>Threshold</em> displays a sonic world that is neither steely nor robotic. These sounds are living, breathing and growing. Listen, for example, to the churn of bustling insects on ‘The Moth Song’, the earthy squelches of ‘Make or Break’, or the call-and-response bird song of ‘Biome’.</p>\n<p>The world that <em>Threshold</em> presents is one where the natural and artificial are symbiotic. It is a place not dissimilar to the one imagined by Richard Brautigan in his 1967 prose on a technological utopia: <em>“...a cybernetic meadow where mammals and computers live together in mutually programming harmony</em> […] <em>a cybernetic forest filled with pines and electronics where deer stroll peacefully past computers as if they were flowers with spinning blossoms...”</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/300312678&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>I've seen Peder Mannerfelt play a number of times, but Corsica Studios at the start of February was the first time I've seen him DJ. Needless to say it's a very different experience from the hallucinatory electronics he delivers at his live shows, as he pieced together a set of hard-hitting 4/4; phasing synth-lines and jarring vocal hooks ensuring things remained suitably surreal.</p>\n<p>Whether this set marks a shift to a more straight-forward brand of club music in Mannerfelt's operations more generally I'm not sure, yet the latest release from his label, Peder Mannerfelt Produktion, would at least seem to reflect this contrast.</p>\n<p>Titled with much the same directness the music itself possesses, 'PM V/A Vol.1' is a four track collaboration between Mannerfelt, Andre Kronert, Boston-based Isabella and Drömfakulteten member Sissel Wincent. Opening with Isabella's 'Ominate', the release starts as it means to continue. Discordant air-raid samples and buoyant low-end make for a driving, hypnotic listen, with what sounds like outtakes from Pink Floyd's 'Money' providing off-kilter percussive frills.</p>\n<p>Kronert and Mannerfelt continue in a similar vein with the ghetto-house leaning 'Tenth Street Rag' and tumbling 'Wake UP!', while Sissel Wincent elects to challenge the mold. Her 'Illusion of Randomness' EP was a highlight of last year, providing a refreshingly personal feeling take on modular electronics. Across 'Tricky Question Why' Wincent maintains the reductionist sound palette of her previous release, but notches up the BPM a good few scores, creating a pulse-raising, dizzying cacophony of kick drums.</p>\n<p>Lately we've tended to steer away from the more overtly functional side of electronic music. This isn't necessarily because we dislike, or don't see the need for this kind of music, but often it feels like there's limited use in  trying to analyse something which is better assessed by the amount of sweat it generates on the dancefloor.</p>\n<p>'PM V/A Vol.1' feels different however. While remaining club-based, each offering accentuates themes which have been present through much of the label's previous output; dopplereffect synthesisers zooming across the stereo field, malfunctioned breakdowns and vocal hooks which worm their way into your ear and stay there.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/298892594&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Haunter Records have always had a no-nonsense feel to them. Fronted by Daniele Guerrini and Francesco Birsa Alessandri, the label seems to take every release as it comes. This is evident both from the formats they release on, jumping between cassettes, vinyls and CDs, and the styles they choose to host. Across their four year life span, Haunter have released everything from the warped lo-fi experiments of Somec through to the pummeling dungeon techno of Cage Suburbia's 'Argument' series.</p>\n<p>Their shifting aesthetic is also a good example of this refusal to settle; the third of the aforementioned 'Argument' series features an <a href=\"https://haunterrecords.bandcamp.com/album/argument-03\">insert</a> which looks like a flyer you might find at an anarchist rally, while the sleeve for Weightausend's 'Meet Your Doom!' could make up an imaginary clan crest for a sci-fi strategy game.</p>\n<p>The latest of their output is no different; this week Haunter released two 7&quot;s in sync (sadly they don't come with the amazing two slogan-darbed football scarves mocked up on the Haunter Bandcamp <a href=\"https://haunterrecords.bandcamp.com/album/petit-singe-kind-a\">profiles</a>). The first is Weightausend's amphetamine-charged snare-orchestra, <a href=\"https://haunterrecords.bandcamp.com/album/weightausend-went-berserk\">'Went Berserk'</a>, while the second is the thunderous 'KIND A' from Italian artist Hazina Francia, aka Petit Singe. Despite having a rather impressive catalogue of gigs on her resume, even playing Boiler Room Milan last year, Francia has only released one EP previously, the spindly, hollow-cheeked 'Tregua' cassette.</p>\n<p>In comparison, 'KIND A' is a noisey, invasive affair. The title track shunts forward with broken-beat percussive assaults and snarling stabs of low-end. The track is interspersed with cinematic samples of a group timidly conversing with a booming robotic voice, until the inevitable &quot;program malfunction&quot; is declared, and the track descends into chaos. 'Thrillseeka' on the other hand sends electro-magnetic shockwaves across the dancefloor, stumbling drum tones and sharp buzzes of glitch acting like a vacuum, absorbing everything in their path.  The results are almost reminiscent of something you might find on Night Slugs, albeit drenched in heady, cinematic reverbs.</p>\n<p>The accompanying text to Francia's 'KIND A' states that this release provides a &quot;sign of what’s to come in the very near future&quot; - an exciting proposition given the impressive development between this release and her last. Whether this forthcoming material will be released via Haunter is unclear at this stage, but they've certainly found a good fit. Her sound possesses both a directness and a willingness to experiment, in a way which compliments much of the Haunter output.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/305407605&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Releasing your debut material in-tandem with modular titan Russell Haswell isn't bad going for a first footing. Such was the story in 2013, when Gábor Lázár occupied the a-side of the 'Split' cassette, filling it with wild, jazz-imbued oscillations. For those unfamiliar with Lázár's sound, it can seem a startlingly unconventional approach, and also somewhat difficult to describe. The is heightened by the fact all his material to date (bar his collaborative LP with Mark Fell) uses the same spartan tonal palette, putting his idiosyncratic use of additive synthesis in unwavering central focus.</p>\n<p>My own first introduction was last year at Norbergfestival. Through a thick veil of blue smoke Lázár barraged the audience with frenetic modulations, dizzying and untamed, yet with an ultra-clean, almost trance-like sheen to them at the same time. Heard in isolation I would usually envisage this style of music played in small DIY spaces, with the audience sat cross-legged on the floor and lost in thought. Yet behind the highly-engineered sound, Lázár brings an exuberance and groove impossible not to move to.</p>\n<p>With his latest LP, <em>Crisis Of Representation</em> released via French label Shelter Press late last month, we decided to catch up with Lázár to talk about the album, Stockholm's 'Elektronmusikstudion' (EMS) and introducing Lángos to Mark Fell.</p>\n<p><strong>I enjoyed your performance at Norbergfestival last year. From what I could tell you were just using a laptop - is this characteristic of how you make music in the studio too?</strong></p>\n<p>Norbergfestival was great. My favourite acts were DJ Stingray, Mobilegirl and Apeiron Crew. During the festival we went to swim in a huge cold lake with Mobilegirl and Pan Daijing. It's just a 10-15 walk from the festival site so it was the perfect way to escape a bit. The water is definitely cold for anyone who is not from Sweden. At least for me it was...</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2143/32464833550_9753fa3e6b_b.jpg\" alt=\"norberg\"></p>\n<p><em>Gábor Lázár live at Norbergfestival 2016.</em></p>\n<p>I use software at the moment but I can imagine using modular synths for other projects. When I make a track I first create the rhythm and then I play around with the synth and record it in real-time. On stage I use the same synth presets which I specifically designed for the last album and I'm playing around with it, so it's real-time sound synthesis in all cases.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3922/32692265182_2cd71ee7e7_b.jpg\" alt=\"sr\"></p>\n<p><em>With DJ Stingray at Norbergfestival 2016.</em></p>\n<p><strong>I saw you spent some time at EMS in Stockholm too. How long were you there and have you done more sessions since?</strong></p>\n<p>I was there in December 2014. Lorenzo Senni also had a residency on the same dates at EMS; both of us stayed a week. He worked with the Buchla, I had the Serge. It was a good experience. I managed to realise my ideas quite quickly on the synths I think. I made recordings at EMS but only for my own archive, not to release.</p>\n<p>The residency space is really nice, and the people who run EMS are super friendly. It would be great to go back again.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/172275925&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>So far, your releases have all followed a similar blueprint using additive synthesis. When did you first discover this process and what is it that keeps you using this fairly limited tonal palette?</strong></p>\n<p>I think it isn't so important what synthesis I'm using. The results and the development over the years are much more important I think. I don't feel myself limited, I can see loads of possibilities ahead of me but it's better to do one thing at one time.</p>\n<p><strong>I've been enjoying <em>Crisis of Representation</em>. How did you arrive at the album's title? What was your first contact with Felicia and Bartolomé too?</strong></p>\n<p>I was reading about hyper-reality when I encountered this phrase. I liked that it has multiple meanings so picked it as a title...</p>\n<p>Bartolomé from Shelter Press contacted me and told me that they would be happy to work with me. I've been following their work since Kaugummi Books, so I knew what they do.</p>\n<p><strong>I wanted to ask a bit about your release with Mark Fell too. He came and worked with you in your studio for a few days right? What was it about the collaboration that worked so well you think?</strong></p>\n<p>We didn't really talk about what we wanted to do. The studio was at my friends' apartment; it was central. I brought a pair of speakers and we set up our own computers, connected them and made recordings across four days. After, we selected the ones we liked the most, then later we cut them down. So all of the tracks are real-time recordings with a little bit of post-editing.</p>\n<p>I like to make music with not too much talk and that's what Mark also prefers, so it was comfortable and we still had a lot of time to hang out in the city.</p>\n<p>Since then, he came back again for a week and every time he is in Budapest we go out to eat Lángos at least once. It's an original Hungarian dish - deep fried dough, quite heavy... When I first described how Lángos is made Mark was a total skeptic but after the first bite he just said, &quot;oh my god&quot;, and ate the whole Lángos at once.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/750/32795059320_30525c3d39_b.jpg\" alt=\"laz\"></p>\n<p><em>With Mark Fell at ZKM in Karlsruhe, May 2016.</em></p>\n<p>For the dough you need 300g all-purpose flour, 7g dried (instant) yeast, 250ml water, ½ tsp salt, sunflower oil (for frying) and for toppings: sour cream, grated cheese, garlic, salt.

What kinds of things were you listening to growing up?</strong> <br> <br>\n\b\nI listened to everything I could with my friends. We wanted to discover music; we listened to everything from Mayhem, to Jeff Mills to DJ Hellfish to [Ryoji] Ikeda, to Pan Sonic... all kinds of stuff. The most primitive and the most sophisticated. I think techno stands in the middle - it's both primitive and sophisticated at the same time and that's why I became obsessed with it I think. I spent my late teens/early twenties making techno and DJing which I still really like doing.</p>\n<p><strong>Does the political situation in Hungary have any bearing on the country's electronic music scene? Has the current government affected clubbing circles for example, or are you seeing any instances of more overtly political electronic music in Hungary?</strong></p>\n<p>I don't run clubs so I don't know if there is any kind of manipulation by politics, but I know that there is no financial support for non-profit cultural festival organisers such as UH Fest. But, they still make it happen through hard work and collaborations with supportive club owners and other venues.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/89988223&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>You played UH Fest last year right? Are the crowd mostly Hungarian or does the festival attract a lot of visitors from abroad? On a related note, do you get many bookings in Hungary generally?</strong></p>\n<p>I really like to play in Budapest because roughly the half of the audience are my friends or people I know from somewhere, so it's more intimate. This year I noticed that there were more foreign visitors than last year and I think this trend will keep growing. They are mostly people from the surrounding countries taking a bus or train, getting here cheap to see big names playing and also local acts for reasonable price. Sounds like a good holiday!  <br> <br>\n\b\nI played at UH Fest in 2014 and 2016 and at 4DSOUND in 2015 and 2016. I think this is totally enough of playing live here in Budapest, sometimes I DJ with friends but that's also kind of rare. The scene is good.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally what's next for yourself? Any further releases on the horizon?</strong></p>\n<p>Sure, I will take new directions with the next release. You can even dance to it.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/302497177&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p>The stated purpose of the ‘Cities and Memory’ project is to explore, “The relationships between sound and memory, and between places and their sounds”. Last year, we wrote about their <a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/articles/cities-and-memory-dada-100-years-on\">‘Dada sounds’ collection</a>, celebrating the centenary of Cabaret Voltaire’s opening, and thus the beginning of the Dada movement. Here, contributors “remixed the world,&quot; applying Dadaist cut-up techniques to field-recordings, forming a global interactive map. You could hear Dada interpretations of a Canadian football stadium, a Thailand airport, or the street outside Cabaret Voltaire itself.</p>\n<p>Their latest collection, ‘Sacred Spaces’, examines “the crucial role sound has played in our spiritual and religious lives,” exploring the “sonic similarities between different religions, and different types of sacred space from across the world”. But what do these spaces have in common? A recurrent theme in places of worship is the sense of relative scale. Reverb and space are often manipulated to extremities. Think, for example, of Bach’s rich organ Masses echoing off the walls of Leipzig’s Thomaskirche. Or the seductive simplicity of a Tibetan gong, embodying the sonic philosophy that influenced the meditative drones of Eliane Radigue and many others. The spatial character of religious places take on a metaphorical meaning from the infinitely large to the infinitely small.</p>\n<p>Religious acoustics also carry <em>purpose</em>. They are made and reproduced to facilitate a state of mind, one which elevates the pious and diminishes the trivial. In these places, life and death take precedence in one’s mind, if only for a short while. But not all religious music is sombre or serious. Take the joyous rupture of Hare Krisha or Gospel music. There is a lively ecstasy that can be accessed through religious song and dance, which can be traced all the way into the hedonistic excesses of modern nightclubs. Even Robert Hood, founding member of electronic pioneering collective Underground Resistance, has professed to “delivering God's message through techno”.</p>\n<p>Then there’s the alliances between the senses and spirituality. Vision gives a sense of distance; of things at a distance; of oneself against others. Eyes over-exaggerate this separation between oneself and an other, outer world. You’re here; it’s over there. But sound is imbued with memory and narrative depth. When listening to a space, it unfolds over time. Where vision gives simultaneity; sound gives sequence. This connection to temporarily gives music a special precedence in memory. So it makes sense for the ‘Cities and Memory’ project to take sound as its focus. Sound is, as Beethoven put it, “the mediator between the life of the senses and the life of the spirit.” Imagine a similar project in which contributors merely submitted photographs of religious places. What would be the point? The sense of the spiritual must be heard, not seen.</p>\n<p>To pinpoint that which makes a space ‘religious’ or unique is largely a redundant exercise. ‘Sacred spaces’ is a broad church. Time would be better spent away from definitions and in the places themselves. This collection comprises field recordings from 48 sources, spanning 34 counties, making it the biggest in the project’s history. Artists processed these recordings to reimagine and recontextualise their sacred sources. Within the archive, you can find the church bells of Northern Italy, Turkish call to prayer and the bells of Burma. Find out more about the project and their religious archive <a href=\"http://citiesandmemory.com/sacredspaces/\">here</a>. And below, find a curated playlist of these ‘Sacred Spaces’ from Stuart Fowkes, creative director of Cities and Memory.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0072-cities-and-memory%2F&hide_cover=1&light=1\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>I think the first time I really understood the work of Christina Nemec, aka Chra fully was at Berlin Atonal in 2015. Her sound is built to fill chasms, and the cool, echoing concrete chambers of Mitte's Kraftwerk provided the ideal setting to experience it.</p>\n<p>Her latest release, the JSMË dispensed 'A Wounded Deer' cassette has captured the feeling I had at that performance perfectly; yes, there is a dark, foreboding quality to the music, yet it is also about letting it wash over you. If you are willing to submit, the experience can be meditative and oddly calming.</p>\n<p>From my discussions with Nemec, it would appear her first forays into the world of making music were playing bass in post-punk and new-wave bands in the '70s and '80s, but always with one eye on what was happening in the burgeoning world of electronic music.</p>\n<p>Understanding this feels somewhat important when confronted with her most recent release; the ever-present amplifier buzz, and distortion caked swells strongly evokes this world. 'Lost' for example centers around a riff which could have been recorded during a Shadows jam session, although slowed to micro-speed and shrouded in creaking, nightmarish drones.</p>\n<p>There is a density to Nemec's sound which contributes to the hypnotic, dream-like quality her releases seem to have. 'A Wounded Deer Leaps The Highest' layers cloudy discordant textures across its duration. This is music for the witching hour; clattering industrial hits, vaporous low-end, and jangling strings evoke the most abstract of Lovecraftian hallucinations.</p>\n<p>The itching granular modulations of 'Fire In The Frozen Lake' make another good example. Aqueous drones and shuddering stop-start crescendos work to a grinding close. Unexpectedly clean bleeps sometimes break free from the mist, as if stirring from a dream.</p>\n<p>Over the years Nemec has taken many different approaches. There were the post-punk days mentioned earlier, her involvement in Blackest Ever Black band Shampoo Boy alongside Peter Rehberg and Christian Schachinger, as well as more glitch and dance focused Chra releases for labels like Editions Mego and the label she runs Comfortzone. 'A Wounded Deer' presents a good snapshot of where Nemec is at right now, and where her sound might carry her in the future.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/295636035&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "date": "2017-03-10T00:00:00.000Z",
    "content": "<p>The Stockholm-based composer Ellen Arkbro has recently recently written music that spans several decades and coordinates of the globe. Following the work of micro-tuning maestro La Monte Young, Arkbro has employed a unique tuning known as <em>meantone temperament</em>. You can find this tuning in pieces of 20th Century avant-garde obscurity, such as György Ligeti’s <em>Passacaglia Ungherese</em>, a piece that is literally impossible to play for its intended instrument. But meantone is also found within the Sherer-Orgel, a pipe-organ dating back to 1624 in St. Stephen’s Church in Tangermünde, in Northeastern Germany. It is this instrument which features as the centrepiece of Arkbro’s new album, <em>For Organ &amp; Brass</em>.</p>\n<p>Despite its seeming obscurity, meantone temperament can also be found, strangely enough, in that most universal of genres: blues. “Hidden within the harmonic framework of the Renaissance organ are intervals and chords that bare a close resemblance to those found in the modalities of traditional blues music,” explains Arkbro. “The work can be thought of as a very slow and reduced blues music.” When this occurs, music becomes metaphorical: one genus for another. It decouples the instrument from its historical and traditional constraints, opening up possibilities for future intepretation.</p>\n<p>A few examples like this immediately spring to mind. Think of Animal Collective's 'Visiting Friends', an epic attempt to write a piece of ambient music with acoustic guitars, aping the wall-of-hums style of Wolfgang Voigt's 'Gas' project. Steve Reich is notorious for this kind of move. David Bowie once (inappropriately?) described Reich's <em>Music for 18 Musicians</em> as, &quot;Balinese gamelan music cross-dressing as minimalism&quot;. And in 2012, Reich composed <em>Radio Rewrite</em>,  a piece of minimalist orchestral music following the contours of a Radiohead chord progression.</p>\n<p>But one curious thing about Blues is that it doesn't seem to suit its intended purpose. Where drone, glitch and noise do exactly as they say on the tin, blues expresses anything but 'the blues'. Putting the issue of 'blue notes' to one side, Blues as a genre is intended to uplift. They carry songs full of spirit and hope. As B.B King once said, &quot;Blues is a tonic for whatever ails you. I could play the blues and then not be blue anymore.&quot; In this sense, <em>For Organ &amp; Brass</em> really isn't a piece of blues music. If this record is some kind of tonic, then the ailment must have been gruesome. The whole record sounds like a doom horn, an alarm signalling an oncoming conflict, or the curtain call of a bloody battle. Like Jed Kurzel's score for the 2015 <em>Macbeth</em> adaptation, it is as broad and open as the Scottish highlands, but thick with fog and filthy air.</p>\n<p><em>For Organ &amp; Brass</em> will be out April 14th on <a href=\"http://subtextrecordings.net/\">Subtext Recordings.</a></p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/212574295?byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>&quot;Individual instances of subjective, conscious experience&quot; reads the Wiki definition of qualia. In Latin, the term translates as something like &quot;what sort&quot; or &quot;of what kind&quot;, tying into the idea that we could all have different experiences of what we refer to as the same thing. For example, what you perceive as blue, might be the same as what I experience as red even though we refer to them with the same language. Pop-philosophy aside, the latest release from Jonathan Baruc, aka 'Death Qualia' plays on themes we can probably all recognise as related to the eternal abyss.</p>\n<p>The 'Intention Versus' 12&quot; sees it's release on Berlin-based Portals Editions, a label run by Yair Elazar Glotman, Marijn Degenaar and Brandon Rosenbluth. Since their debut offering in 2014, Portals Editions have straddled the line between razor-blade techno, tectonic drone and doom metal. Little wonder is it then that Baruc finds such a good fit on the label, turning in a release which meets these criteria with deft ability.</p>\n<p>The record clangs and scrapes forth, skin-crawling resonances and grinding thrusts of low-end. Moments of outright horror characterised by bone-shattering percussion, tension-doused harmonics and pressure-blasted ambience are offset by timid, headtorch-lit explorations into the unknown, endless chasms appearing every other footstep.</p>\n<p>In advance of the record's release on March 17, we are very pleased to be able to share a premiere of the opening track, 'Circe Offering The Cup To Ulysses'.

    "content": "<p>When I interviewed Herve Atsè Corti aka Herva last year, he told me his studio was &quot;like a spaceship now&quot;. By the sounds of his latest album, the Planet Mu released <em>Hyper Flux</em>, this was no exaggeration. <em>Hyper Flux</em> is the result of more than an assortment of synthesisers and sequencers set to auto-pilot. In the accompanying text, Corti discusses his Father's background as an instrument inventor, and how he used those as well as conventional drums and guitars to piece the album together.</p>\n<p>In the simplest terms, <em>Hyper Flux</em> is an album of great depth and ingenuity. My first thought on listening to the lead tracks was how evocative it is of Warp's hay-day, releasing work by acts like Aphex Twin, Autechre and Boards of Canada. Take the frenzied two-step of LP forerunner, 'Solar Xub' for example, or the rough-and-ready reversed fills on 'Peach'. 'Rule The Sun' combines drifting, Boards of Canada style melodies with twinkling off-beat rhythms, while 'Jitter' deploys itching hats, deranged melodics and squelching bleeps to psychedelic effect.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of artists out there who become fixated on these kind of sounds, and some even get quite close to replicating them. What is usually overlooked in the process however, is  the music behind the composition. This is perhaps what makes Corti such a standout; rhythm and composition seem to come effortlessly, it's more a question of how he chooses to package them.</p>\n<p>Yes, it has its Warp reminiscent moments, but there is far more worthy of note here; the breadth of influences Corti has managed to incorporate is actually rather staggering. Opener 'Esotic Energy' could make up the opening skit to a Dimlite LP, heady arps and xylophone hits creating an intoxicating backdrop between drags of static, while 'Lly Spirals' calls Drexciya to mind with shuffled electro-surges and heavily sedated G funk synth-lines. Then there is 'Nasty MF'. The track does much what it says on the tin - taking its queues from Workshop style house-abstractions, dirt-caked kick drums thudding between cascading synth-lines and swollen bass hits.</p>\n<p>As is noted in the press materials, <em>Hyper Flux</em> can seem a somewhat messy listen at first. If anything it feels as if Corti is beset by too many ideas rather than too few; something beautifully refreshing in a world where much electronic music takes repetition to excess. Appreciating it properly does take time, but then again all the best things do.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/297725818&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

This year this includes Mikro Chrimatistirio, the city's 19th century built Stock Exchange Market which was in operation between 1891 and 1926, and The Garden of The Association of Greek Archaeologists.</p>\n<p>As well as opening up some amazing locations, Fasma have developed a knack for curating lineups which transcend genres, creating an experience which feels simultaneously niche incredibly wide-ranging stylistically. Maybe this is to be expected, as after all, 'Fasma' is the Greek word for spectrum, in their own words meaning: &quot;a condition that can be limited to a specific set of values but can also vary infinitely within a continuum&quot;.</p>\n<p>This year for example sees the power-ambient of Alessandro Cortini share the same billing as Toxe's energy-flash trance, and alternative-rap pinup Zebra Katz. There's also appearances from techno's answer to DJ Screw, Low Jack, Killekill's Alienata and several emerging local talents such as Vanila's ANFS, or the debut of Constantine's HADES project.</p>\n<p>As usual, Fasma will also host a series of lectures and workshops.

Talking you through the latter of these, Conditional Records head Calum Gunn will be in session on April 5 discussing it's use in the live coding environment. Later in the calendar, TidalCycles designer Alex Mclean aka Yaxu will also be speaking.</p>\n<p>Other dates of particular interest include May 3, when Shelly Knotts will be running a session on 'Making Music With Code' with open-source audio engine and programming language, Supercollider. On April 22, Tom Richards, whose take on Daphne Oram's 'Mini-Oramics' machine I was lucky enough to see in action at Fort Process last year, will be leading a beginners workshop on the foundations of electronics and synthesis. Over the weekend participants will build a basic synthesiser from scratch, learning how to solder and prototype simple circuits before taking their creations home at the end of the session.</p>\n<p>On June 26 there will also be a talk from our repetition-obsessed friends at <a href=\"http://www.sm-ll.com\" target=\"_blank\">SM-LL</a>, Martin J Thompson and Lucia H Chung, discussing their approach to production, label management and event curation.</p>\n<p>To see the full programme so far, click <a href=\"http://musichackspace.org/whatson/\">here</a>.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O_DsABJzvUY?rel=0&controls=0&showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n",

Although better known behind the decks than as a producer, it would be a mistake to brush off this latter aspect of her work.

Her DJ sets carry an uncooperative character to them. The rhythms are often wrong-footing; the textures brazenly harsh.

    "content": "<p>You might know London-based Jimmy Billingham better as HOLOVR (or for his other Holo-related activities). His 2014 LP for Opal Tapes, <em>Holo Earth</em>, straddled something between the forest-hallucinogens of Oneohtrix Point Never and the foggy rave-pastiche of someone like Lee Gamble or Lowtec. 8-bit kicks, swirling arpeggios and warped breakbeats collided to create a dream-like experience - euphoric techno lost at sea, dizzy and confused.</p>\n<p>Recently however, Billingham has been exploring other avenues. Most recently he contributed to SM-LL's 'Batch' series under the moniker Ex Geo. 'Batch 0005' takes the form of a lathe-cut 12&quot; presenting a more streamlined and delicate approach to production than his usual space-gazing material. Melodic motifs are left to stand on their own here, as Billingham reduces his tonal palette down to the bare essentials.</p>\n<p>With the release out for a week or so, we decided to ask Billingham about how the project differs from his work as HOLOVR, making chiptune on Gameboys and the benefits of listening to music in the dark.</p>\n<p><strong>First off, tell us a bit about the Ex Geo project and how it came to be. What would be the best way summarise the differences between Ex Geo and HOLOVR?</strong></p>\n<p>Ex Geo is less melody-driven and steady than HOLOVR, and more abrasive/abstract/glitchy.  It's a platform to try out that kind of stuff.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/301860739&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>There were a few Ex Geo releases on Indole in 2015 - the latest is out on SM-LL. What was your first contact with Martin and Lucia and how did the release come together?</strong></p>\n<p>I recorded most of the tracks that ended up on the release over a very short period and actually sent them to Yves De Mey, just for him to listen.  He recommended I send them to Martin and Lucia as he felt it'd fit what they were doing with SM-LL.</p>\n<p>I looked them up and realised that it certainly did, especially with their stripped-back, minimal, low-key aesthetic, as well as Martin's own extensive use of Nord Modular gear (the Ex Geo release is exclusively Nord Micro Modular, apart from effects).  It really did seem a perfect fit, and had some similarities with stuff they'd already released on the label.  I sent the tracks to them and they were really into them, and here we are now!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3948/33367501890_0d10399bd5_z.jpg\" alt=\"a\"></p>\n<p><em>SM-LL's 'Batch' series.</em></p>\n<p><strong>I know Martin was something of a persuading factor in Yves buying a Nord Modular - I was wondering how you first came across the tool and ended up getting one? Is it a very different way of working to how you develop HOLOVR material?</strong></p>\n<p>I've had a Nord Modular for about 3-4 years. I recently upgraded from the Micro to the Rack version.  I can't remember how I first came across it but what appealed to me was the combination of huge scope and flexibility combined with a small footprint and low cost. Nords have quite a distinctive sound, which I love.</p>\n<p>I've used the Nord Modular in HOLOVR stuff but in a different way - mainly for percussion and some sequences.  With that Ex Geo release on SM-LL I wanted to explore the sound design elements of it and push it in a different direction.  It naturally has a very clean, digital sound - which is part of its charm - but I wanted to get it to sound organic; I was thinking of sounds of water, wind and tactile, textural sounds.  Running it through a spring reverb unit and analogue delay certainly helped with that.</p>\n<p><strong>The press materials cite 'Batch 0005' as a &quot;palette cleanser&quot; between working on HOLOVR material. Is it important for you to have variation in your output to be able to approach things fresh?</strong></p>\n<p>I guess so, although I'm not sure I really think of it like that.  I just wanted to make something like those Ex Geo tracks at that point, something stripped back, texture-driven and organic sounding, with a certain harshness, and it did feel like a palette-cleanser (that was my phrase actually!).   I just go with whatever vibe I'm feeling at the time.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/148054550&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>What were your first experiences of live electronic music like and what do you try to achieve in your own live shows? Does aesthetic/gear matter or is it just about the resulting sounds?</strong></p>\n<p>All that matters is the sound and the vibe.  I like it to be as dark as possible, so people can get lost in the music and so I can too, and just get really deep and as close to an altered state as possible.</p>\n<p>That's what I like about club spaces - they're zones for people to just vibe in, rather than it being about a performance as such. For me, the sound is the only thing performing, and darkness means people don't feel the need to physically orientate themselves towards anything (apart from the speakers). With music in darkness it becomes possible to even orientate people away from their physical presence, and the experience of sound and music becomes much richer.  The epitome of this for me was the Autechre show at the Royal Festival Hall in complete darkness last year; such a strong, precise sound in such a vast space - one of the best things I've ever experienced.</p>\n<p><strong>I read you used to make chiptune on a rewired Gameboy... How did you get into this? Do you think it provided a good first footing for working with modulars and hardware?</strong></p>\n<p>It wasn't really rewired Gameboys - just using programs that enable you to control the sound engine.  I'm not sure how I got into it - I just liked the sound and being able to use old bits of equipment in ways that weren't intended.  It also fit the strict budget limitations I had at the time!  You're right though, it was my first real use of hardware, and although I did at first revel in the limitations, ultimately they became constrictive, so I moved on.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/310852026&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>You studied film right? I wanted to ask about your favourite soundtracks, and whether film-music feeds into your production process.</strong></p>\n<p>I studied film theory, yes (not film-making) - more the philosophical study of film.  Music in film is very important for me - it's essential for film to have its uniquely powerful effect, although I never really listen to soundtracks on their own; that always feels odd to me.  Film soundtracks I love include the Popul Vuh soundtrack for Aguirre, Wrath of God, the Vangelis Blade Runner soundtrack, and the music and sound in just about all of David Lynch's work.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2872/32909071594_dbc0849914_z.jpg\" alt=\"we\"></p>\n<p><strong>You run Indole as well. What were your original intentions starting the label, and how has the direction changed over the years? How much of the roster do you know on a personal level?</strong></p>\n<p>I got sent a demo before I'd started the label - one that I just had to put out.  It was the Pearl River Sound one, and that's definitely one of my favourites, although I really do love them all, hence them being on the label.  It was only ever about releasing music that I love, rather than thinking in terms of genre or appeal.  It's pretty much wound down now though. It's hard to devote time to it, as I prioritise my own music-making, and already have to balance that with a 9-5 job.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally what's next for yourself? Any forthcoming material you can tell us about?</strong></p>\n<p>A few HOLOVR records are on the way.  Next up is a 12&quot; on Happy Skull (which should be out in a couple of weeks), a Sad City remix on Emotional Response followed by a split as part of their Schleissen series, and then a couple that haven't been announced yet - it should be a good year!  I'll probably work on some more Ex Geo at some point too, once my palette needs a cleanse.</p>\n<p><em>'Batch 0005' is available via SM-LL's Bandcamp, <a href=\"https://sm-ll.bandcamp.com/album/ex-geo-batch-0005\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/310794250&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Christiana Rifaat</em></p>\n<p>When we last spoke to Derek Piotr, he was preparing the release of <em>Forest People Pop</em>, a record Piotr described as his &quot;shiny, complex pop record&quot;. But anyone expecting sing-a-longs and big drops is going to be disappointed. This is Pop done the Piotr way. The melodies are soapy and unfamiliar. They float around, orbiting an indiscernible chromatic structure. There are no hooks and no quick-fix resolutions to the discordant tensions.</p>\n<p>So what, if anything, makes this pop? The production is presented in sickly-sweet glossiness, like a sticky lollipop wrapper. So there's that. And the lyrics pour out with deceptive simplicity. &quot;I don't know what to do&quot; Piotr croons on its lead single, 'Light'. But his despair is not too sincere. <a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/interviews/forest-people-pop-derek-piotr\">Earlier this year</a>, Piotr disclosed that he believes &quot;words do not matter to music&quot;. For a record self-described as pop, and one that professes to be a 'radio edit', the music below could hardly be described as a unit shifter. One wonders what it sounded like before its radio-friendly rework. &quot;I sincerely think this shit is extremely commercial,&quot; Piotr once told me. &quot;My brain must really be twisted.&quot;</p>\n<p>'Light (Radio Edit)' will be available for download from <a href=\"http://www.bit-phalanx.com/\">bit-phalanx</a> on 14th April, 2017.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/316298876%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-7jgYM&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>In 1993, Mika Vainio sowed the seeds of change for electronic music. He first formed Pan Sonic together with Ilpo Väisänen and Sami Salo before Salo's departure three years later and over 20 years, the pair experimented with pushing the industrial noise styles of Throbbing Gristle, Einstürzende Neubauten and Suicide into the 21st Century. Rather than cacophonies of clattering metal and screams, the duo projected industrial sounds through twisted home-made synthesisers and effect units. At the height of their notoriety, the pair even collaborated with avant-garde legends Keiji Haino and Merzbow. 1993 was also the year Vainio set up the Sähkö imprint with Tommi Grönlund. Sähkö — Finnish for ‘electricity’ — became a label responsible for spearheading the return of minimalism in electronic music. At the time of rave, jungle and breakbeat, Sähkö kept the tempos and moods low. But his solo projects, most famously Ø and Philus, are his most influential. Following the sad passing of Vainio last week, we chose three of our favourite records to celebrate his legacy.</p>\n<p>###Ø - Metri</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JS0d06MW3sc?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\nIt’s unsurprising that some of Vainio’s strongest work came at the start of his career. Everything about the Ø project channelled an antithetical approach to music. Unlike the flashy DJ names of the 90s, Vainio’s seemingly unpronounceable moniker, signified... nothing. In mathematics, Ø represents an ‘empty set’, that is; a set containing no elements. In linguistics, it symbolises an unspoken element of speech, something left unsaid. Ironically, this speaks volumes about Vainio’s own aesthetic philosophy. Vainio elevates silence and space, and manipulates them as if they were their own musical instruments. Almost every aspect of this record has been surgically stripped of its fat. Take ‘Twin Bleeps’ or ‘Halli’, pieces so stark in composition that they sounds more like science experiments than music.\n<p>###Mika Vainio - Aíneen Musta Puhelin / Black Telephone Of Matter</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ROR0wBXPsl8?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\nVainio’s 4th solo album on UK imprint Touch deserves isolated listening. Vainio’s matchless agility with sound comes through in subtle silences and tone shifts that defy the volume reliance of noise as a genre. Split into seven haunting chapters, the album instead requires you to strain your ears to hear its sonic minutiae. The opening track, \"Roma A.D. 2727,\" introduces his dystopian post-industrial collage with a sub-bass that rumbles amidst sharp interruptions of white noise. The influence of the 20th Century Avant-Garde is evident in the musique concrète highlight; \"Silences Traversés Des Mondes Et Des Anges,\" with its thunderous backdrop of coastal rain and trill of birds flocking in the sky.\n<p>###Ø - Heijastuva</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gvsqUiIph00?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n_Heijastuva_ - ‘reflected’ in Finnish - introduced an unlikely feature into Vainio’s work: guitars. This is no mean feat, since guitars and ambient have often been bedfellows for the worst excesses of prog-wankery. Think of the sappy indulgences of David Gilmour or the early Manuel Göttsching. But _Heijastuva_ is different. Much like the rest of Vainio’s music, the sounds here are modest and understated. Simple refrains swell and merge together, taking you under their hypnotic spell through seductive simplicity. I once heard this album described as being like “swimming inside of your limbic system”, with all memory and moods floating around one another. Indeed, _Heijastuva_’s title track offers the perfect elegy for Vainio’s life, as nostalgic refrains ebb and flow like the passing of time. It’s a piece written to facilitate one thing: reflection. \n",

    "content": "<p>Vinyl-only label VENT are based in Eskisehir, Turkey, yet are otherwise a rather international affair. To date, they have hosted works from the likes of Croatian-artist Miss Sunshine, Sweden's Arbiter and a number of UK-based acts including Rebekah, DJ Skirt and Stephanie Sykes. The latest release from the imprint journeys to the other side of the Atlantic, for a contribution from Los Angeles-based modular-manipulator, Bana Haffar.</p>\n<p>When we first happened across VENT I would have told you they were a straight-shooting techno label, concerned with booming warehouse thumpers, inspiring ADE-style smoke-cannon climaxes. To surmise the label in this way today would be a disservice however, as VENT have started to look beyond the sometimes constrictive conventions of 4/4. Tolga Baklacıoğlu's <em>Peccum, Peccatum</em> for example could have found its home on (the now defunct) Avian sub-label Mira, bone-rattling amplifier crunch and burbling modulations creating an unsettling exploration into leftfield electronics.</p>\n<p>This latest release from Haffar might loosely be considered in the same vein, as it eschews conventional dancefloor patterns. Yet there is one big difference. Haffar's goal seems not to disturb or confront, but to create richly-textured dreamscapes both soothing, and easy to get lost in. 'Assimilaton' for example begins with guttural twitches of sub and hollow-toned pulses, distant vocals emerging and fading again through a mist of reverb. Sun-blushed arpeggios slowly emerge from fog, working into an introspective and meditative piece of electronica. 'Precipice' on the other hand free falls into the darkness, ominous doppler-effect drones and expansive bursts of melody keeping the listener suspended in flight.</p>\n<p>My favourite track on the release however is 'Shift', which calls to mind <em>Amber</em>-era Autechre slowed to micro-speed. Graceful melodics and whistling harmonies tumble forward, in a hazy voyage into the unknown.</p>\n<p>By the looks of her live sets, Haffar has more hardware than you can shake a patch cable at. Unlike many acts though, this doesn't equate to a messy or over-complicated output. What is particularly notable on her contribution to VENT, is how restrained, and tasteful her use of this gear is, putting her strongest ideas forward, and running with them without the need for unnecessary frills.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/318498308&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>There is a vigour and exuberance to the work of Julian Smith aka Don Froth difficult to find elsewhere. His work feels somewhat DIY, but not in the lo-fi, half-finished way of much of today's House music. A lot of the sounds he works with are self-recorded, and Smith isn't afraid of including the odd in-joke either. Discussing his most recent release, the 'D.O.C' EP for West Norwood Cassette Library, Smith reveals some of the origins of his sounds. &quot;The sample at the beginning of ‘A Broad Range’ was taken from an interview I did&quot; he starts. &quot;One of my usual fumbles, this time live on Italian radio. I sent it over to Bob [Bhamra of WNCL], had some laughs and we were off, there was the intro. Originally it was a one minute break but we had some chats on making it into a widescreen mix. I recorded the live drum breaks at a studio in Amsterdam (thanks Stef for linking that up).&quot;</p>\n<p>Under the Froth moniker, Smith has released on Phonica's in-house label Phonica White, UNO NYC and also his own Froth'n imprint. His work never seems quite so well housed as on Bhamra's WNCL however, which has hosted a number of his works. &quot;Bob and I got to chatting in 2009 via Doctor J and the Funky Fella Crew who ran a radio show out of Paris, Texas&quot; he begins when asked of their first meeting. &quot;Bob wanted to cut a dubplate of a track I had on J’s show called ‘Von’. We ended up meeting in London a year later at the Blue Posts pub, discovering we like the same draft beer. It’s been hard to leave ever since! I can’t express enough how much of a legend Bob is. Anyone I’ve met that knows Bob shares the same sentiment - he should be the president of music. Along with Daniel Wang.&quot;</p>\n<p>Brought up in San Diego, California, Smith has also spent time in the UK. &quot;Strict on manners, threatening headmasters, lotta lads, lots of competition&quot; is how he surmises spending the '80s in an all-boys boarding school. Heading back to San Diego in '92, Smith moved on to LA ten years later, spending time in various parts of the city.</p>\n<p>This included a spell living in Venice Beach, where Smith would find an unlikely source of artistic inspiration. After losing all his worldly possessions in a storage unit fire, Smith managed to turn a negative into a positive. He began working on the <em>Primitive Thoughts</em> LP in the aftermath releasing it under the name Jane In Palma late last year. &quot;Extra Space Storage. I should have known by that name I was getting into something low grade&quot; he begins when asked about the experience. &quot;Someone didn’t put their cigarette out properly and the entire building with hundreds of units, millions of dollars, and priceless memories went up in flames. At least that is what they told us. I believe it was an inside job to attempt to reclaim a very desirable piece of land a few blocks from the beach in Venice Beach. Whatever happened it didn’t work because after 24 hours of fire fighting they managed to salvage the building enough to not have to demo it.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;My buddy John called me saying my storage building was on fire. I went online in the middle of the night, watched the news helicopter cam survey the fire from above… I could see he was exactly right. My unit, with everything to my name was at the epicentre of the fire. Just like that, all gone. At that moment a switch clicked that changed my life for the better. I knew if I had the power to not let it affect me negatively, to appreciate what I had at that moment and not wish for more, in other words, hold tightly, let go lightly. So I did.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;During that time I started up the Jane project and recorded <em>Primitive Thoughts</em>. That was the best way for me to deal with it, and how the next one will be a continuation of that thought. That album was also part of some other works called ‘<a href=\"http://www.juliansmith.org/Croupier\">Croupier</a>’, which was a cathartic, visual expression of the experience.&quot;</p>\n<p>Recently, Smith headed back across the Atlantic, taking up residence on a small European island. From the sounds of it, the move has helped alleviate some of the downsides of urban habitation. &quot;After 12 years of living amongst 18 million people, I had had enough of the stresses of the unreasonably paced lifestyle of Southern California&quot; he explains. &quot;It will always be my home but I find it next to impossible to live slowly and simply. I made a change and moved to a small town on the south east side of an island with less than four thousand inhabitants where there is time to think and work critically. I really miss not seeing my family and friends as much but those are the decisions I have to live with.&quot;</p>\n<p>Still, he keeps some fond memories from his time in the US. Asked about his first exposure to club music, Smith gives little hesitation. &quot;San Diego. My friend Rob had an older brother who would drive us around in his lowered Honda Civic. Chain steering wheel. Air freshener hanging. This Civic was packed with subs, not sure how many but I remember the first time he picked us up. He didn’t say a word, just popped in a Miami bass test CD and waited. I kid you not I couldn’t breath, my eyes were rattling around, I was blind just trying to focus to get through it. I just remember him looking back at us with this grin, like, yeah boys you ain’t heard that before huh. No it was not a club but it might as well have been. Haven’t heard anything that hard since!&quot;</p>\n<p>His mix for us focusses on a slightly less visceral form of electronic music, but is powerful in its own way. &quot;I've been listening to more ambient / downbeat things again recently&quot; he starts when asked about the recording. &quot;I've also been making some versions and soundscapes of drone silence, the first track on the mix is one of them. That’s how this mix came through.&quot;</p>\n<p>You can stream the mix below, and make sure to keep an eye out for the next Jane In Palma LP, further releases on WNCL and a new project with friend and collaborator Bato Bato.</p>\n<h3>Tracklist</h3>\n<p>Jane - Change Fumble at Eroski [Unreleased] <br>\nJohnny Nash - A Shallow Space [Melody As Truth] <br>\nDeuter - Brazilian Love [KuckKuck] <br>\nHarold Budd -  Windows Charm [Cantil] <br>\nSynth Sisters - Silver Dust [17853 Records] <br>\nStavrogin - Lost in Systems [3BS Records] <br>\nRobert Reich - The Other Side Of Twilight [Dimension 16] <br>\nWolf Muller &amp; Cass - Glade Runner (Toulouse Low Trax Remix) [Internation Feel] <br>\nROTLA - Bosco [MND] <br>\nWoo -  Awaawaa [Palto Flats, New General Catalogue] <br>\nTwelve O’clock Shadow feat.

    "content": "<p><em>“The inspiration of Leopardi resonated for me around the idea that you have your finished work and then your process, your backdrop [...] your research - and all of his research is available, it’s free to view. And 'Zibaldone' in a way was me saying, well, mine’s also free to view if you care to view it”</em></p>\n<p>Rupert Clervaux’s new ongoing series takes its name from the notebooks of nineteenth century poet Giacomo Leopardi – these <em>Zibaldone</em>, the original <em>Zibaldone</em>, were a comprehensive collection of notes; personal impressions, ideas, observations, sketches for later, more developed work - published posthumously and just recently translated.</p>\n<p><em>“It was this idea that there was the sense of the real life of a poet or an artist from a long time ago, from another place - and this perspective you get from having the focal point of the poems themselves against this incredible landscape behind it; the Zibaldone. And that’s what I found so appealing.”</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/299764304&color=070707&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>It’s certainly a function of his own <em>Zibaldone</em>, which operates as a series of audio notebooks in which threads of sound, rhythm and spoken word are joyfully interwoven. Each release veers wildly between disparate pockets on an enormous map of musical hues; ambient glows, stabs of free jazz, lolloping anarchic loops, chatty, frenetic percussion exercises. The tone roams with the genres - in parts achingly sincere and then with a curt left turn mischievous or crude.</p>\n<p><em>“I wanted it to be like an audio notebook. So it’s not me saying; ‘this is my preened and stylised output that I’ve really thought about.’ It’s what could potentially become that later - but maybe there’s some value in seeing that process exposed, or arresting it before I think too much about how it fits into a specific vision of how it should or would sound ideally. I got that impression when I read [Leopardi’s] notebooks for the first time… that in his poetry you get a very different sense of the person... In the poems he feels open minded but very much affected by his ailments, and by his pessimistic tendencies. And the notebooks don’t seem to have this for me at all. They feel totally open, you know - sceptical and cynical in the old fashioned sense where you question all points of view rather than focusing on one and seeking to promote it. And I just wanted it to be like that. There’s no one style of music I’m trying to be part of or promote or... it’s just a relay of ideas”</em></p>\n<p>In each release we witness Clervaux playfully hold up and examine the rhythms, timbres, artists and ideas he adores. The project allows him to return to and explore his own fragments which may have otherwise lain discarded on the cutting-room floor, whilst simultaneously paying homage to the thinkers and poets he holds so dear.</p>\n<p>Part one opens with a soaring, cinematic discourse between wide, austere synth swathes and the melancholic chiming of a delay-treated piano. Over this, <em>Imitatzione</em>, a Leopardi poem, is recited by Mara Cimatoribus, setting the theme. The synths swell to envelop everything, apart from restless, partially obscured percussive rolls. These rattle around just out of sight before sweeping smartly on to centre stage and into their own brusque dialogue. The pace of the project unfurls as this; the continuous flowing  juxtapositions piece together a colourful collage, creating new shades and angles from repurposed material held in tandem or parallel, revealing Clervaux through his collected statements – that is, the words and work of himself and others. It’s a project which, whilst simple and visceral in its drive, is as complex as any relationship between a person and their passion. Clervaux explains to me that his relationship to music has been subject to modulation in recent years – its perceived function in his sphere, the time and headspace he dedicates to it, how it moves him and how he utilises it.</p>\n<p><em>“For years when I was younger I used to have an infinite appetite for intellectualising about music, but for some reason it started to wane... the more I became obsessed with reading, the less energy I had for intellectualising about music. And I’ve never really been a music collector, a record collector, so I’m a bit out of my depth talking about what year a record comes from or this type of thing. And it just suddenly made sense to me that I had a primarily physical connection with music. Playing drums, listening to rhythmical music - that has an effect on me physically, and that’s what draws me to music. And what draws me to literature is a more intellectual mindset and I wanted to find my own crossover, a different crossover to the one that I was used to. And I think that in a way, what I’m doing now represents finding a different place for them to intersect […] So, for better or worse, what I’m doing now, it’s just finding an intersection that makes sense for me. Thank god, at last, it really does, you know…”</em></p>\n<p>It is with the energy that he may have once enthused about the conceptual conceits of music that he now dedicates to articulating his own poetic thought.</p>\n<p><em>“Whereas music I can come in and out of, I feel very laid back about it. I get very frustrated if I don’t get time to write.”</em></p>\n<p>Clervaux has clearly a very pure and intimate love with literature. He references confidently and widely, quoting TS Eliot, Geoffrey Hill, Gottfried Benn, and Thylias Moss among others during our conversation. His <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/mitaminelab/ml186-rupert-clervaux-reading-from-the-book-of-disquiet\">mix for Mitamine Lab</a> contains snippets of him reading from Pessoa’s <em>Book of Disquiet</em>. He’s also currently working on an LP of his own poetry and music which should hopefully see a release around the beginning of next year.</p>\n<p>This love for writing he is now able to express with the <em>Zibaldone</em>. It marries two parts of an artistic psychology, instinct and intellect. He suggests the project could also act as a sort of reading pattern, marking a timeline by collecting the thinkers and artists who’ve meandered in and out of his thoughts, leaving an impression. The position that writing now serves allows music to occupy a larger, freer, more honest space in his worldview. And so the <em>Zibaldone</em> functions as a channel for Clervaux to harness and express the physical and intellectual sides of his artistic persona, in a way he feels comfortable and excited about doing.</p>\n<p><em>“I’ve spent years of my life talking to people about music and enthusing about music I like, and ripping music I don’t like to shreds for whatever reason, you know [laughs]. And I started to lose my energy for that. What then came out of this musical fallow period was that whatever intellectual headspace I have, I wanted to fill it with poetry, philosophy, history, politics… I didn’t want to put music in that space any more. And I thought there might be a more exciting way for me to combine my literary interests with a physical drive to make and perform music. One of the funny things that came out of that fallow period for me was just thinking about dancefloors again, you know... and I started dancing again, which I hadn’t done for years. I suddenly became obsessed with dancing again.”</em></p>\n<p>The fallow period he hints at came about after dissolution of a long-term project:</p>\n<p><em>“Looking back, I was just struggling against a democratic way of making music. It was almost a joke then that I had a tendency to be a control freak in the studio, and maybe after years the joke began to wear thin on all of us! It was a difficult time because we’re all old friends and I respected them a great deal as collaborators, and still do as musicians. But when it ended we were all free to move in the directions we were pulling in. And what I wanted was not to think about creativity democratically […] I mean, for me, democracy is a political concept, it’s not... it doesn’t need to be applied to art. And I don’t think that art benefits from being democratised either.”</em></p>\n<p>From this dissolution Clervaux found himself in a place where he wasn’t completely dissatisfied, but ultimately wasn’t pushing himself either. He continued his mastering work, his reading, his writing; he joined Hot Chip alums Al Doyle and Felix Martin in the band New Build sessioning as a drummer, touring and exploring this newly realised physical relationship to music with an excited fervour.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2856/34073169775_0ac3da92db_h.jpg\" alt=\"build\">\n<em>New Build</em></p>\n<p><em>“I would look out at a room of people and there was this group elation, bodies dancing, and there was an undeniable physical excitement to playing drums right at the side of the stage [a stipulation when performing with New Build] and having people right there who were having a totally immediate response to it. And where I’d thought that was the type of thing that I wouldn’t like so much, I was amazed by how much I liked it. It genuinely changed the way I thought about performing music.”</em></p>\n<p>The end of this fallow period he sees as owing to one person, his now long-time collaborator and close friend Beatrice Dillon. Meeting through John Coxon, head of the Treader label and half of Spring Heel Jack, Clervaux assisted Dillon with some mixing and mastering for a performance at the ICA. Following a collaboration at Cafe OTO they continued working together and have made some astonishing, considered records, which cleverly measure and plot weight over spatially vast or intricately detailed soundscapes.</p>\n<p><em>“...at the same time as I was playing in New Build, Beatrice brought me into a few situations where she wanted to collaborate - and very generously really, because she was out there doing exactly what I wasn’t doing; hunting for and finding opportunities. And she would invite me to do them with her... these resulted in ‘Studies for Samplers and Percussion’, resulted in ‘Two Changes’ - so, she was an instrumental figure in pulling me back into a creative, musical mindset”</em></p>\n<p>Remembering the writing process for their <em>Studies for Samplers</em> record he mentions how, “maybe the one rule that we said we had for that record was ‘when it stops being an idea we have to either throw it away or just stop working on it. Basically there’s zero production on that record.”</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/259426156&color=070707&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>Each instalment of the series is bound under a governing chapter heading, or theme; the first imitation and originality, the next mental health, the third government and politics. Clervaux is quick to point out that the themes were organic byproducts themselves, coagulating almost of their own volition. As certain pieces came to their denouement, connecting strands began to bubble to the surface.</p>\n<p><em>“At the beginning there were lots of individual pieces floating around, and I started to group them together. Then naturally for the first two [parts] some relatively loose themes seemed to be holding certain pieces together in their own gravity. The first one had this very poetic approach, and I wanted there to be a Leopardi reading. I was thinking about originality in music, because probably for the first time ever I was getting involved with cutting up other people’s music, and so there’s this Leopardi poem, 'Imitazione', which felt appropriate. At the time I was reading Silvina Ocampo, a phenomenally good poet, and she had a poem of the same name and, suddenly it was all there... These five bits that existed just needed a final topcoat,  and that was done. And I noticed that of the remaining pieces that existed there was a vague psychological theme to some of them. And that’s where ‘I on Crack’ fit in, and so I put those together and... it’s horribly disparate part two, in the way it goes from one track to the next [...] I feel more fondly about two than one in that respect because I think it’s more... brutal.”</em></p>\n<p>The themes are fertile ground for speculation, the use of sampling, drum loops, lifted lines of poetry, and fragments of his own work (the same otherworldly shimmers of the bowed vibraphone which appears in “A Different River Once” are heard at the end of part one) could suggest much about Clervaux’s thoughts on imitation and the nature of originality. But instead of determining whether in essence the value of originality is given too much stock, or instead of making a point about the intrinsic nature of imitation in art, nature, or society, Clervaux collects ideas about the subject and arrange them as interesting nodes on a larger flowing stem. And so instead of some incredibly arch comment on originality in music in which samples are brutally xeroxed to a shadow of their recognition, he presents some beautiful pieces of music interspersed with poesy about the nature of imitation. Which, when collected together show us Clervaux is aware of these pieces, he can see the value in them, and he sees them as valuable enough to present to us.</p>\n<p><em>“[TS Eliot’s] take is that all great art is historiographical and the only way you can be forward thinking is to accept that. There’s a sort of sham version of ‘forward thinking’ which says ‘I ignore the influence of others and what I do is truly original’ – and for some reason that type of sham thinking has been given a lot of currency. People want something that is a radical departure or a ground-breaking progression. That type of need has created this strange currency and kind of sham originality that likes to sweep its influences under the rug. And it was reading that essay [Tradition and the Individual Talent] that was another sort of influence for the birth of 'Zibaldone' [...] if we just talk about the concept of originality, I think what he’s saying has traction - which is that if you understand what’s gone before, you then have the opportunity to be original - but you do so wearing the debt on your sleeve. And that maybe originality doesn’t need to be this wow factor, it needs to be new ways of... interpretation. Of course, as time goes by we’re painting ourselves into a corner more and more if we need to have this wow factor – you’re either painted into a corner or the wow factor is not real... the choice is yours”</em></p>\n<p>And it feeds into Part two, in which samples of Angie Stone’s “Wish I Didn’t Miss You” and the O’Jay’s “Backstabbers” are turned into an eight minute building loop which ducks in and out of the stereo field. In fact, on the <em>Zibaldone II</em> Bandcamp page, Clervaux explicitly explains the intention behind this section:</p>\n<p><em>“...repetition changes tack again to reveal its hypnotic, abreactive side – excavating and closely examining a rich psychological seam in Angie Stone’s lyrical strata, as a fragment of her classic track relives its origins in the O’Jays ‘Backstabbers’...”</em></p>\n<p>In this track, which he’s titled “Memories Don’t Live Like People Do”, Clervaux has made a transparent, triple-tiered connection between the two tracks, exclaiming his affection for both whilst also positioning it in a way to suit <em>Zibaldone II</em>’s needs. As each chapter unfurls itself, it’s not a preachy, didactic listen. Overwhelmingly it’s the raucous, swerving-yet-calculated adjustments in pace and tone and nuanced production which hold a firm grasp on the attention, and as the strewn allusions to the thematic banners are suggested it is merely for the listener to piece together if they wish, rather than a lesson in moralising from the artist.</p>\n<p><em>“The themes bubble to the surface and occur naturally, from below, on the basis of what you’re interested in at the time. That’s a key element to how I feel comfortable working. I don’t feel comfortable working in a way where I say I’m interested in this and then fill in the gaps. I feel comfortable with a method which takes [an] interest and then works inquisitively. And you hope it’ll coagulate into something that makes thematic sense to someone who hasn’t been through that process, that they just receive it and think “OK, I can thread that together”... but it’s not a presumptuous thing. You hope someone will get it, and doing that you give them the freedom to thread it together however they like, and that’s fine”</em></p>\n<p>The sentiment is similar to one articulated by Geoffrey Hill – an observation in fact made by his friend but held particular traction with Hill;</p>\n<p><em>“[it is an issue] that somehow art is diminished when it’s overpowered by obsessive self-expression, and that somewhere along the line between ‘self-expression’ and ‘expression’ in its wider sense, is a sweet spot where it’s not someone just exposing, or imposing, their inner workings, their distress, their love... it’s something which is depersonalised to the extent that someone can just walk by it, or listen to it or read it and say ‘yes’ [clicks fingers] I get it, I understand…”</em></p>\n<p>And so the dance performed by the <em>Zibaldone</em> is a confident, funny one; one which doesn’t prize the way it looks and is at the total mercy of the music moving it. One which inhales its influences and exhales its author.</p>\n<p><em>“CVX represents a different side to me than - in the terminology we’ve been using with Leopardi – my stylised side. When I think about how I want to write a poem, or make a piece of music that’s expressive, it generally doesn’t have the sense of humour that I feel I have, as a person [...] As CVX, and in the 'Zibaldone' particularly, sense of humour has a natural role. And it’s all... and this is where the inspiration of Leopardi comes in - it’s all notes, it’s just notes. It’s not to be taken that seriously. They flow off the tongue, they just happen. And for the most part they represent pieces of music that would never have come seen the light otherwise. So in a way it was a decision to actually follow those whimsical thoughts that you have about a piece of music, or to retrieve that curious section that was discarded a few months ago - to do it and not to labour the point at all. Not to think about how it fits next to something else, and that’s it. Just like taking notes, like scribbling marginalia, but in a music studio instead of in a library...”</em></p>\n",

    "content": "<p>One of the things that has always appealed to me about Fasma Festival is the emphasis they put on supporting local talent as well as welcoming acts and DJs from abroad. This year, the festival will be showcasing  Athenian label Lower Parts, which also takes this approach with the curation of its releases.</p>\n<p>Founded by Panajiotis Vaxevanakis in 2011, Lower Parts ostensibly began its life as an outlet for nomadic electronics, constantly exploring new directions. &quot;The label came naturally after years of involvement in Greek electronic music from the late '90s&quot; Vaxevanakis tells me when we caught up recently to talk about his experiences running Lower Parts. &quot;It was after a period in which I was working with my buddy George as Urbanoise and got involved in the <a href=\"http://www.netaudioberlin.de/\">NetAudio Festival</a> in Berlin. It was really inspiring and brought us close with people in the 'business'. That was the time I thought it would be a good idea to make something like Lower Parts in the future. The truth is I was very optimist and wanted to make something more than a record label; a network of people collaborating. But that was not going to work in the long term, so after a while I just focussed on the music part.&quot;</p>\n<p>Debuting with the library electronica of Urbanoise's <em>Dust On Time</em> on CDr, Lower Parts have consistently worked to defy expectations. This release was followed by their debut vinyl, the moonshine hip-hop of Tendts' 'Slow Years'. &quot;When I put out the Tendts­ release, I didn't have a distributor, so for at least a year I was running this door-to-door, mail-to-mail and inbox-to-inbox.&quot; he comments on the early years of the label. &quot;Each release is plays an important role for the label and helping it to gain a little more space out there.&quot;</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/153675181&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>Subsequent releases include Anopolis' sequencer-disco, 'ΑΚΡΟΠΟΛΕΩΣ' and Dim DJ's collection of hypnotic rollers, 'Endless'. Then there was the acid-mindbender, 'Universe', from the late-Andreas Gehm, and the cosmic-electro of Detroit-based DJ Stingray 313's 'Cognition'. For the most part however, Vaxevanakis sees pushing Greek talent as the label's foundation. &quot;Supporting local artists is the basic element of the label&quot; he divulges when asked on the label philosophy. &quot;The catalogue is based on local artists. Of course there are international producers in there too, but the local element is crucial. It gives meaning to this being a Greek record label.&quot;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2852/34162260845_ff8f6b6155_b.jpg\" alt=\"lp\"></p>\n<p>By the sounds of it, maintaining this isn't too difficult as Vaxevanakis suggests there is plenty of enthusiasm for cross-pollination between different enterprises. &quot;Yes, there is interaction with others&quot; he begins. &quot;I'm always open to making collaborations and parties, or giving any help I can!  There is a feeling of community, it's very important to be part of the electronic scene in Greece so it feels right to be among people doing the same thing and supporting our scene to grow and mature.&quot;</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/190576327&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>An epicentre of some of this activity is undoubtedly Astron Bar, where Lower Parts have been organising events for years. &quot;Astron is a story of its own, its like the acropolis in Athens for the techno scene&quot; Vaxevanakis says of the venue. &quot;It's been there for years supporting the scene, the local producers and DJs with great consistency all these years. It's a small place with huge impact. I remember almost all my parties there, the ones with Hypermedium are always great and I remember a Thursday session I played with Kostas who runs the place. He came over and asked to join me playing back-to-back. He plays hard, banging techno, and I had some electro funk and disco pieces with me. You can imagine how it was mixing SAWF with Patrick Cowley (laughs). It was a joy!&quot;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2829/34121409426_e90d1f3d83_b.jpg\" alt=\"panos\"></p>\n<p>At the moment however, it sounds like Vaxevanakis partying days are winding down. &quot;I'm getting older and I like getting up early, having my coffee &amp; honey and an early walk&quot; he explains. A few years ago, we might not have got the same answer however. &quot;I did a lot of kilometres at the dance stages, festivals, mountains and seas in the older days, back in the late '90s to mid-2000s&quot; he responds when asked about his early experiences with dance music. &quot;The raves in the mountains and outdoor festivals  back then in the psychedelic scene in the early '00s saw some huge gigs with people from all the world. We are talking about five to ten thousand people at some points!&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;One that was a real disaster was in 2002 at a festival in the woods. There were three stages; one psychedelic, one ambient and one for techno! So you can picture an environment with psychedelic freaks alongside the techno geeks! The line up was insane, from Hawtin to Liebing , Landstrumm and many more along with the psychedelic DJs. It started raining right from the first day, the two stages had to close and put everything in one stage so everybody got together - techno and psy. People were throwing bottles at the psy DJs and others at the techno DJs afterwars. A mess! But they were great, happy times for sure.&quot;</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/286124234&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>For now though, Lower Parts seem content beginning to explore styles outside of the dancefloor. In December 2016 they released 'NSA Trusted Networks' by Ioannis Savvaidis, covering four arpeggiated explorations into computerized-psychedelia.  &quot;I'd wanted to put out an ambient release for a long time and that came perfectly with Ioannis&quot; Vaxevanakis says of the release.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2839/34031437221_2784df4de6_b.jpg\" alt=\"nsa\"></p>\n<p>&quot;Dim DJ had told me to keep an eye on this guy! Ioannis started making electronic music three years ago. I had listened to his early work which showed his potential. I was always asking him to make something for Lower Parts and the past summer he was in good shape and did those recordings! There were no discussions about the content, I just pushed him to record something and send it to me without thinking it to much. He works as a computer programmer so it was certain he would make something to do with computers! Now I'm waiting for his full-length release because I just cant get enough of his music. He is a peaceful, humble and discrete guy  and his music is full of emotion.&quot;</p>\n<p>Around the same time 'NSA Trusted Networks' was released, Lower Parts revealed their sub-label Helikon, putting out the paranoid manipulated field recordings of Sone Urbia. George Golfis, who also assists in the running of Lower Parts has taken the helm for the new sub-label, which looks set to become an outlet for the more leftfield, downtempo material the duo are interested in.</p>\n<p><em>Catch the Hypermedium X Lower Parts showcase at <a href=\"https://fasmafestival.com/programme\">Fasma</a> on Friday, May 5.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/309196273&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Early last year, Punctum finished recording their debut record, <em>Remote Sensing</em>, at the legendary EMS studio in Stockholm. After nearly a year and a half, the album is finally ready for public consumption. I have an oddly personal relationship to an album that is not yet released. I first got a taste of their work in <a href=\"http://www.straylandings.co.uk/podcasts/0062\">a mix from Maria W Horn</a>, which featured the heavy and hypnotic 'Quick Botta'. This became a major go-to headphone listen. Strongly recommended for long journeys in the dark.</p>\n<p>Technically speaking, a lot of the music on this record quite simple to describe. 303s, 606s and Buchlas dance around each other like an harmonic kaleidoscope. But listen to 'Glory Bitch' below. There's a lot more going on here than simple synth meanderings, the likes of which every bedroom producer knows all too well.  There is a meticulous care that has been taken in its entrance and exit. It's like a set of opening credits, or a tuning orchestra, setting the stage for something huge, before snaking away into the distance. Fitting then, this should be the opening for one of the most exciting records in recent memory.</p>\n<p><em>'Remote Sensing' is out now on Summe.

    "content": "<p>On April 27 we had our debut show on South London’s Resonance FM, which will be repeated on the last Thursday of every month.  We will be choosing a topic for discussion on each show, this month looking at physical formats.</p>\n<p>While discussions about the merits of vinyl and the short-fallings of digital are well trodden, the question of format is nonetheless central to how we think about music. It can often seem as if digital is here for good and will eventually replace every aspect of “physical” music production, distribution and consumption. Yet despite the seeming monopoly of digital, there are producers at the peripheries of music have continued to explore format as an artist device: from hip hop releases on VHS to Alva Noto’s butchering of vinyls. To discuss these ideas and more, we were joined by Bob Bhamra of WNCL Recordings, and Nicole Mckenzie, former buyer at Sounds of the Universe and owner of MIC Records.</p>\n<p>Listen via our Soundcloud below, and join us on May 25 on Resonance 104.4FM for the next edition.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2Fstraylandings%2Fthe-end-of-objects-wncl-cherrie-flava-on-resonance-fm%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>I was first introduced to the work of Matt Spendlove, aka Spatial, through the jaunty, disco-fuzz EP he contributed to WNCL Recordings in 2013. In contrast, his debut LP, <em>A Music Of Sound Systems</em>, focuses on reduction, texture and inescapably physical low-end frequencies, better in line with the leftfield sound-experiments he has released with labels like Broken20 and Stillcold.</p>\n<p>'291 Anu' clatters and scrapes across the stereo field, like a radio hovering between stations, while 'Isotope Scan' calls to mind the desaturated dub-techno musings of Retina.it's Resina project. Then there are offerings like 'Routine Conflict' which wrestle you into submission with grinding shockwaves of bass and stuttered percussive assaults.</p>\n<p>Taken as a whole, Spendlove has crafted a release which moves between ideas with rarely matched ease and confidence, simultaneously paying homage to the history of UK and Caribbean sound system culture. Given this context, we decided to catch up with him to hear about five of his most memorable gigging experiences.</p>\n<p>###1 Slammer _ 1990</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3944/33993345651_2ac4bf9b07_b.jpg\" alt=\"aw\"></p>\n<p>Where I cut my raver teeth. Seminal, a respected nightclub in Gravesend with links to some of dance music’s <a href=\"http://eddiegordon.info/page/the_slammer\">biggest names</a>. Details are a little hazy but it was a period that started with little genre segregation and lead to the creation of Hardcore and then Jungle. There was a mixture of (now) big names and local crews playing. One of the most memorable was Cyndicut FM - as Essex based pirate from just over the Thames who's DJ’s played regularly, which I think is still going!</p>\n<p>###2 LOST/Knowledge _ 1992</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2852/34123501745_b12a7059c1_b.jpg\" alt=\"p\"></p>\n<p>The two clubs that broke techno in London. Intrinsically linked for me as I was a devoted listener to <a href=\"http://www.dynamix-berlin.de/pdf/colindale.pdf\">Colin Dale</a> and <a href=\"http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2015/09/rip-colin-faver\">Colin Faver</a> (RIP) on Kiss FM who ran the seminal Knowledge club at the SW1 in Victoria. Colin Dale’s shows were in two segments: ‘abstrakt dance’ which was the club focused part and ‘outer limits’ which was the abstract &amp; experimental part. <a href=\"https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/1298\">Lost</a>, run by stalwart Steve Bicknell, embodied that across their two rooms. It was the first club in London to host artists like Underground Resistance &amp; Jeff Mills in room one while people like Aphex Twin, B12, The Black Dog and the Fat Cat Records crew played room two.</p>\n<p>I actually won tickets on Colin Dale’s radio show two months running to attend! It was the first &amp; second ever events, hosted at the Vox in Brixton (I think they’d run a couple of squat parties as Lost previously). I had to get a mates brother to drive me up as I was too young.</p>\n<p>The competition question was to name the track that Bicknell produced as Lost - a track called ‘<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG9_CdjFKvA\">The Gonzo</a>’.</p>\n<p>###3 Cafe OTO _ 2011</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2814/33312137403_eb88b74e7d_b.jpg\" alt=\"xc\"></p>\n<p>I’d been visiting Cafe OTO from it’s inception and was very honoured to win a commission to produce an event there with <a href=\"https://www.cenatus.org/production/sam-cafe-oto-commission/\">some friends</a>. <a href=\"http://julietippex.com/roster/ghedalia-tazartes/\">Ghédalia Tazartes</a> still reigns as one of the performers that had most effect on me to this day. His guttural vocalistaions, similar to Tuvan throat singing, produce rich, textured overtones and sit atop of naive electronics and collaged tape loops. A truly original artist and a spine tingling performance. Also supporting that night was Rashad Becker.</p>\n<p>In stark contrast with the autodidact we also presented <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Chion#List_of_works\">Michel Chion</a> the previous evening, suggested by a filmmaker friend. I was unaware of his work and academic importance with Audio-Vision but a little research led me to his work at the GRM and as a some time assistant to Pierre Schaeffer no less. The considered academic approach to performance was a totally different, mesmerising experience and a masterclass in live, multi channel speaker diffusion via an analog mixing desk.</p>\n<p>###4 KOKO _ 2011</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2923/34123501965_20edaece28_b.jpg\" alt=\"qwre\"></p>\n<p>I’m pretty sure I hadn’t seen Mika Vainio live previously but on the strength of his records alone he was one of my bucket list artists for the <a href=\"http://www.netaudiolondon.org/2011/festival\">festival</a> we produced in 2011. We commissioned a new collaboration between Mika and Bruce Gilbert (from Wire) and the performance didn’t disappoint, although Mika’s sound totally dominated, which was fine by me. That’s not surprising considering his rider detailed the pressure per square inch the sound system must be capable of producing and the KOKO rig was up to the task.</p>\n<p>I didn’t know Mika at all, but it was fun hanging out over the festival weekend and it turned out he shared a birthday with my partner which added to festivities - on the same day of the performance!</p>\n<p>An incredible musician and a huge personal influence - RIP Mika Vainio.</p>\n<p>###5 Mutek _ 2016</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2939/34123501645_c84a7c67a5_b.jpg\" alt=\"qwe\"></p>\n<p>I decided to revamp my music production setup last year and I wanted the same portable configuration to work as a studio and in a live setting. After collecting the new equipment I locked myself away on an island in the Atlantic and got started. Six weeks later I’d produced the majority of the debut album and the backbone of my live set.</p>\n<p>Through the <a href=\"http://shapeplatform.eu/\">SHAPE</a> network, I was pleased to be invited to Montreal for Mutek and used that as the debut performance. It was incredibly nerve wracking as it was a new setup on a big stage for a very respected event. I’m very happy with how it turned out. The set started with very abstract, but visceral material working it’s way up to be rhythmic and danceable. The room was full by the end and people were into it so that was great! The sound system was immense and the panning I used really moved things around - a couple of well known producer friends asked at the end if it was 5.1 which made me smile. There’s a short video on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ye6ymhtoJc\">FACT</a> if you’re curious.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://boomkat.com/products/a-music-of-sound-systems\">A Music For Sound Systems</a> is available now.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/298781273&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Ewa Justka live is like watching a scientist from a late-90s thriller at work. A giant bulb strobes and fizzes as oscilloscopes present flickering blue lines, occasionally jumping into mountain range formations. It's almost possible to imagine sparks flying from her machines as she conjures climax upon climax of crushing, atonal noise in a mesmerising symphony of redlining.</p>\n<p>This said, sparks are probably unlikely to actually start flying, as Justka is handy with a soldering iron. A number of the instruments she uses live she makes herself, also selling her creations online. Her Etsy store, 'Optotronics' is a trove of the weird and wonderful, from her spider-like 'JarSynth's to the 'MotherFucker' delay/reverb units. Each artefact is labelled with embossing tape, as if they've just been retrieved from a WWII submarine.</p>\n<p>Originally from Poland, Justka is probably best known for her workshops and live performances, yet a catalogue of recorded works are also emerging slowly. Her debut EP on Conditional, 'Efhksjerfbeskj' was brought out last year, featuring a brain-scrambling assortment of modulations. A credit also appeared on Manni Dee's 'London Isn't England' last month, and Justka also recently released the 'Acid Smut' EP on Graham Dunning's Fractal Meat Cuts, 'Horny 1-4' bending the acid techno blueprint so far it snaps, becoming something else entirely.</p>\n<p>In light of this release, and an upcoming performance at Norbergfestival alongside Manni Dee recently announced, we decided to catch up with Justka to talk castles, crescendos and kick drums.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us a bit about your live setup - is there much planning involved or are your performances largely improvised?</strong></p>\n<p>My live setup consists of few things: a kick, two claps, a homemade drum sequencer which runs the whole thing, a TB-03, a MotherFucker 2 (home-built weird double reverb/delay, that I sell on Etsy) and some noise generators that respond to light, creating a feedback loop. I guess it's both improvised and planned. How do you really plan live set? Do you have some kind of notation? Drawings and diagrams with exact instructions, minute by minute? I guess I know more or less how I'm going to start, then what comes next... The basic idea is pretty simple: constant crescendo, things accelerating, until it's unbearable.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/317494347&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>On the subject of gigs, I wanted to ask about some of the best places you've played live? I saw you at both Norbergfestival and Fort Process last year and it struck me you get booked in some pretty interesting settings…</strong></p>\n<p>I think Norberg and Fort Process are some of the craziest and most interesting places I've ever played... Recently I played in this fancy castle/museum in Central London. I didn't expect it at all! Loads of old paintings, weird sculptures (in fact, I played 10 meters from Henry Moore's sculpture). A proper, proper posh castle ! It was crazy to play acid in a place like that.</p>\n<p>Last week I played at Somerset House with my friend Jayson Haebich at this night organised by Graham Dunning. The theme was 'deconstructed rave'. It took place in this strange corridor (the venue was called 'The Deadhouse'). It was very atmospheric - seemed like some medieval underground of Somerset House. I also played on this huge industrial boat one time, Stubnitz, which resonates like crazy. That was pretty cool. Still, the Mimer at Norberg is the best.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2878/34123614956_b6dff2616e_b.jpg\" alt=\"qwe\"></p>\n<p><em>Live in Mimer, Norbergfestival 2016.</em></p>\n<p><strong>You featured on Manni Dee's 'London Isn't England' recently. Can you talk us through your contribution to the track? How long have you known Manni for and do you have plans to work on more material together?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh, that track is so awesome! But my contribution was minimal. I just read a few misanthropic sentences by this miserable and genius Austrian writer, Thomas Bernhard. That's all! The rest is Manni's genius.</p>\n<p>We've known each other for two years, maybe? We were looking for a flatmate and that's how we found Manni! We are actually planning to start playing shows together, which is very exciting. Our first time will be at Norbergfestival this year, in Kraftwerk. Kick, smoke, bright lights, hard techno, strange acid. It'll all be there. Very exciting.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/303464553&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I'm always struck by how little overtly political music there is in London given how chaotic things are. Manni's release titles have been a rare exception. Is this something that has entered your thinking?</strong></p>\n<p>I think art is political in itself (well, it depends how good it is) and one does not have to be super explicit about it. If you make music or artwork which is powerful, there's no need to explicitly direct it towards political issues, because political issues are universal, if that makes sense. If you make artwork that's brutal, direct and violent, which I believe my live set can be, in itself it's political.</p>\n<p>Well, obviously it doesn't have to be brutal, that's just an example. There's plenty of subtle and ambiguous artwork out there, that's equally direct. So you have to explain here what do you mean by political music, really. Does making a title “against racism”  or “Theresa May is a cunt” mean being political?  I don't really like the idea of making obvious statements in my work, in any nature. Again, if your work is strong, you don't need to over-explain it.</p>\n<p><strong>You're from Poland originally right? Whereabouts? What was your first introduction to electronic music and how has your taste developed over the years?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, so I'm from Warsaw... What a shithole! I sincerely cannot stand being there. But no complains, sorry, this is not what you asked...</p>\n<p>I think my sister introduced me to strange electronic music first. I was like 13 years old when she showed me Aphex Twin and some Ninja Tune stuff. Then I took my own direction, (perhaps obvious), towards industrial, noise, industrial techno... All those things. Then contemporary classical stuff like Iannis Xennakis or Ligeti and Penderecki, who I still admire the most. Now I'm really into strange acid techno, '90s Detroit, Rotterdam gabber, all of those sweet, brutal sounds.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/310888092&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Conditional put out your first release last year. How did you get involved with the label? Are records something that interest you much, or do you see your music as more of a live experience?</strong></p>\n<p>Calum contacted me! he's pretty mind blowing! Great guy. Scottish power! I would love to spend more time now recording things, I quite like it actually. I recently put a tape out on Graham Dunning's label Fractal Meat, called <a href=\"https://fractalmeat.bandcamp.com/album/acid-smut\">'Acid Smut'</a>. So to answer your question, I think both practices are important for me.</p>\n<p><strong>A lot of the instruments you use are made by yourself right? How did you get into this field? Is instrument making a case of happy accidents or do you know what you are aiming to achieve when you start building something?</strong></p>\n<p>So there was this time when I was pretty depressed and I decided that the only way to get out of that place is to focus on something very intensively. I went to some workshops and started researching more complex things. I usually know what I want to build, but then I experiment quite a lot. So I guess it's both, an accident and a plan. Obviously, there's a limit for an experimentation, as certain things just have to be applied in a specific way otherwise they just won't work.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2874/33321939664_bccf1dee86_b.jpg\" alt=\"we\"></p>\n<p><strong>My friend Harry was showing me you're selling these on Etsy now - how is that going? You get booked for a lot of workshops too right?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, it's going pretty well! Some months are more intense than others. In December I had so many orders, that it was frankly too much. I was just soldering all the time. That's not good. I need some life too. But usually it's about  three or four synths a month, which is perfect.  But I have new ideas for synths all the time. Some new things are being cooked up right now, actually.</p>\n<p>I do workshops too. I have a few coming up in Vienna, Zagreb and Ljubljana in May. I just ran one in Paris; this American school called Parsons New School.  New media stuff, very updated, if you know what I mean. So yes, I think people are very interested in learning how to build simple, DIY synths.</p>\n<p><strong>It struck me your live shows often have a visual aspect that directly reflect what is happening sonically. For example the two bulbs you use at your shows react to the sound, and I've also seen you play with oscilloscopes facing the audience. Is this a conscious decision? Do you see these visual elements as playing a supporting role, or more integral to the show?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, surely it's a conscious decision. There are a few factors behind that. One, I'm interested in creating multi-sensorial, perhaps psychedelic environments, and second, making invisible things visible. Let me explain it. What I find fascinating about an analog signal is that it's universal. It's basically a voltage. And voltage can be applied to everything and can be sent through everything. So basically that's how, let's say thermometer works, analog to digital converters and vice versa and the oscilloscopic CRTs , which I used for my show. The same with light, it's a signal that's being sent directly to bulbs. There's not much magic here.</p>\n<p>Many years ago I saw Pan Sonic, when they were playing in Warsaw. They had a projection of an oscilloscope and their 'usual' noises and rhythms. It was so powerful. I think this synchronicity of different factors even amplifies the intensity of multi-sensorial experiences, which is what I'm looking for. So yes, it's integral to the show. The other thing is, in electronics, everything is about manipulating the signal flow. You either amplify it or attenuate it. But I just find this signal flow very fascinating and the fact that it can take so many different forms. It's alive (like flubber)!</p>\n<p><strong>Finally what's next for yourself? Any upcoming shows or projects you are able to talk about?</strong></p>\n<p>So, as I mentioned, there's a live set with Manni Dee coming, at Norbergfestival. Recently I played with Jayson Haebich, a great artist and computer scientist, who does crazy laser shows, so with the combination of my stuff it was quite intense! I think we're going to play more.</p>\n<p>I'm working on the neon bulb synthesiser too (the basic principle is that rather than using chips, I will be using vintage neon bulbs, which work as logic gates, running on 100V). I have an exhibition coming up at Goldsmiths. I'm planning to do this as a multi-channel, multi-light, multi-sensory, (multi-uhh, multi-something) installation.  I also want to build some random sequencers with drums built in and acid-ish things. Strange FM radio sequencers... The list is long!</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 700px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2710835004/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/minimal=true/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://fractalmeat.bandcamp.com/album/acid-smut\">Acid Smut by Ewa Justka</a></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>It's hard to believe that Fis' debut album, <em>The Blue Quicksand Is Going Now</em>, came out almost two years ago. At the time, it felt as though ambient music was taking an interesting turn. Two years into the wake left by Tim Hecker's landmark <em>Virgins</em> LP, we heard wild vocal experimentation from the likes of Ian William Craig on the brilliant <em>Cradle for the Wanting</em>, and Pan were pushing their new age sound through Helm, M.E.S.H and others. Meanwhile, there was also a progressive movement in vaporwave with 2814's <em>Atarashii Hi no Tanjou</em>, an album that established the genre as more than a meme.</p>\n<p>One of the funny things about this period of 'ambient' music was that so much of it seemed to completely undermine the genre's supposed purpose. Far from expressing ambience, these albums were chaotic and restless. But if it wasn't ambient, well, what was it? Anyone familiar with Fis knows that nature, and its destruction, feature heavily in his work. You can find electronic manipulations of (what sound like) wind, rain, running water and more in the rich landscapes he creates. But they're not field recordings or simple samples. These sounds are a far cry from the naturalistic psychedelia of the Gas project, for example. As we discussed in an <a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/interviews/fis-interview-workings-of-nature\">interview back in 2015</a>, Fis aims to &quot;replicate nature, not mimic it&quot;.</p>\n<p>The somewhat hackneyed obsession with natural-artificial, electro-acoustic, organic-inorganic music can be clichéd. But on their new record, Fis and Rob Thorne present something that has a genuine uncanniness to it that is endlessly entertaining. Almost every track contains sounds that have my ears playing guessing games. You are continually led down garden paths, lulled into believing you understand the source of the noise. But before you get comfortable, the music trolls you; trans-mutating into an unrecognisable shape. Listen, for example, to the lead solo on 'Wooden Lung', what <em>is</em> that?</p>\n<p>Part of this uncanniness is down to the acoustic instrumentation itself. Māori sound artist Rob Thorne brings the instruments of taonga pūoro (literally: 'singing treasures'), including flutes, horns, percussion, and objects spun above the player’s head during performance. On 'Glurn Herrin', Thorne introduces the Pūtōrino: an instrument that is both flute and horn: both voices captured in one single take. The sonic mystery of <em>Clear Stones</em> makes it a record that warrants several return visits, with deeper listens. The album closes with a breathless lonely flute that sounds like the cry of a dying elephant.</p>\n<p><em>Subtext Recordings will release Clear Stones on May 12th, 2017.

    "content": "<p>The Voyder released <em>XXXXX</em> LP is one of the loudest things I've ever heard. I remember a discussion with one of the collective, who was saying they'd initially thought about pressing it to vinyl, only to realise it was so loud any stylus would jump straight off the wax as soon as you started playing.</p>\n<p>Written by Cornwall-based VORRS, <em>XXXXX</em> saw it's release in 2015, but as he explains the album had been in the making for a number of years previously. &quot;The album started in 2010 while I was living in New Zealand&quot; he begins. &quot;The first track I completed was actually the final track on the album, 'GAME OVER'. It was probably the muddiest track I had made up to that point but it's the only track that actually made me want to write an album. I basically spent the next five years trying to expand on that sound.&quot;</p>\n<p>VORRS first encountered the Voyder crew through Soundcloud discussions, although at that point the group hadn't begun the Voyder project, instead operating as a forum to share tracks between one another. &quot;I had no idea who anyone was or where anyone was from but we started chatting and sharing new tracks&quot; he begins when talking of their early encounters. &quot;To be honest it was a massive boost to my motivation - there were people out there smashing way harder than me and I had to be up there too. I'm still not up there but it's fun trying!  We met in Brighton to go to a gig and ended up jamming for hours. Arnod Vorrzpkngrr happened after a couple more trips and Voyder started soon after that.&quot;</p>\n<p>Where the noise and breakcore scenes propagated by labels like Wrong Music are often cited by Voyder, dubstep was the biggest influence for the VORRS project. &quot;I studied music tech at college at the same time dubstep was becoming more available&quot; he says of his early forays into electronic music. &quot;Dubstep gigs started popping up more regularly and I went to as many as I could, getting sweaty and going deaf. It's 100% what influenced me the most at that time. It just wasn't savage enough.&quot;</p>\n<p>His set for us follows on from a live set he worked on for a show at Towards Collapse a couple of months ago. &quot;It was recorded using hardware, mainly an Electribe and Kaoss Pad, with as much distortion as I can get from only one pedal&quot; he says of the recording.</p>\n<p>No tracklist available.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fstraylandings%2F0075-vorrs%2F&light=1\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>",

Their next UK party is <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/152179485315331/\">RECURSION</a>, a collaboration with Bristol’s 'Intervention' on the 27th of May in South London. In preparation for the show, we invited the members of SIREN to contribute to our That Time When series, looking at the shows and events that influenced the formation of the collective.</p>\n<p>###1. (Jay D) SIREN WAREHOUSE _  June 2016</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4269/34060828204_df38420f0e_b.jpg\" alt=\"1\"></p>\n<p>Probably my favourite SIREN event to date. It was utter madness, our ‘chillout’ room consisted of pink and silver decor, a large amount of sex toys and a old school arcade machine with free games of ‘Metal Slug’. It was absolutely priceless watching wide eyed dancers take time away from the dancefloor to play a classic shooter game. Billed as DJ JD, I played an all acid set at 1 o’clock as the warehouse hit capacity. I was wondering where the rest of the gang were as I waited for the build up to Rhythm is Rhythm - Beyond The Dance. I later find out that outside there was a man with a dog threatening to call the police and generally terrorizing the people queuing to get in, which had led to manically sneaking people in the back and having a temporary party lock in…</p>\n<p>###2. (Moonbow) All Tomorrow’s Parties Festival _ 2011</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4225/34093210443_1155da01b2_b.jpg\" alt=\"2\"></p>\n<p>Possibly one of the sickest line ups I’ve ever witnessed at a festival - navigating the clashfinder of Animal Collective’s ATP Festival in 2011 was endlessly challenging. It’s rare that you can see acts as varied and obscure as Terry Riley, Actress, Black Dice, Micachu &amp; The Shapes, Kria Brekkan,  Oneohtrix Point Never and Big Boi all on one lineup. I even credit this festival to my introduction to Garth Marenghi’s Darkplace as one of many TV shows they screened on their own curated channel in the Butlin’s chalet rooms, alongside meeting some of my now-best-friends, Flamingods, by being invited to climb through their chalet window for a mass jam on the final night - which in fact became the formation of their band! One of the highlight performances of the weekend was seeing Grouper play as part of Wet Sounds’ installation in the holiday park swimming pool. The sounds that the audience heard varied whether you were out of the water, floating on the surface, or beneath the water in the pool. With a heightened sense of hearing below the water, her soundscapes blended perfectly with the bubbling and sloshing water and the echoes of excited festival goers as their voices reverberated off the walls above surface. I’m a sucker for gigs in unusual spaces that are really sensitive to thinking “OK, so where would really compliment this artist’s sound? What kind of space reignites people’s excitement to see live music IRL?” - and this gig balanced that perfectly.</p>\n<p>###3. (re:ni) Outlook Festival _ 2010</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4247/34060828764_dc2dcfea4e_h.jpg\" alt=\"3\"></p>\n<p>Growing up in a tiny rural village where most people probably thought dubstep was a type of equestrian footwear, my access to underground music nights was severely limited. After months of blasting Scuba, Skream et al out of my car on the way to and from school c/o a compilation CD of my Dad's, A Levels were over, and my best mates and I wasted no time in booking tickets to Outlook Festival 2010, when the festival was in its second year and felt fresh and intimate (alas no longer). Considering the genre had its peak in the mid-noughties, I guess we were late to the party, but being in an abandoned Croatian moat with the bass of The Bug's 'Skeng' vibrating through my ribcage still gives me shivers today, and was the shape of things to come as I went on to live in London and become a regular at Plastic People's legendary FWD parties.</p>\n<p>###4. (Sybil) The Hatfield Forum _ 2011</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4274/34093210433_ee88d7495f_b.jpg\" alt=\"4\"></p>\n<p>This is both an embarrassing and life changing memory. I was about 17, at the beginnings of my forays into electronic music from an obsessive indie nerd teenagehood. Nero, if anyone remembers, were a popular brostep duo at the genre’s peak. My best friend and I went along with our respective boyfriends at the time to see Nero at the University of Hertfordshire’s music venue, the Hatfield Forum. It was (obviously) absolutely rammed full of pumped up bros moshing everywhere. To avoid being crushed by this testosterone fuelled madness we were pressed against the barrier at the front for the entire gig. Nero’s set-up was a giant stack of television screens and speakers, with them playing behind it, added to the venue’s sound system. I remember thinking it was the loudest thing I had ever heard. After this gig our ears wouldn’t stop ringing very loudly for a whole month, making even hearing what teachers said in lessons difficult. After that it quietened down to a constant background noise, but it’s never gone away since for either of us, and it's been steadily getting worse. As an underground electronic music fanatic having tinnitus for life because of Nero is a deeply cruel irony, and hard learned lesson to always always wear earplugs !!</p>\n<p>###5. (SLIME EYE) Dirty Talk _ 2016</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4246/34093210183_9650983bcc_b.jpg\" alt=\"5\"></p>\n<p>Having heard from multiple sources that Dirty Talk was the best party in the world, Lauren (re:ni) &amp; I decided to head up to Bristol to attempt to verify this. I don’t know if I can give it no 1 slot but it’s definitely in the top 5 - it was pretty incredible. Owing to Dirty Talk’s popularity, you need a degree of inside knowledge even to get a ticket, as once online they sell out within hours. The party essentially takes place in a cave: the upstairs is a brightly lit, beers-on-tap bar area, while the downstairs is basically a dungeon, complete with stone walls and an extreme downwards slant to the dancefloor. The largely disco and house set perfectly complemented the dark environment- can imagine that bleak techno in that space would have been slightly too predictable- and the crowd went for it with the usual Bristol enthusiasm. This is so cheesy I can’t believe I’m writing it but it was one of those nights where you feel like putty in the hands of the DJ. As with many great parties details are quite blurry but one definitive high point was either Jan Schulte or Gib’r dropping Michael Palmer’s She Sexy circa 4am.</p>\n<p>Listen to the latest SIREN show on NTS below:</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2FNTSRadio%2Fsiren-w-peach-18th-may-2017%2F&hide_cover=1&light=1\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p>There a few musical movements that have been as divisive as minimalism. In its very first incarnation, it was met with disdainful derision. ‘Going-nowhere music’ or ‘wallpaper music’ was no better than the so-called low-brow pop music of the day. Too maddeningly simple to be ‘art proper’. Yet today, the influence of minimalism is unbounded: from the locked-grooves of Krautrock to floor-filling EDM; from film soundtracks to the holy drones of Sunn O))).</p>\n<p>Given it’s sprawling history, definitions of minimalism are notoriously difficult to pin down. Repetitive, or meditative features are often singled out. But the pure tones of La Monte Young are not so much repetitive as they are monolithic; and you would need the concentration of a monk to meditate alongside some of Philip Glass’ chromatic experiments. On our second show with Resonance FM, we spoke to Lucia Chung and Martin Thompson of neo-minimalist label SM-LL to talk about minimalism today: its aesthetics, its ethics and its practice.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2Fstraylandings%2Fwhat-is-minimalism-sm-ll-on-resonance-fm%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>The summary for Jesse Osborne-Lanthier's Where To Now? cassette, <a href=\"https://jesseosbornelanthiernoir.bandcamp.com/album/from-a-flawed-apex-which-led-to-the-head\"><em>From A Flawed Apex Which Led To The Head</em></a> discusses taxation systems, before going on to explain the finer points of Lanthier's production process, ending by stating how it was written &quot;on exorbitant amounts of marijuana.&quot; It is this dichotomy which perhaps best sums up my conception of Lanthier's work.</p>\n<p>On the one hand he seems to put a large amount of research into his releases. With <em>CSLM</em> for example, a collaborative LP with Grischa Lichentenberger, the duo put together a considered homage to fading antiquities of domestic entertainment, using cathode ray television sets and VHS units to compose the entirety of the album's material. On the other hand, quotations like the one above suggest he smokes a fair bit, and other releases seem largely based around Lanthier taking the piss and enjoying himself; something I rate very highly in a climate where much electronic music seems rather humourless. Most recently he contributed to Raster-Noton's 'Unun' series with 'Unalloyed, Unlicensed, All-Night!' a frenetic bastardisation of &quot;EDM, big-room house, trance, and online production tutorials&quot;.</p>\n<p>On May 31 Lanthier will have a piece he composed with Haunter Records founder Daniele Guerrini aka Heith played at St. Elisabeth Church, Berlin ahead of an appearance from Merzbow, Keiji Haino an Balazs Pandi. With the show just around the corner, we decided to catch up with Lanthier to talk about the show, Berlin culture and breaking the American Apparel story live on 'Chaudtime'.</p>\n<p><strong>A piece you wrote with Heith is being played on May 31, as an opening for Merzbow, Keiji Haino an Balazs Pandi. You’re still gonna be in Canada though right? Tell us a bit about the project.</strong></p>\n<p>That’s the gist. Basically, I wasn’t sure when I was going to able to come to the EU, but I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to present a piece alongside Merzbow, so I agreed to do it satellite-style. What will most likely happen is that I’ll pre-record some ‘live movement’ in the final stages of putting the piece together with Dan [Heith]. I’m trying to exaggerate this process somehow, like amplify the fact that I’m not there.</p>\n<p><strong>Did the two of you work on the piece specifically for this show, and if so, did the billing influence what you’ve written? How did you and Daniele first meet too?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, specifically for the gig. I mean, for me the there’s not direct ‘influencing’ . There might be some subconscious thing going on, but I’m trying to stay pretty true to the path I’ve been taking lately. I met Daniele through Haunter. Francesco and him wrote to me in 2016 and booked me to play Milan’s Macao. I ended up really hitting off with the two of them and we’ve been in contact since. I’ve been recording stuff for an EP for Haunter, but have been quite busy working on different projects, so this sporadic Merzbow thing was the perfect venture to initiate the first steps of working with them I thought.</p>\n<p>Also, although I’ve often hinted and talked about ping-ponging stuff with collaborators online, I’ve never actually managed to do it (laughs). It seemed like if I had a deadline it would be an opportunity to try my hand at this type of non-IRL way of working with someone.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/275648566&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>What other ideas have you had for trying to replicate the ‘liveness’ of the show? Did you consider livestreaming from Canada or anything?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m not so much banking on that, but rather amplifying the fact that I’m not there. Like, adding interruptions to the audio, using sounds recorded from my home, working from bed and bath, introducing myself within the piece (laughs)… I’ve been actually been answering Dan’s emails from the bath. The process is part of it… It’s something I try to do with everything. Like, how do I make it fun for me? How do I make it personal? How do I make it mine? It also adds some kind of critical comedic aspect to it.</p>\n<p><strong>Has that always been the approach with your collaborations? What was it like working with Grischa [Lichtenberger]?</strong></p>\n<p>The approach is of course different with everyone. There’s the more serious stuff and then there’s this Homo Ludens thing, or just making something for the sake of pleasure, as often times it is very much with Femminielli Noir for instance.</p>\n<p>With Grischa, this took on a different shape. Still ‘for myself’, I find that quality in working alongside him like ‘I need to do it for me as well as for ‘us’ so to speak, but working with someone like him is not as straight-forward so to speak. The process is far less immediate. Much more meditative and demanding, but also the project had a tinge of depth that some other collaborations don’t share necessarily.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/269877827&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I get the sense Grischa likes to work with some kind of overarching concept…</strong></p>\n<p>Oh definitely. Like as much as I want to to be ‘for myself’, Grischa is like ‘this is what I’m doing’ (laughs).</p>\n<p><strong>Was that how Raster-Noton ended up doing the EP with you? Or was that planned before your collaboration?</strong></p>\n<p>No, it was out of the blue. Weird actually, since I’d already been doing stuff with Grischa and Robert Lippok. They apparently heard a track of mine in a CTM-related mix. It was something I’d never released and they contacted me through Grischa. As soon as they asked me I knew the EP that track was from, but it was far off from anything that ended up on the Raster-Noton record. It was way more Where To Now? vibes actually. Its a track that I pulled from the Where To Now? release at the last minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Did they give you a lot of free reign with ‘Unlicensed, Unalloyed, All Night!’?</strong></p>\n<p>Basically I just came up with the concept, and sat with Olaf [Bender] over a few months to refine it. I was working on the mixes with Grischa a tad, then in the EMS studio in Stockholm I met Kyoka, and she heard some of the stuff as well. She gave me some input on the tracks while I was there. Later on Olaf kind of fixed up the order of the tracks. I ended up canning one tune and replacing another, and that was it!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4225/34161482553_387a55c7e5_b.jpg\" alt=\"a\"></p>\n<p><strong>I managed to visit EMS on my way back from Norbergfestival last year, which you’re playing in July right? It’s an amazing setting. I wanted to ask about some of the more interesting venues your played at over the years…</strong></p>\n<p>Yes! Apparently its awesome. As far as venues there’s a couple that have stood out but remembering the names is tricky… There was this one underground gay club we played as Femminielli Noir that was insane. It was in Lyon, France. A beautiful place with just like jaw-dropping decor. I like dingy clubs with good soundsystems. There was this venue we used to host FTK parties in two years back in Berlin. That was super nice.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of Berlin, it was interesting to read your thoughts on the city from an interview in 2015. I was wondering whether your attitudes have changed to at all from when you first moved… You were talking about the pace of the city being slow enough that you could work in isolation, but its also possible to go and immerse yourself in the culture.</strong></p>\n<p>I still feel it has this slow thing for me, Berlin is tough for a lot of people 'cause I guess you can just fall into a party wormhole… Luckily I’ve never been into partying for more than one night so I’ve never really attached to that side of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell me about your party wormholes…</strong></p>\n<p>Hmm, I guess I could tell you about Bethlehem XXX… We had this spot in Montreal where we were basically free to do what we wanted. Our friend Brett owned it (and still does but is currently revamping into something else (Femme Fontaine)). This spot was like a weird ass restaurant plastered with paraphernalia everywhere. A restaurant mutated into an after-hours underground club. We threw a lot of crazy parties there… We’d do a TV show with interviews with local and international figures and artists, and would take mushrooms and get super fucked up. We interviewed Jon Rafman for instance (laughs). Bernardino [Femminielli] was the host, and Thea Govorchin is one of the actors involved.</p>\n<p>It was whack but super awesome. We even broke the story of when American Apparel went bankrupt, like live (laughs). We were interviewing Dov Charney and he told us live on our YouTube stream that the company was going bankrupt. This was two or three days before he went public about it.</p>\n<p>Chaudtime XXX was our show. ‘Chaud’ means ‘hot’ in french but is pronounced like ‘show’. This is a Christmas episode, the interview was with a local butcher…</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"415\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yWJrljQ0wWk?rel=0&controls=0&showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n<p>I did all the sound conception and live FX and stuff… It was very nonsensical/hyper-conscious/PC and not PC/freaky and like at the same time very ‘documentary’.</p>\n<p><strong>Its quite Adult Swim in a way… Do you miss this kind of stuff in Canada?</strong></p>\n<p>(Laughs) Yeah, I think Vice were interested in it for a while.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think there’s as much ‘fun’ to be had in Berlin in that kinda sense?</strong></p>\n<p>Hmm well with friends, yes, but it’s a tad pretentious. I’ve felt like a lot of people i wanted to interact there were standoffish with me like they were way more Berlin than I was, kind of thing (laughs). It can be very linear in its freakishness.</p>\n<p>I mean it can be the same everywhere though. That’s like chilling with musicians in general a lot of 'em, they only talk about gig shit. I don’t consider myself one. I like talking about industry stuff a bit, but mostly just saying how whack it is and that’s usually where it ends for me. I’d rather talk about real shit. Or if I’m going to talk about music I’d rather it be about the process than the semantics of the industry and the people that operate in it (laughs).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4198/34584363940_709e3a60b9_b.jpg\" alt=\"we\"></p>\n<p><strong>I was sad to miss your ‘909 Problems But The Pitch Ain’t One’ dubplate by the way. I was wondering what your thoughts are on Record Store Day more generally…</strong></p>\n<p>Put pressure on Matt and James [Where To Now?] and they will press it to vinyl (laughs). I actually think RSD is a sham. Throw shade at that shit. I mean actually I almost just don’t care because I’m far from it in general. Like I don’t go to record stores really, and I don’t collect records because I’m too broke all the time, so it’s kind of distant. How about you?</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/208247493&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I have a complicated relationship with records. I feel most people like the ‘store’ experience and the social aspect but I actually fucking hate it. Most store staff in London look down their nose at you, so when people bang on about ‘supporting record stores’ I kinda think nah. I worked in bookshops for years, and if you treated people that way when they were buying books you’d get fired real quick.</strong></p>\n<p>I can relate. I like the objects in a sense, but the industry surrounding it and that store vibe is like nah thanks. I worked in a synth store for years. There were a few people whose stuff I used to really enjoy, and when I met them they would just treat me like I wasn’t intelligent enough, or had nothing to offer them. I ended up kind of hating what they do and represent. I think that’s one sad truth about this entire music and art world.</p>\n<p><strong>For sure. With the store thing, I feel like these people are constantly upset about how more people aren’t buying tunes, but then you treat people like shit, so why should they? People get into this stuff when they feel welcomed and accepted.</strong></p>\n<p>Right. That’s what I realised about the ‘fan aspect’ too. When you’re not ‘popular’ or making a career out of music you often think about people who release the records you like as people to look up to. Then a little later on you gain traction. You are part of that scene now, you are ‘cool’ too, and then you meet these people you looked up to; their message, their talent, their brand… You talk to them and they are fucking shite. Then you realise it’s like high-school all over again or something like that.</p>\n<p><em>Find more details on the Lanthier's Merzbow support show, <a href=\"https://www.thewire.co.uk/events/merzbow-keiji-haino-bal-szp-ndi-heith-jesse-osborne-lanthier-20170531-1700\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/301015104&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Earlier this week, we lost Marcus Kaye, better known to some as Marcus Intalex, better known to others as Trevino. But for many, Kaye was always a point of reference in the constellation of UK dance music and electronica. The founder of three imprints — Soul:r, Revolve:r and the new-formed Birdie records — Kaye helped to promote a wealth of underground music that would otherwise never seen the light of day. To reflect on his passing, and to commemorate his influence, we look back at three of our favourite Kaye releases throughout the years.</p>\n<p>###Marcus Intalex &amp; ST Files // 305 [C.I.A]</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Br1xlbEvgOg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>In 1997, Drum &amp; Bass was in a weird place. After its meteoric rise through the early 90s, D&amp;B could now be found in the charts and on mainstream radio. Even David Bowie was doing it. So reclaiming an underground 'authenticity' became a harder task, but one that drove a lot of the innovation of that period. Records like Christoph de Babalon's <em>If You're Into It, I'm Out Of It</em> and the other Digital Hardcore Recordings sought a sound that was decidedly too dark for radio. The very earliest Marcus Intalex records like <em>305</em> slot into this historic moment. They represent a time where D&amp;B searched down into its roots and found something deeper.</p>\n<p>###Marcus Intalex // TB or not TB? [Soul:r]</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxiOl-1utGY?rel=0&controls=0&showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>Released on Soul:r in 2011, 'TB or Not TB?' was a seismic piece of lurching bassweight. As the title alludes, the track is driven by contorted 303 lines, peppered with bucket-drum rolls, itching hats and booming low-end. The track is a great example of Kaye experimenting with new styles while applying his own distinct production techniques at the same time. <em>21</em> was Kaye's only album under the Marcus Intalex moniker, yet provides a stunningly well considered cross-section of his ability to shift between genres, from more-or-less dubstep tracks such as this to the static-washed D&amp;B of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SM-21jM_ZrQ\">'Hot Hands'</a>.</p>\n<p>###Trevino // Forged [Klockworks]</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3o74Ul5JvYY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>The Trevino moniker was an exciting departure for Intalex fans in that it brought his ideas to different crowds and DJs. From 2011 onwards, more and more of Kaye's work could be found experimenting with this project. It's funny looking back at these records in the context of his complete works. Clearly, a record like <em>Forged</em> is the product of a D&amp;B producer foraying into techno. The Reecey bass and high-end rims could have been lifted right out of a half-finished jungle beat. It's sad to think where this project could have gone. Kaye released Trevino pieces right up until the end of last year.</p>\n<p><em>If you would like to support Kaye's family, the team behind Soul:r have opened a Bandcamp page to help cover funeral costs. You can donate <a href=\"https://4marcus.bandcamp.com/releases\">here</a>.</em></p>\n",

    "content": "<p>In <a href=\"http://crackmagazine.net/article/music/mark-fisher-interviewed/\">an interview with Crack Magazine</a>, Mark Fisher argued that &quot;there is nothing that marks out 21st century culture as belonging to the 21st century.&quot; Culture today functions on a bedrock of regurgitation and referentiality. This occurs to such a degree that nothing marks it out clearer than its lack of markedness. As Fisher puts it, &quot;appropriation is no longer signalled, it’s just assumed.&quot; DJ Sprinkles has embraced this idea in her music, rejecting originality in favour of pure referentialism. She aims to write music which, &quot;reflects specific context and environments and social relationships, identity relationships.&quot;</p>\n<p>Lots of music taps into this idea. Perhaps the most obvious being sample-based music. Samples attempt to destroy original authorship and turn music into a practice of reference, rather than creation. To take one extreme example, American experimental sound-collage band Negativland took almost all their material from exterior sources as a way of critiquing the notion of intellectual property. They found notoriety when Island Records sued the band for heavily sampling the artwork and audio of U2, on Negativland's <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U2_(EP)\">U2 EP</a></em>. There's a delicious irony that Negativland and their respective label, Seeland Records, both took their names from Neu! (meaning: New!) track titles. For both DJ Sprinkles and Negativland, originality is not of interest. Reference is the defining practice of our time.</p>\n<p>The latest release from Swedish label Stoscha falls into this tradition. The collaborative project calls itself 'rip ME'. The name suggests both the death of authorship (Rest In Peace) and digital 'ripping' of material onto a hard drive. Their latest 15-minute piece, <em>Requiem</em>, acts as a &quot;requiem for the individualist culture&quot;, weaving together music from 17 artists, including Ellen Arkbro, HAJ300, KABLAM and Sissel Wincent. The format is suitably obscure, limited to only 100 USB sticks. Therein, you will find the music organised into a system of folders, with one folder containing the 'original' contributions, to encourage others to make their own versions of the piece. With a project so conceptually loaded, it would be tempting to write off the music as a peripheral feature. But that would be a mistake.

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Riccardo Fantoni, 2017.</em></p>\n<p>In April, Hazina Francia aka Petit Singe released 'Akash Ganga' via Milan's Haunter Records. A frenetic mix of ruptured breaks, reverb-soaked vocals and contorted modulations, the release seems something of a turning point for both Francia and Haunter, marking a sound which seems somewhat uncharted to my ears. The closest I can describe it is to suggest imagining Shackleton working with an imprint like Staycore; complex polyrhythms work to dizzying climaxes between off-the-cuff sample abuse and deafening action-film stings.</p>\n<p>The release is also somewhat personal in nature for Francia. She was born in Bengala, India and a track on the album refers to the date she was first brought to Italy by her foster parents for example. Sonically, the LP is also littered with references to her heritage, incorporating polyrhythms and tabla drums heavily.</p>\n<p>Following the mini-album's release, we caught up with Francia to talk astronomy, the Macao occupation and graphic design.</p>\n<p><strong>'Akash Ganga' came out in April. Tell us a bit about the release and how it came together and how it ties in with your recent 'KIND A' 7&quot;.</strong></p>\n<p>'Akash Ganga' is my first real work. I mean it’s been a long task. I made a lot of research over the years, I took my time to think about the mood of the tracks as well. 'Tregua', which was released on Haunter in 2013 was quite different; it was simpler, an instinctive work. Totally different actually. There have been many changes in my life in recent years and my musical standards have been influenced by that.</p>\n<p>I wrote 'Tregua' in an impulsive mood. It came together really fast without thinking. 'Akash Ganga' is a more thoughtful work. I took a lot of time to write it, listening to a lot of music and catching influences day after day. A long time past so we decided to release two different tracks I was working on, on a 7&quot;. These two tracks are in the middle of this route.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/120863128&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>As you mentioned, both your releases have come out on Haunter. When did you first meet Daniele and Francesco? Which of the previous Haunter releases have stood out for you?</strong></p>\n<p>I have known Daniele for a long time because we come from the same city in Romagna. We first met many years ago through commons friends. Forlì is a really small city, so you know almost everyone, it’s incredible. At the time we played on our own, but our personal project Heith and Petit Singe weren’t ready yet.</p>\n<p>We met again in Milan and consequently I got to know Francesco as we started working to 'Tregua' release. We met at some event in Milan to promote Petit Singe. I really appreciated 'Silence Will Expire' by Heith (Daniele) and 'Meet Your Doom! (Green Death)' by Weightausend (Matthias), who mixed 'Akash Ganga'.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2844/34304920586_7c1cc71250_b.jpg\" alt=\"aka\"></p>\n<p><strong>I’m intrigued by Macao in Milan - have you been to events there? I had read Haunter do quite a lot with Macao. The project began with the occupation of a skyscraper occupation in 2012 I believe, do you remember the occasion?</strong></p>\n<p>No, unfortunately. I wasn’t in Milan, so I can’t remember the beginning of Macao. I started attending in 2014 in the new location in Viale Molise. I often go there for music events such as Dance Affliction or <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/752929161523772/\">Saturnalia Festival</a>. Haunter’s showcase with Moro from NON was really memorable too.</p>\n<p>The venue is really amazing. Many artists want to play there for the atmosphere in general, and the schedule of the club night. It’s so big; sometimes it’s totally open to the public; sometimes just a restricted part, it depends on the particular event. Macao hosts many different kinds of events; art shows, talks, workshops, live concerts and festivals.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/305407605&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>The press materials for 'Akash Ganga' mention personal references in the track titles - for example '27.09.87' being the date your foster parents brought you to Italy from Bengala. Are there other things to pick up on? I read Akash Ganga is the name of the Indian Airforce skydiving team, also created in 1987. Is there a link here?</strong></p>\n<p>(Laughs) I really didn’t know about Indian Airforce team, it’s just the case! I chosen the name because of my passion for astronomy and stars in general. Akashi Ganga means Galaxy in Hindi.  I don’t know how I first got into astronomy - I never studied it for real, I’m just interested in the stars, and the night sky. Sometime I go to the Planetarium in the city - I like it so so much. It surprises me every time.</p>\n<p>The whole album is linked to an Asian mood; the graphics, the titles and the sounds.  There are a lot of tabla or Indian references in my works for example. It's the case with 'Tregua' too, and I also think they will be present in the future, because I really love tabla sounds and melodic Indian chants. I often mix them into my tracks during live sets.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/171341265\" width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>Tell us about the types of music you grew up with. What were your first introductions to electronic music for example?</strong></p>\n<p>I listened to a lot of hip hop, drum and bass and hardcore music during my teenage years. Sometimes I get hung up on some genres, but even when I was younger I combed through all kinds of music. From Pop music when I was a child to electronic.</p>\n<p><strong>You were in London for a show on NTS a while back. Was that the first time you'd been to London? How long have you been DJing for, and does what you play on a station like NTS differ from what you would play in a club?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes! I played at NTS Radio in March. It wasn’t my first time in London, but I never played there before. I recorded a guest mixtape for Egyptrixx's Halocline Trance show on NTS in the past, but I have to admit that being there is totally different. I was really excited for that. I was nervous, but everything went well in the end! I’ve never DJd and I don’t want to do it the future, it’s not my purpose.</p>\n<p>When I mix, I use Ableton Live. I like it, even if I don’t make sets with standards CDJs. I enjoy making podcast and playing club sets too. When you start making music, you have to be ready for any kind of request; from a warm up set, to a club, live or a radio show. I think being prepared for anything is really important for a producer.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/311157416&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>The artwork for the release is by Giorgio Di Salvo. Tell us about that - did you have much input on its design? How did you first come across his work?</strong></p>\n<p>I know Giorgio for his collaboration with Marcelo Burlon. From that moment on (it was the period I moved to Milan), I start following him for graphics, music projects, and events. When I was thinking about the mood of my work I immediately thought about his graphic style. He has designed an amazing poster too, included in the mini-LP.</p>\n<p>He was totally free to design the artwork. I sent him a moodboard to refer to with some images i chose from the web.</p>\n<p><strong>Where are the vocals on the EP sourced from? Are they your own recordings?</strong></p>\n<p>I like sampling indian voices in general. but for 'Akash Ganga' I asked Elettra Esposito, an illustrator from Perugia with a really beautiful voice. I asked her to send some recorded audio and then I mixed it into my tracks.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally, what's next for yourself? Any further releases on the horizon?</strong></p>\n<p>Next is the 'Akash Ganga' remix release. I asked for the remixes through the label. We discussed the collaboration and in the end we decide to ask to Aïsha, Jesse [Osborne-Lanthier], ZULI and the homie Weightausend. I think it’s a really good selection. Right for this work.</p>\n<p>I’m also going to release two different tracks this month or next for <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/stoscha\">Stoscha</a> alongside Air Max '97, Carl Simon, and some others. There's another track for <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/midlifemusic\">Midlife collective</a>. It will follow a feature with <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/111x\">111X</a> for a personal digital collaboration project. I’m working on some videos too, which will be released this summer.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/314792547&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>There have been many facets to the career of Ian McDonnell aka Eomac. As part of Lakker he crafted '90s Warp-style percussive abstractions, while as a solo artist he has delivered everything from pulverising 4am warehouse hedonism to the more conceptual broken-beat experiments found on his Bedouin releases. Given this, upon hearing about the establishment of 'Eotrax', his own label last year, I was unsure as to what direction it would take.</p>\n<p>From what's been shared so far, it's going to be a bit of everything. The debut 12&quot;, 'Temple Of The Jaguar' dragged Eomac down to gothic netherworlds; tightly meshed rhythms skidding between contorted vocals and screeches of distortion. If ETX001 was about violently exorcising inner demons, the next offering from Laura Kilty, aka LAIR provides a therapeutic remedy. This should come as no surprise however, as Kilty describes herself as a &quot;producer, vocalist, artist, sound-healer and yoga teacher&quot; professing an interest in both meditation and psychoacoustics.</p>\n<p>Despite the EP's meditative qualities however, there is also a darker side to the release. Opener 'Invoke' and 'Meld' build to discordant <em>2001</em> style vocal climaxes, crumbling electronics and plaintive harmonics lingering in the backdrop. The 12&quot; also comes backed with a cathartic re-imagining of ''Meld' from Sandwell District veteran Rrose, crafting characteristically grinding low-end and construction-site drones from Kilty's original.</p>\n<p>The closing track, 'Searching In Circles' however, is undoubtedly one of the EP's highlights. Vocal loops unfold slowly, tremoloing gently between cave-dwelling percussion. The effect is both soothing and hypnotic; an excellent example of electronic music's potential medicinal qualities.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/317680144&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>As time progresses, Shifted's Avian label seem to be getting more and more confident releasing full-length works, maturing from the string of 12&quot;s and EPs which made up their early discography. The latest comes in the form of <em>Fit For Purpose</em> by 400PPM, channeling the raw aggression of  '80s industrial and punk scenes into a range of dirt-caked percussive rollers.</p>\n<p>New York based producer Shawn O'Sullivan has been operating under the 400PPM guise since 2013, providing Avian with a range of increasingly unhinged technoid experiments. This latest LP seems like a culmination of these ideas, straddling a line between the no-frills 4/4 reductions of Sähkö, with Chris Carter and Cosey Fanni Tutti's industrial leaning work.</p>\n<p>With the album released mid-May, we decided to invite O'Sullivan to talk over five of his most memorable gigging experiences.</p>\n<p>###1 Rural Fest in Niigata, Japan _ 2014</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4246/35114104612_5c25470a63_z.jpg\" alt=\"v\"></p>\n<p>My first gig in Japan, and my first time in Asia - a beautiful experience in the Niigata mountains. I was deliriously jet-lagged, and played one of my best live sets ever as the sun came up. After I played live, I did a DJ set. The crowd was starting to gear up for bed, but there was one super enthusiastic man in the crowd. Whenever I played something with a slightly heavier kick, he would get down on his knees and raise his hands in pure joy. I played for him, gradually getting much harder and faster than I'd intended to play, with the crowd building back up in numbers and enthusiasm. Super lysergic and totally life-affirming. So much love for the Rural crew.</p>\n<p>###2 Beat Box at Fairfield, Iowa _ 1998</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4230/35114104832_70407d32e4_z.jpg\" alt=\"d\"></p>\n<p>The first time I ever played records in public. I grew up in Fairfield - best known as the transcendental meditation town. The Beat Box was a sort of youth club in a small basement in the back of a restaurant parking lot. They had turntables and a crappy sound system.</p>\n<p>I opened with Patrick Hernandez's 'Born to Be Alive' (a track I'd learned of from DJ Entox's 'Disco Bloodbath' mixtape, and one I adore to this day). The five or so people in the room lazily bobbed along. I started cutting in a noise track - I can't remember what it was exactly, maybe the Fraughman record on Bloody Fist, or possibly a Masonna or Merzbow track. People seemed confused. I mixed into a Somatic Responses track, and everyone immediately ran out. I played for another 45 minutes or so and went home. When my dad asked how my set went, I told him &quot;I cleared the room. It was great!&quot;</p>\n<p>###3 David Lynch Foundation Concert at Radio City Music Hall, NY _ 2009</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4248/35150499991_e06eaf26ff_z.jpg\" alt=\"q\"></p>\n<p>My parents were involved with the Transcendental Meditation community, so we got good tickets for this David Lynch Foundation event. It was a pretty over-the-top affair, with like; Moby, Sheryl Crow, Seinfeld, and a gazillion others. Unsurprisingly, the music wasn't really my cup of tea (Badalamenti was great), but I'll forever remember it for two amazing moments.</p>\n<p>One: with Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney on stage for the first time together in fourty years or whatever, my aunt turns to Katie, my wife, who's a huge Beatles fan, and says &quot;wow, Ringo really can't sing at all can he?&quot; Katie responded, with tears of joy running down her face, &quot;I know. It's so great!&quot;. Two: &quot;this is kind of a....vocal meditation&quot;, mutters Eddie Vedder. He exudes rich-folk's humble bravado as he spurts non-verbal melismas into a  loop pedal. &quot;Ahhhh.....ooooooeeeee...AAAAoooh&quot;. It was the single worst performance I've seen in my entire life. Oh, and Seinfeld - he's a funny guy!</p>\n<p>###4 Martial Canterel at ISS, Tribeca Grand _  2006</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4266/35114105032_d5df914858_z.jpg\" alt=\"w\"></p>\n<p>Will Burnett aka Speculator aka the legendary Willie Burns used to do a party with Jacques Renault and Sam Delarosa (who I'd later form the band Led Er Est with). Defying all logic, the party happened weekly at the Tribeca Grand hotel. Summer '06 they had Martial Canterel (Sean McBride, also of Xeno &amp; Oaklander) play - I'd been a fan since his &quot;Confusing Outsides&quot; LP on Genetic, and was surprised to discover he lived in New York.</p>\n<p>He played an amazing set - nothing from the LP I'd loved, but much darker and more minimal, closer to John Bender. I spoke with him afterwards, gushing about his set, and he told me about the Wierd party, which was still happening at its original location, Southside Lounge in Williamsburg. The Wierd party was my home for many years to follow, and Sean McBride a dear friend and inspiration to this day.</p>\n<p>###5 Traxx at DEMF _ 2005</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4281/35114104902_e2fefa282c_z.jpg\" alt=\"p\"></p>\n<p>Melvin! My younger brother had raved about Traxx to me many times. He'd been going to see him at parties in the Midwest while I'd gone off to college and then New York. This was one of the first times I'd seen him play - maybe I'd caught him once or twice before in the basement of M Shanghai. His session in Detroit that year was simply incredible. Have you ever felt the gauntlet being thrown down? Traxx's challenge to the world stands uncontested. That night, he played lots of unreleased material from Jamal Moss, JTC, D'Marc, and crew, mixed with unparalleled energy. In the era of peak-MNML/micro, this was <em>the</em> antidote.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/318331845&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Conditional presents <em>Expanding &amp; Overwriting</em>, the debut album from Stockholm sound-artist, Daniel M Karlsson. Karlsson fits into a rich, and distinct 21st Century, tradition of algorithmic music. From the vocal experiments of AGF to the Jazz-like freedom of Mark Fell, algorithms have become a marker for contemporary electronic music. Part of this latest swing relates to the move away from hardware (synthesisers, drum machines) and towards software (coding, programming). In the last decade more than any other, laptop keyboards have displaced musical keyboards as the site of innovation.</p>\n<p>But using algorithms in music is not particularly new. One can trace 'automatic', 'indeterminate' or 'programmed music' back to the voice-leading counterpoint of Bach's chorals. Here, a formal set of rules automatically generate melodic harmonies. Algorithms are also found in the aleatoric procedures of John Cage, La Monte Young and Iannis Xenakis. These cases were more ideological, in attempt to erase the subject from the musical process. In the case of Cage, his chance procedures worked to dissolve the opposition between art and life. Music instead becomes a means of identifying the here-and-now. As Hans Curjel once wrote, &quot;Cage refuses choice. The historical duality of mind and matter, life and art, is dispensed with.&quot;</p>\n<p>When it comes to electronic aleatoric music, it can often seem as if an inverted Turing test is taking place. The trick is not to deceive the audience into believing that the machine is human, but that the human is machine. Unsurprising then, that Karlsson defines himself as a 'Transhumanist Singularitarian'. Singularitarians typically hold the view that artificial super-intelligence will be here soon, and will bring with it an unfathomable rate of change to society. There may therefore be a heterodox purpose to Karlsson's algorithmic experiments: to accelerate machine intelligence, and bring us closer to the singularity. If machines can lead the way in art as they have done in science, we could be close to a cultural Renaissance.</p>\n<p>But a cultural Renaissance is not the same as a political one. Karlsson states that part of what fuels his interest in live coding is in expanding an interest in computer literacy. As he notes on his website, &quot;I believe computer literacy will become a larger divide in our society in the future to such a degree that no one can imagine it now.&quot; One difficulty in futurist speculation is how you can update the socioeconomic model to match technology of the future. This is never truer than in the supercapitalist Silicon Valley. Here, Sci-Fi visions of the future are underpinned by excessive working hours and mandatory overtime. As one of Elon Musk's Tesla Inc. employees recently wrote in <a href=\"https://medium.com/@moran2017j/time-for-tesla-to-listen-ab5c6259fc88\">an article for Medium</a>, “I often feel like I am working for a company of the future under working conditions of the past.”</p>\n<p>Following a meeting at the White House as a newly appointed member of the Presidential Advisory Forum, Elon Musk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/827928366711967745\">tweeted</a> that he, &quot;doesn't want to get in politics&quot;. But unlike Musk, Karlsson is aware of the importance in addressing the political context that Transhuman Singularitarianism comes out of. In an interview with Lucia H Chung of <a href=\"http://wearehappened.com/\">Happened</a>, he spoke of his equal interest in Universal Basic Income and in the abolition of aging. The album closes with 'Zero-Hour Contract', a brutal reminder of the present before we can reach the future. Or maybe, as William Gibson wrote, &quot;The future is already here — it's just not very evenly distributed.&quot;</p>\n<p>Buy <a href=\"http://shop.conditional.club/album/expanding-and-overwriting\">here</a>.

Berlin-based Arboretum Records seem to have done things the other way round however.</p>\n<p>Following a string of 12&quot;s from the likes of Honzo, Drøp and label founder Marco Berardi aka Mogano, the label are set to release their debut tape on June 27. To date Arboretum have maintained a very distinct aesthetic, both sonically and visually, and this latest release from Tetsumasa Okumura is no different.</p>\n<p>Entitled the 'Obake' EP, the release is a fluid and subtle exploration into leftfield percussive music, from the faltering half-step of 'Mabolo' to the haunting dub reductions of 'Balot'.

    "content": "<p>Last year, professional cretin Deborah Orr of the Guardian bravely defended zero-hours contracts, claiming that, &quot;job security can be a kind of burden, a brake on the nurturing of hopes and the following of dreams.&quot; This is part and parcel of the Thatcherite dream, that the casualisation of work contracts will bring with it a kind of cultural Renaissance of free agents and entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p>But anyone who has tried working in music knows that this dream is a sham. Wages in real terms have fallen by 10.4% since 2007 (more than any other European country besides Greece). Moreover, self-employment has risen by 45% since 2001, with the average income of a self-employed person at around £12,500 per annum (about half the average national wage). The current Tory government proudly announce that employment has risen. It hasn't - the unemployment is hidden within precarious work and zero hours contracts.</p>\n<p>One sign of optimism came last year when music revenue increased for the first time since 1996. Sadly, however, this was almost entirely down to 'product platforms' like iTunes and Spotify exploding onto the market. You currently need 180,000 streams a month on Spotify to meet minimum wage in the US. The promised class of entrepreneurs aren't so much following their dreams as counting their pennies.</p>\n<p>Electronic music likes to present itself as a kind of liberatory refuge - a sanctum of socially conscious, progressive anti-authoritarians, keen to harness art's emancipatory capacity to equalise hierarchies and strengthen communities. Yet, music work can be one of the most exploitative sectors in UK employment. You aren't so much paid in money (God forbid) as paid in other currencies: 'experience' and 'exposure'. Payment for labour is a privilege, not a right. Hey, it used to be about the music maaaan.</p>\n<p>In this week's show, we spoke to Ewa Justka and Manni Dee about work in music: working for free, working for fees, sponsorship and precarity.

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Luca Caciagli</em></p>\n<p>The latest from SM-LL's Batch series comes from Andrea Taeggi, better known to some as one half of electro-acoustic industrialists Lumisokea.  The Batch series itself is somewhat enigmatic. Every run is limited to only 20 copies or less, cut to a beautiful translucent lathe. Typical of the heterodox minimalist approach SM-LL are known for.</p>\n<p>Both his solo work and his collaborations under Lumisokea seem to have an obsession with space: the location in which a sound exists, its environment, its placement. Take Lumisokea's breathtaking <a href=\"http://www.straylandings.co.uk/reviews/92323451438\"><em>Eavesdropping on Pianists</em></a>, made using the Vladimir Popov's 'Noise Machines' from 1920's Russia. Popov's machines were designed to represent the sounds of the coming industrial era, but the world Taeggi represents is still yet to come. To celebrate this new release, we spoke to Andrea Taeggi about minimalism, piano tuning and La Monte Young.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1100759704/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://sm-ll.bandcamp.com/album/batch-0006\">Batch 0006 by Andrea Taeggi</a></iframe>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about your new release and how it came about?</strong></p>\n<p>For me, it was just a continuation of the debut solo album under my name, <em>Mama Matrix Most Mysterious</em>. It’s a continuation in the sense of how I think about rhythm and the importance of stripping down the sound. I don’t know if this release is ‘more minimal’ for being on SM-LL, but  while making it I decided to draw my attention to using very few elements.</p>\n<p><strong>Yeah it seems, like a lot of your work, to be focused on the space of sound. The input is often very small (pops, clicks and so on), and placing them in huge cavernous reverbs, with very precise stereo-field mapping. It’s like a kind of interior design.</strong></p>\n<p>One of the most fun parts of making music for me is creating a space for the music to exist in. It’s funny – when you use synthetic sounds, they don’t really have a placement in the real life. They are kind of fictional. So you give them a space, because they don’t have one, in and of themselves. Not a resonant space anyway. You are always playing with this fictionality in recorded music. Similarly, a microphone doesn’t hear what you hear, so you have to invent a home for it.</p>\n<p><strong>I like how reverb is able to do that – to turn some tiny sound into this huge boom.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah I’ve always been impressed by musicians who are able to come up with strong material by using few elements – like with dub music, for example. Dub has this very special trick of being able to make music sound rich with the most simple of elements. This is something that still intrigues me. I don’t think there’s any real answer or procedure for how to do this. Sometimes it works and sometimes not – this is what interests me. It’s a kind of magic.</p>\n<p><strong>I read that you were recently learning a piece of La Monte Young’s music. He’s the master of that trick, right?</strong></p>\n<p>Well… yeah (laughs). For sure, especially ‘The Well-Tuned Piano’, it’s just genius. Much of that work rests on the tuning that he used. The sound of the strings just completely transforms because of that. You’re not hearing a piano anymore, just because of how he tuned it. So yeah, this ability - to make complex music from simple elements, which sound special in and of themselves - is something which inspired in me a general fascination with minimalism.</p>\n<p><strong>Did you ever finish learning ‘The Well-Tuned Piano?’</strong></p>\n<p>I learned the first two hours (laughs). It’s five hours long and at some point I had to stop for a number of practical reasons. I may pick it up in a few years, so it’s not completely abandoned. But it was a great process, if only to learn how to tune pianos which has come in handy. But it also taught me a lot about the mathematics behind the fractionary system he used to tune intervals and on how harmonies work in nature.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3123643405/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=4122391735/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://andreataeggi.bandcamp.com/album/mama-matrix-most-mysterious-type\">Mama Matrix Most Mysterious (Type) by Andrea Taeggi/Gondwana</a></iframe>\n<p><strong>Your background is in acoustic instrumentation, isn’t it?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah I am a pianist – specifically from a jazz background, and I did a lot of improvised music when I was living in Amsterdam. In Holland, they are quite rooted in a radical improvisation background, since the 1950s really. For quite a few years I was mainly playing prepared piano. By the way, the new work I’m composing is mostly prepared piano, so I’m going back to my origins.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit more about this project?</strong></p>\n<p>This new work will be largely based on recordings of the inside part of the piano. What fascinates me is its great wealth of timbres and textures. On top of that I’m a big fan of the sound of wooden and metallic objects in general. Having received a formal piano education, I grew tired of the sort of ‘stiffness’ that piano has, when you compare it to other instruments: there’s nothing in between two notes (it’s either C or C#) and you are not obliged to prepare before making a sound (unlike trumpet or cello players who are constantly tuning their notes as they play), you simply press the key and there is your sound. With my new work I would also like to show how closely related prepared piano and certain electronic sounds actually are. The other challenge will be to bring those sounds I discovered during my free improv years into the territory of composed music.</p>\n<p><strong>Since you come from a jazz background, do you use improvisation in your music?</strong></p>\n<p>The way jazz musicians typically improvise is in referring to a kind of language. So there is like an idiom they use to refer to. As far as I’m aware I don’t make reference to a kind of idiom or language that belongs to an era. Whereas if you’re a jazz musician, the tendency is to imitate and reproduce the sound of your favourite players. In my music, I don’t use somebody else’s language to reproduce a kind of idiom - at least not intentionally. But I do ‘improvise’ – a lot of the Lumisokea stuff for example is improvised – and then later edited. But it’s not like improvisation in the sense that jazz musicians do it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4277/35120947710_4090a8957d_b.jpg\" alt=\"lum\">\n<em>Lumisokea</em></p>\n<p><strong>So how did you move form acoustic music to your current interests?</strong></p>\n<p>I became increasingly interested in electro-acoustic sounds. In fact, I would still define myself as an electro-acoustic musician. And when I was in Amsterdam I became gradually interested in electronic music – it changed my whole perspective of what is actually possible with sound. My very first encounters were around the early dubstep records. I was very shocked (laughs). But it shocked me in a positive way. Also Alva Noto with Ryuichi Sakamoto of course. This music helped me to make a transition, in the sense that I saw how to integrate the piano into electronic music.</p>\n<p><strong>And I guess your Gondwana project is one step even further away from those acoustic roots.</strong></p>\n<p>Very much so. Stephen from Opal Tapes gave me some hints about what I could try and develop within that project. So the latest Gondwana is based from a few hints I was given after a live show a while back. It was fun to really push that electronic stuff into a territory that was relatively new to me.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there other, stylistic or philosophical differences between the Gondwana project and the music you make under your own name?</strong></p>\n<p>I find the music that I make under my own name to be a little more empty than say the Gondwana project. That’s partly because of the way that music came out – <em>Mama Matrix Most Mysterious</em> was the result of a residency I did at EMS studios, where I had no idea how to use those machines. And similarly, this new release is the result of playing around in a studio in Holland, where I also did not know how to use those machines. I was curious and motivated to learn. So in that sense, those records are more of a shot in the dark.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3411274711/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://opaltapes.com/album/gondwana-aum\">Gondwana - AUM by Gondwana</a></iframe>\n<p><strong>I was interested to read about your approach to the gear at EMS – you said that learning the Buchla is more about adaption than mastery.</strong></p>\n<p>Oh yeah the Buchla is a total monster. It’s quite inspiring because you’re suddenly confronted by your own limitations. It’s actually your limitations that shape the path you walk down. And that’s not a bad thing, it can be an advantage; it forces you to be creative because you can’t rely on your old habits. When you have very few elements to work with, things seem to evolve faster. It’s like the idea of the bottleneck in evolutionary theory – the constraints help to push things along faster.</p>\n<p><strong>Yeah I have the seem feeling towards digital music, it's almost as if there are too many available avenues to go down sonically.</strong></p>\n<p>Sometimes it feels as though we are overwhelmed by possibilities and this can inhibit your process in a way. When you have an infinite amount of VSTs, where do you start? Whereas the physical constraints of, say, a piano, forces you to use odd tunings, preparations, manipulate the sound, circumvent tradition, pushing its cultural and sonic borders…</p>\n<p><em>Andrea Taeggi's new EP is available to buy <a href=\"https://sm-ll.bandcamp.com/album/batch-0006\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/227142418&color=0f0e0e&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>The latest to merge from the nascent π Electronics roster is Damcase (real name Dimitris Damaskos). 2016 saw a bumper year for Damaskos, with three vinyl releases including one on Bas Mooy's prolific Mord imprint and the legendary Bunker Records. Much of Damaskos' brand of techno brings to mind the heydey of DIY bedroom electronics. Listen, for example, to the full-throttle pelt of his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNV02u9ZJNk\">Bunker release</a>. There is a clear slapdash approach to these productions. They feel as though they have been made on-the-spot and in-the-moment. Everything is simply pushed to the max: subtlety is auxiliary. This gives them an immense projection velocity; one that cannot be matched by over-considered productions.</p>\n<p>This latest release on π is particularly nasty. Each basslines is a little snot-nosed bastard. Like some pissed-off pitbull, they snarl and bare their teeth. The release is also electrified by sharp static that snaps out in random bursts like a live wire. By the end, everything is caked in a blanket of noise, almost too harsh for the human ear. Totally anti-social, totally obnoxious and totally gripping.

    "content": "<p>The first time I listened to Swan Meat, it was sound-tracking some of the worst flight turbulence I’ve ever experienced; the match seemed oddly fitting. Hailing from Washington DC, she has carved a path for herself with little regard for the sobriety of many contemporary electronic music circles. With the aesthetic of a college metal band, her work is part absurdist humour, part epiphanic realisations.</p>\n<p>The latest release sees her team up with Japanese producer Yoshitaka Hikawa, delivering four jolting explorations into glitch, ambient, trap and a whole lot more. ‘Knife Splits Ice’ is available as a cassette via Apothecary Compositions, featuring fittingly unsettling artwork by Monia Ben Hamouda.</p>\n<p>As a whole the release feels as if it has been crushed and reassembled several times over; the duo have co-opted a startling array of sample sources from the expected found sounds and distortion clad rhythms, to some wickedly contorted pop and R&amp;B references. 'Nightmare aftercare' for example is a host of twitching abstractions, breaking into raucous sample butchery in its second half. The approach is DIY and unconcerned with polishing the rough edges, giving it a wild and unhinged feel.</p>\n<p>Tin pipe rhythms and warped vocals a recurrent theme. 'Casual Surgical Slang' skips and stutters between cleansing pulses of low-end and faltering glitches, while 'No, no, no' feels like being spiked with acid at a swingers party. Fractal modulations and heavily processed dulcet tones work in odd contortions beneath the repeated &quot;no bra, no panties&quot; spoken interjections.</p>\n<p>One thing that had surprised me is how direct and confrontational the release is, given it is so abstract. '&amp; wrench aught of death' makes a good example of this interplay, breaking into power-synth stabs and tool-shed halfstep after several minutes of faded-afterparty chatter and super-stretched industrial tones.</p>\n<p>It takes a great deal of confidence to try and align the different approaches taken on 'Knife Splits Ice', and an even greater deal of skill to carry it off so successfully.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/329629600&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Paige Ofosu.</em></p>\n<p>Hidden Hawaii are a rare breed of label. The strongest indicator of their sound would be to term it as a drum &amp; bass imprint, yet your typical D&amp;B fans would likely feel as though you'd tried to miss-sell them something presented with this descriptor. While many of the records utilise high tempos, dizzying poly-rhythms and tectonic surges of low-end, you won't find any hype MCs or double-drops here.</p>\n<p>I first happened on the label back in 2015 after over-saturating myself with dub-techno. Hidden Hawaii seemed somehow linked to the lineage of labels like Chain Reaction, yet their amalgamation of electronic-dub, D&amp;B and ambient also seemed a refreshingly novel combination.</p>\n<p>Run by Felix K, Wan.2 and a number of others, maintaining this distinct style necessitates keeping the circle tight. There are plenty of repeat offenders on Hidden Hawaii, one of my favourites being London-based Dylan Brownsword, aka DB1. Brownsword debuted on Hidden Hawaii LTD in 2012, contributing 'Vanguard' - a decidedly off-kilter percussive exploration into dub and D&amp;B - to a split-12&quot; with Martsman.</p>\n<p>Since then he has released exclusively on Hidden Hawaii and it's assorted sub-labels. This culminated in his debut album unleashed last month, <em>Zwischenwelt</em>. The record sees Brownsword at his most freeform and exploratory yet, mixing the faster tempos we have come to expect from him with some wickedly unconventional takes on techno - from the skidding, scuba dive textures of 'Zukr', to the caustic, 'Drft Part 2'.</p>\n<p>Given its release last month, we decided to catch up with Brownsword to discuss the album, soundsystem culture and growing up with '90s hardcore.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Zwischenwelt</em>, your debut LP was released last month. Tell me a bit about the album - how long had it been in the making?</strong></p>\n<p>I went to Berlin at the end of 2015 for two months with all the modular stuff. I was over there just jamming and making loops. Basically I made a lot of stuff, a lot of it wasn't really great but there were a few things I really liked. I spent about two months when I came back to the UK mixing the tracks and making them a bit better formed. It was made across two months and then polished across two months.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4229/35063885343_94a807f70a_z.jpg\" alt=\"a\"></p>\n<p><em>Vinyl copies of Zwischenwelt.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Did you know you wanted to do an album when you started or was it another EP that got out of control?</strong></p>\n<p>It was definitely designed as an album. Felix signed 'Vanguard' in 2010, then it was released as a 12&quot; in 2012. He was like &quot;it'd be great if you could make an album&quot;, but that was back when it was taking me like a year to finish a track so I was a bit like &quot;you've got to be joking&quot; - there's no way that's going to happen. But getting into modular and having a bit more of a focused workflow; I kind of thought at that point I can make an album around that. I wanted to make tracks that fit with one another and feel connected. The stuff I make is on a certain vibe anyway, it's not like I had to tame my liquid side to go and make some weirder stuff  (laughs).</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/2262889&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>It was partly because I'd just finished a job and was at a point where I could go and do that, it was an opportunity.</p>\n<p><strong>On a related note I saw you have this mod_85 account on Soundcloud. Did you start that when you were getting into modular stuff?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah. It was partly inspired by Martin [Thompson]'s <a href=\"http://mono-log.org/\">one track a day</a> thing. Getting stuff up there quickly. I think what was quite good with that was at the start of the process I had quite a classic D&amp;B philosophy that a track should be highly produced and have these elements which all sit to create this slick thing. But putting those up and talking to people like Martin kind of make you think that a track can just be a couple of elements that just sound good together.</p>\n<p>I think I will probably try and do more of that mod_85 stuff. It's quite nicely throwaway. If someone told me one of those tracks was really shit it wouldn't bother me because they took like 30 minutes each, but if someone said a track on the album was really shit I'd be a bit like... damn (Laughs).</p>\n<p>I think also when you make stuff on that kind of format, when you listen back things that you didn't think sounded great sound quite cool. It gives you a new perspective on your work. It's also just good fun and a good excuse to take photos of the modular!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4253/35023427104_3c0c8c5acf_b.jpg\" alt=\"gear\"></p>\n<p><em>Brownsword's Akemie Castle.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Where does the album title come from too? It translates as 'the in-between world' right? Does it have any reference to the group on Rephlex?</strong></p>\n<p>We saw that ages after the album! It translates as 'limbo' too. There's is an artist name whereas mine is an album name so I think it's fine. The name's a summation of a few things. Hidden Hawaii's not really techno and not really D&amp;B, it's a mixture of the two. Also I guess I was very much from London but living in Berlin when I wrote it which felt quite weird. It was fun but strange not being at home and knowing many people. Also with the sound of the album, what I wanted to get to was not having obvious sounds that you can hear - I wanted it to be quite hazy. The vibe is a little bit obscured.</p>\n<p>What was cool was when Sebastian Manger did the artwork, I sent him a super vague description and he came back with that image straight away. It was exactly what I was trying to get at. I didn't want to get into the whole thing of asking him to change colours and stuff, because I don't really know about artwork. It's nice what he came up with, a bit in focus, a bit out of focus; you can see it's something but aren't quite sure what.  I spent a bit of time trying to work out what it was, then told myself to never try and figure it out as it would spoil the whole thing!</p>\n<p><strong>I also thought it had a mix of looking quite organic but also very geometric in some ways which really fits with the Hidden Hawaii sound.&quot;</strong></p>\n<p>I think sometimes it looks like a  dandelion, then other times I think it looks like DNA or something. But then I think the moment you decide on something it kind of spoils the ambiguity.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you first meet Felix and get involved with the label?</strong></p>\n<p>It must have been about the mid-00s. There was a label called Bassbin Records which was an Irish D&amp;B label, but there was a link to Technicality and that whole scene. Felix came over to a few parties in London around that time and I met him through friends, and also Phillip who is on the label.</p>\n<p>Around the same time I started going to Berlin quite a lot to techno things. Felix has always been a super friendly guy and would invite me round his house and cook me food, so it was kind of that really.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/245266078&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>So you've been going between Berlin for a while?</strong></p>\n<p>Around that time everyone in London discovered you could go to these amazing parties in Berlin and it was a bit more open; you could go to Berghain and stay there til 2pm. That kind of thing wasn't really happening in London and it probably still isn't. So me and a few friends including James [Parker aka Logos] used to go over there quite a lot and party. I then got to know Felix quite well through that.</p>\n<p>It's interesting because he used to come to London a lot, but he doesn't so much now. I feel like the cultural interest has moved a bit. London was quite a happening place maybe if you weren't so interested in just techno. But now it feels like the focus is really on Berlin.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4286/35863128405_e25a08ce0b_b.jpg\" alt=\"we\"></p>\n<p><em>Felix K in Brownsword's London studio.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Were you into D&amp;B from the early days then?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah - I was into hardcore as a teenager. I lived on the edge of London, near Essex. It was a real hardcore place. When that turned into D&amp;B I just sort of followed that. There is that continuum that you go on; grime and garage never really entered into that for me. But dubstep I was really into. I have always followed D&amp;B really, even when everyone says it's shit and dead, there's always good music if you dig around for it.</p>\n<p><strong>Did you used to go to dodgy raves of the motorway and that kind of thing? What was the first D&amp;B party you went to?</strong></p>\n<p>(Laughs) I think those days were before my time. I think the first thing I ever went to was at Labyrinth in Dalston. It was fucking insane and actually fairly scary. There were bouncers with necks like the same size as their heads.</p>\n<p><strong>I'm imagining Dalston wasn't quite the same as it is now...</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah imagine a totally different place! (Laughs) Anyway that was cool and then I used to go to a lot of raves like Desire and things like that. Just big raves. But then at some point you realise every DJ is just playing the same ten tracks over and over again. After that was when I got into Metalheadz and Blue Note and all that kind of thing - the more overtly experimental side of things...</p>\n<p>In the '90s D&amp;B and hardcore was really everywhere, and a lot of my friends had this thing where they grew up and got into house music and garage music because it was seen as more mature. I really like some of those styles, especially US house music, but I never quite managed to give up on the faster stuff.</p>\n<p>Jungle just sounded more exciting at the time and D&amp;B also seemed more exciting. I think for me around '98 with Ed Rush &amp; Optical and all that sort of thing I was just going out every weekend to see the most amazing music and it was really really good.</p>\n<p><strong>Did you start playing out when you did the DB1 project or were you playing out before?</strong></p>\n<p>I ran a night with James for about four or five years that had a license til 6am. We would go and get pissed and no-one would be there til 1am. Then a load of drunk people would turn up and dance to whatever you played them! It was quite sweet really. You could get away with playing some quite experimental stuff just because everyone was a bit fucked and not too bothered. It was at The Castle in Whitechapel. It still exists but I think it's a bit more organised now.</p>\n<p>That was really good fun, but I think DJings a hard one because the music I play, I'm not sure there's a massive crowd that would want to hear it. It's fine if you're a producer and you make an obscure track, send it out and everyone goes that's a bit weird, because you haven't really lost anything. But when you're a DJ and you play obscure stuff and everyone's looking at you going &quot;that's really fucking weird!&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Three minutes starts feeling like a very long time...</strong></p>\n<p>(Laughs) Yeah, and then you're thinking what have I got that's got a big drop in it that I can play... So even though I've mixed records, and played out quite a lot, DJing to me is way less interesting than producing because the limitation of what you can do with it is really restrictive. I listen to a lot of reggae music as well and when I go and see someone like Jah Shaka, he just plays what he wants to play and the crowd is very open to whatever he wants to do. The electronic music crowd in London today aren't really, they've got strong expectations.</p>\n<p><strong>I was wondering whether the dub influence in your work comes from dub techno - Rhythm &amp; Sound and that kind of thing or actual dub.</strong></p>\n<p>Probably a bit of both to be honest. I think dub pre-dated my interest in Chain Reaction. Dub was a massive part of jungle and being really into jungle was like trying to discover where all these samples were coming from. They're also linked by soundsystem culture and dubplate culture, rewinds and stuff. But when I used to hear dub it kind of made sense to me because I had an interest in jungle and then Chain Reaction was a very techno way of presenting that. It so much less edgy and rude, it's more slick.</p>\n<p>It's kind of a bit of both but what I'm trying to do is not just make a dub influenced track with someone shouting 'jah' in it - it's more to understand where it's coming from sound-wise.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4234/35731410331_45e10fbdc1_b.jpg\" alt=\"df\"></p>\n<p><em>A condensed version of Brownsword's studio.</em></p>\n<p><strong>I enjoyed your set at Happened a couple of months ago. Is the modular you brought to that typical of how you work in the studio?</strong></p>\n<p>Essentially it's about a third of the stuff that I have. Within the setup there's stuff that I use a lot, and stuff that I use less frequently. Because I wasn't going down a massively experimental drone and clicks route, what elements would I need to cover for the show?</p>\n<p>I think the danger with modular is it's a total addiction. At least ten percent of the stuff I've bought I've never used! You just have those moments of going &quot;oh cool I'll order that&quot; so actually you can focus it down quite quick. When I was in Berlin, the stuff I did with Felix, I had like six rows of modular in the apartment I was staying in but I only really took one row because it wasn't feasible to take more without it getting damaged. I actually got a lot out of taking less because you really focus in on what the bits that you've got can do and it kind of pushes you in a different direction.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/299389490&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>When you did the 'Elemnt' project with Felix that was a combination of both your gear?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, that as Felix using a lot of his stuff, like the Octatrack, Analogue Rhythm, that kind of thing and me with a small amount of modular, a sequencer, a synth and five or six other modules to go on the side of it. I think the good thing about that is the equipment really makes the sound. It's why I always really struggle with VSTs because the choice is just unending. It's a bit like with MP3s vs vinyl - where do you start? Sifting through presets is a total vibe-killer.</p>\n<p><em>Zwischenwelt is available <a href=\"http://www.easternblocrecords.com/drum-n-bassjungle/db1-zwischenwelt-2-x-lp-pre-order-23-06-17.html\">now</a>.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/324235381&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>The Aancient Vvars imprint is a confusing and illusory world. For anyone unfamiliar with the label, their Bandcamp is not much help, as anyone browsing through the Aancient Vvars collection will notice a few incongruous things. First, their releases look more like covers from drone metal albums, but sound nothing like them. Second, each release is some code-like modification of their name: '^​^​n​(​13nt v√årZ', '4​^​nc1ent VV4rz' and so on, making each impossible to remember or distinguish. Finally, each release is presented anonymously, and is instead just released by the label itself.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, their bio clears things up, explaining that the label roster have &quot;...since 1949 steadily increased their influence throughout China and the rest of the world. They have members at the very highest levels of the Chinese government but they are by nature anti-establishment, and are not an official government organisation.&quot; This level of deep obscurity brings to mind the cantankerous attitude of early Punk. As with John Lydon's unobliging interview manner — &quot;<em>we ain't no band, we're a company, simple</em>&quot; — Aancient Vvars cannot be understood and nor should they. It's a middle finger to respectability and marketability. After all, when did electronic music get so shiny all of a sudden anyway?</p>\n<p>As one would expect, this new release from <a href=\"http://tuuun.org/\">tuuun</a> is far from radio-friendly. Recorded in Stockholm's legendary EMS studio, the EP comprises two extended improvised workouts recorded live in one take, with no edits or overdubs. It takes a common trope from early techno production, limiting the instrumentation to just one synth and one drum machine. The result is an ear-splitting and anarchic exploration of sound extremities and form.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=85722713/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://aancientvvars.bandcamp.com/album/n-ient-77ar\">åån(IEnt 77ARΩ by Aancient Vvars</a></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>&quot;Klaus returns from a two and a half year hiatus from himself with just 11 minutes of music - that's an average of less than a second of music per day, which is frankly ridiculous&quot; begins the summary for TNM004.</p>\n<p>While it's true that dispatches from Nick Sigsworth's Tanum are few and far between, I don't think I'd have it any other way. Listening to the assorted 12&quot;s released on the imprint, its clear this is music which can't be rushed. Sigsworth's creative process seems to be about continuous reduction, stripping his tracks to their bare essentials and seeing how little he can get away with.</p>\n<p>'Cry Tuff' opens TNM004 with sullen dulcet tones and intermittent thrusts of low-end working together in downcast harmony. At a different tempo you could be forgiven for placing this kind of music in the lineage of labels like Chain Reaction; Sigsworth's textures and dubby and rich, clouded with gentle breezes of static and obscured field recordings. 'Bela' for example crackles like fireside kindling, distant vocals echoing in and out of focus. The effect is like driving at night; catching fragments of different scenes passing you by.</p>\n<p>This is undeniably bass-heavy music, yet it seems as if with each release Sigsworth travels further and further from his debut, which stood on the fringes of the dubstep scene, the skeletal 'Tusk' EP. The low-end on 'Gus' is case in point, scaled down so much it acts as a kind of physical sub-pressure, rather than discernible notes. Washes of ambience are similarly opaque, as echoing string textures dart like meteors across the night sky.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/336820143&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Riccardo Fantoni</em></p>\n<p>&quot;Klink! - an onomatopoetic word in Swedish that describes the sound of two metallic objects hitting each other, or the sound of a knife that strikes a glass to get the attention at a dinner party&quot;. For me, these two contexts represent very different meanings. The crash of two metallic objects is a harsh, violent noise, like the collision of two swords. This is the 'klink!' that the German industrialists Einstürzende Neubauten employed: a vicious, aggressive, mean sound. But tapping a glass at a dinner party before a speech is wholly different. It's a polite and dainty sound, made to quieten the room and calm the rabble.</p>\n<p>The latest compilation from Swedish imprint Stoscha falls somewhere between these two environments. Over six compiled pieces, the release manages to be both angry and accommodating. Take the opening piece from Petit Singe: a cacophonous piece that breaks and bursts like a building collapsing under its own weight. But at the same time, Stotscha do not take themselves too seriously. On 'Noordwal (lIl Lyfe)', a dance instructor guides the listener with aerobic stretches: &quot;stomach in, buttocks tight and... breath&quot;.</p>\n<p>Following the release of their highly conceptual '<a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/reviews/requiem-rip-me\">rip ME</a>' project, fans of this new label will be excited to see Petit Singe and Air Max '97 joining the roster. The compilation closes with a 10-minute clip exploring the sound of sex toys vibrating against each other in the appropriately titled, 'Five Vibration Intensities and Five Vibration Rhythms Give Diverse Pleasures'. If Neubauten ever soundtracked a porno, it might sound something like that.</p>\n<p>The full compilation is available on July 25th, but you can listen to Petit Singe's epic opener below:</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/333757025%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-TLvzz&color=0b0a0a&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Earlier this year, we were treated to Cevdet Erek's latest record, <em>Davul</em>. 'Davul' is the name of the novel drum that features as the centrepiece for this album. Over several years, Erek developed an idiosyncratic method of playing, using a large soft mallet alongside various smaller implements to beat and distort the skin of the drum. The skin is also tuned lower than normal, giving that bouncing-ball effect as the mallet bounces on the surface. Listening to this record, with its brooding overtones and apocalyptic sound, it may surprise you to find that the Davul is an instrument used for celebration too. When we spoke to Erek earlier in the month, he explained:</p>\n<p>&quot;<em>This type of drum is traditionally used in dances, weddings and any kind of celebration or announcement (like wake-up time for Ramadan fasting) as well. That’s not what I am doing. The technique that I use is based on the traditional usage, but I used it as just a drum and flowed with it. There are lots of other drumming or pulse based influences on what I do: any other traditional culture of rhythm with bass drums, and details that I’ve been influenced by for many years; from Balcanic to African, from Brazilian to Central Asian shamanic cultures from elsewhere to Japanese/Korean traditional drumming, but also lots from drummers from recent decades, too. So: I take a drum and start walking with it. The past and current paths shape the sound.</em>&quot;</p>\n<p><em>Davul</em> is an interesting record, if only for its deceptive simplicity. There are only seven improvised pieces, culled from hours of solo drum improvisations recorded over two days in Berlin, with no overdubs or edits. Erek's explanation of this decision is clear: &quot;just play, improvise and record.&quot; And although this may have a spur-of-the-moment charm to it, the truth is, a lot of preparation went into those two days of recording. Putting to one side the practicing hours, Erek also experimented with unusual microphone placements and moving around the studio with the Davul to give the auditory illusion that there many players in the room at once.</p>\n<p>The result is an eery and impressive record. Erek eclectic interest in genres from, &quot;techno to grindcore to bass cultures and sheer noise music&quot; comes through, even on a record with but one instrument. As Erek himself explains, &quot;some certain aesthetics are affected by hundreds of inputs from all around the world.&quot; However, Turkish percussive music is sadly not well known or heard often today. To provide some context for this album, we asked Cevdet to mix some essential influences of traditional and contemporary drum music and to mix it with some his drumming and remixing. Listen below.</p>\n<p><em>Please note that we could not upload this mix to Mixcloud as it is banned in Turkey.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist:</strong></p>\n<p>İster 1 - Yarkın Türk Ritm Grubu [Kalan Müzik]<br>\nRebonds B - Iannis Xenakis (performed by Christoph Sietzen) [Genuine]<br>\n128.5 - Burnt Friedman, Jaki Liebzeit [Nonplace]<br>\nKabak Tatlısı - Okay Temiz [Ada Müzik ]<br>\nKış Kış - Nekropsi [A.K.

    "content": "<p>In its original form, <em>Cannibal Mécanique</em> has been around since 2014. Constructed by multimedia artist Victoria Keddie, the piece began life as a data-moshed, psychedelic amalgamation of electronic music, choreography and lo-fi VHS visual manipulations performed at New York's Museum of Art &amp; Design.</p>\n<p>Recently, Angus Tarnawsky's In Context Music imprint took it upon themselves to issue a reworked version of the audio components of <em>Cannibal Mécanique</em> on a limited series of 7&quot; lathe records. ICM saw a bit of a hiatus cross 2016, so it's great to see them back in force, releasing five new works of consistently high quality across this year.</p>\n<p>This latest offering is littered with buzzing, amp-driven distortions and wild, screeching tape echoes, like a Rrose release only available on a 1960's TV set. Both sides seem to be alterations on the same theme, stuttered sine-wave techno and de-saturated, Sähkö reminiscent modulations both recurring textures.</p>\n<p>Keddie's a-side sees dusty overdrive resonances tremoloing alongside contorted dial-tones, while the b-side feels like a much subdued, basement-dwelling relative. Grainy beaters and stalled-engine sound design make for a brooding, hypnotic listen, developing slowly to a malfunctioned close.</p>\n<p>In its lathe cut form at least, <em>Cannibal Mécanique</em> calls to mind Francis Ford Coppola's wire-tap thriller, <em>The Conversation</em> for me.  Not least for the static-laced, in-and-out-of-focus feel it maintains, but also for the fact both sides build to disconcerting climaxes, leaving the listener unnerved and disoriented.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/128609343&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Ambient is something we cover quite a bit at Stray Landings, yet often it comes packaged as part of something wider; an interlude alongside more beatific music or an aside to a more aggressive central project. London based Alex Ives, aka Specimens however seems to be fully committed to the genre.</p>\n<p>Following his debut cassette, 'II', on Shimmering Moods Records in 2015, Ives released the <em>Sculptures</em> LP last year, a conflicted, tension-fraught journey through warped orchestral timbres and manipulated field records.</p>\n<p>The release also made up the debut album Ives' label, First Terrace Records, which he co-runs with close friend Joe Summers. &quot;To be honest, starting a label was something I was pretty convinced I would never do&quot; he begins when asked about the label's origins. &quot;Sometime in mid-2016 I started to think it would be nice to put together and release some of the artists that had shaped my listening over the last few years. Initially I thought about just doing a big compilation LP of ambient/drone/noise artists; the idea of a full blown label was a bit daunting at the time. I kept the ideas largely to myself initially, but one evening when chatting with Joe, he put the idea into my head that doing something a little more substantial could be better.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Not long after this Joe and I started doing a radio show together. I thought it would be nice to release some of the smaller artists from the show as a yearly compilation. I approached Joe to see if he would be up for working on the compilations with me. At that stage I figured I’d work on doing albums alone, and do compilations with Joe. I can be a bit of a control freak sometimes and if I have an idea I’m not always that keen to compromise! However, Joe is one of the few people I could envisage doing this with and very quickly after chatting about doing the compilations with him it was clear he not only shared my vision for what the label could be as a whole but had some cool ideas that really excited me. Between the two of us we started planning ideas for releases and worked together on solidifying what First Terrace Records would come to represent.&quot;</p>\n<p>Succeeding the <em>Sculptures</em> LP and the first of their compilation series, Summer and Ives released <em>Sunday Songs</em> last month by The Beacon Sound Choir. <em>Sunday Songs</em> is a little different from most records I encounter. The choir was rallied together by Peter Broderick, consisting of 35 members, all with varying degrees of experience. Recorded in a record shop in Portland, Oregon, <em>Sunday Songs</em> is peppered with the occasional live misnomer; such as on 'Elongated Easter Egg' which closes with the group breaking into chat, as if recorded without their knowledge. The effect is to put you right in the heart of the recording; an intimate and personal experience. &quot;I came across The Beacon Sound Choir last year&quot; Ives offers when quizzed about the record's origins. &quot;We were putting together ideas for one of our radio shows and Joe played me this really cool one-sided gold 10”. It was just two tracks of vocal drones, released through the wonderful Infinite Greyscale label. I went home and ordered a copy that day and it was by far the best thing I heard all year.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;I was chatting with Joe about artists we wanted to work with on First Terrace; at the top of our list was Beacon Sound Choir. To our knowledge however the choir was over and Peter [Broderick] had since moved away from Portland. We were resigned to the fact that we wouldn’t be able to do a record in the immediate future but maybe we should send a speculative email just stating how much we loved the 10” and if they ever got back together we would love to do something with them. To both our surprise (and joy), Peter got back to us within a day with a lovely email and sent us a bunch of music. Even though the choir was indeed on indefinite hiatus, Peter had a selection of songs which were recorded previously. He seemed pretty excited about releasing the music and had even mixed and laid out the tracks in an order he felt worked. Joe and I were absolutely thrilled what he sent over was as good as the tracks we’d previously heard and decided pretty quickly that we had to do this record!&quot;</p>\n<p>Given the LP's release last month, we decided to invite Ives to contribute to our podcast series, providing what he terms &quot;a snapshot across my listening spectrum&quot;.  Alongside the expected ambient and neoclassical offerings from the likes of Hauschka and Lawrence English, there are also more beatific elements such as Beatrice Dillon's tape-echo head-spinner, 'Curl' or Matthew Herbert's jazz-inflected House classic, 'I hadn't Known (I Only Heard)'.</p>\n<p>Stream the mix below and keep an eye on First Terrace Records' <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/firstterracerecords/\">Facebook page</a> for more updates.

    "content": "<p>Looking through the discography of Samuel Wood, aka Sam KDC, his releases seem to get exponentially slower and darker as time goes on. Cutting his teeth in the D&amp;B world around 2010 with atmospheric 170 BPM releases on the likes of 31 Records and DSM, the last few years has seen Wood's sound slow to grinding, cavern dwelling ambience on albums like <em>Cycles of Perspective</em> and <em>KVLTVR</em>.</p>\n<p>Recently, Berlin based label Horo announced a new project from Wood, entitled Ourea, alongside Japanese artist Maiko Okimoto. Okimoto's musical history appears to have followed similar path, providing vocals for D&amp;B producers like ENA and Naibu under the alias Key MC. Recently, Okimoto began a new project, Lemna. Focused on leftfield techno, her live show will premiere in Berlin's monolithic Kraftwerk building as part of Berlin Atonal later this year.</p>\n<p>Okimoto and Wood's EP together is entitled 'Ourea I’, due for release August 25. Even without reading their biographies, it wouldn't take much guesswork to establish the release was the efforts of two D&amp;B producers turning their hand to techno. The release is littered with shuffled poly-rhythms and showcases the razor-sharp production those who have spent some time working with fast-paced dance music seem to master better than anyone. 'Deception at Mekone' rumbles beneath quivering metallic textures while 'Dysnomia' clatters forth, blackened atmospherics undulating beneath contorted rhythms and UFO modulations.</p>\n<p>Then there is 'Adamantine Sickle', easing out resonances and distorted thuds in a dense, brooding offering to early hours warehouse techno.

    "content": "<p>De La Soul's debut masterpiece <em>3 Feet High and Rising</em> includes a 12-second sample from the Turtles' 1969 song, 'You Showed Me' in the interlude skit, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBlcJZc85zg\">'Transmitting Live From Mars'</a>. Upon hearing the sample in 1991, Mark Volman of the Turtles successfully sued De La Soul for an eye-watering $1.7 million in a case settled outside of court. Speaking to the L.A Times, Volman said, &quot;sampling is just a longer term for theft. Anybody who can honesty say sampling is some sort of creativity has never done anything creative.&quot; Volman is apparently deaf to irony, since 'You Showed Me' is actually a cover version of a song written by Roger McGuinn and Gene Clark of the Byrds.</p>\n<p>He's also just plain wrong. The sheer amount of creative music that has been spawned since then is staggering. Even to put the Golden Age of Hip-Hip to one side, we've had Plunderphonics, Chopped &amp; Screwed, Breakcore and a more recent fascination with sound collage in the Internet Age. So what do we make of sampling today? Where can it go? Is 'originality' important? Does it even exist? This month, we spoke with two contemporary producers and artists working with samples — Dane Law and Natasha Lall — to answer these questions and more.</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist:</strong></p>\n<p>Legacy Support - Akzidenz [Unreleased]<br>\nVelocity - John Oswald [Avant]<br>\nUnited In Dance - Dane Law [Quantum Natives]<br>\nWhat I've Done Wrong - 111x [Unreleased]<br>\nCheer Chat Plunderphonics - Natasha Lall [Unreleased]<br>\nStraight Outta Compton (MC DSP Mix)- Kid606 [V/Vm Test Records]<br>\nVariations For A Door And A Sigh - Pierre Henry [Limelight] <br></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&light=1&feed=%2FResonance%2Fstray-landings-july-2017-sampling-censored%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Kouichirou Tue Nakai.</em></p>\n<p>When I was a kid I remember catching the end of that episode of Goosebumps where a kit ant-farm goes haywire. The ants grow to the size of large buildings and watch the humans trapped in their houses, in the kind of absurdist role-reversal which is terrifying when you're six. Maybe it's the cover art playing tricks on me, or maybe it's the apocalypse-horror soundscapes, but the latest dispatch from the Voyder collective brought this to mind.</p>\n<p>Written by French producer Francis Balthazar operating under the name Cancer, <em>Presque Rien</em> is in many ways typical of what I've come to expect from Voyder; nuclear armageddon hip-hop and intergalactic distortions work in brain-scrambling contortions.</p>\n<p>Although separated into digestible track lengths, the album is intended to be listened to in one sitting, each track leading into the next with little respite given from the crushing circuit bent electronics. Furthermore there are a number of remixes by Balthazar included on the LP, making the listening experience something like attending one of his live shows, not least for the improvised, freeform feel it possesses.</p>\n<p>Of these dissections, ‘Bouche Trou’ is one of the most memorable; bone-rattling abstractions and grunting, swaggered rhythms working together in distorted chaos. 'Thunder5' is another of the release's most intense contributions, strained dial-tones and plummeting blasts of low-end thud to a fro, like if Death Grips had gone out for a big one at the late (great) Plastic People.</p>\n<p>Although they're only five releases deep, if there's one thing I've learnt about Voyder, it's that they only like waveforms which look like a city broker's payday cigar. Any breaks or dynamics are compressed to oblivion, resulting in tracks which are above all else, <em>loud</em>. Balthazar then, is a pretty ideal fit for Voyder, presenting a release which assaults the eardrums with little regard for the long term damage it might cause. Glorious.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/339940858&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Anna Drvnik.</em></p>\n<p>Entering the town of Norberg can be a surreal experience. Not least because it carries some of the enigmatic mystique of David Lynch's fictional town, <em>Twin Peaks</em>. Like Twin Peaks, Norberg is sat in the middle of a forgotten municipality, surrounded by fir trees, silent lakes and humdrum local businesses. Where the automatic lawnmowers outnumber residents and everything seems to be permanently closed. Its location is also remote enough to deter any softcore fans. If you're not lucky enough to hitch a ride in Maria W Horn's famous Volvo, it typically takes two buses and two trains to arrive from Stockholm. Reflecting on the creation of his fictional setting, Lynch once explained that, &quot;in a town like Twin Peaks, no-one is innocent&quot;. That certainly feels true at Norberg. Beneath its sleepy suburbia, there is a mischievous underbelly. And once a year, Norberg reveals its alter-ego with strobes, gabba and lolz.</p>\n<p>First, a few words on the venues of Norberg, because they are by no means typical. At the centre, you have Mimer (pictured above): an ex-ore mine of colossal proportions. But rather than roaming around in its shadowed corners, you explore across shaky staircases and precarious planks. During the noisier sets, you have to cling to the safety rails to stop yourself from falling. The venue is so hazardous that alcohol and dancing are prohibited and (so I heard) any acts that are &quot;too banging&quot;. Next, Kraftwerk: a venue that once housed a steam engine used for operating the mining processes in the area. Kraftwerk acts like a kind of techno-Tardis. From the outside, it looks like a venue for country music and line dancing. Inside, it's a steely power station. Dubbed 'Barnhain' by Manni Dee.</p>\n<p>The 303 stage is interesting in so much as it began as a guerrilla stage in the campsite. Once it had outgrown its shell, 303 was brought in-house, supplying the summer jams as the primary outdoor venue. The campsite now instead hosts an upgraded '727' tent. You can go there after the 'official' music has ended and listen to rogue DJs blast out jungle sets (hearing jungle abroad is the only time I ever feel national pride). There is even the 'Really Open Stage', in which punters are encouraged to jam on analogue gear to passers by. Finally, you can take a tiny historic train two kilometers through the forest to a wooden workshop to watch a showcase from Stockholm's EMS.</p>\n<p>As I collected my wristband, I was mistaken as a journalist from VICE. Almost immediately I heard a hushed voice behind me, &quot;...for fucksake, VICE are here...&quot;. Beyond this amusing miscommunication, I began to feel guilty for my presence. Because Norberg Festival is indeed very precious. Despite running for nearly two decades, it continues to contain under 1000 attendees per year, with no corporate sponsorship at all as far as I could see. And so it should remain. There's an undeniable delight in having such great music located within a small, obscure radius of the world.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4321/36185569361_69d617b718_b.jpg\" alt=\"dav\">\n<em>Sarah Davachi. Photo by Vlad Brateanu.</em></p>\n<p>Still, you can't gate-keep a festival. Especially one this good. In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8vU-I6F0w\">the words of Mad Mike</a>, &quot;the true essence of techno music is that everybody can come to the party&quot;. Indeed, the feeling of inclusivity is part of the reason why Norberg is precious in the first place. The gender balance in particular is better than any festival I have seen before. It would not be right to start policing its attendees to a subset of those cool enough to be 'in the know'. Despite my wobble, I remain convinced that everyone should get to Norberg one year. It should be on the fucking NHS.</p>\n<p>Part of Norberg's charm comes from its staff, 100% of whom are volunteers and many are returning veterans of the festival. This is no small feat since the volunteer time at Norberg comes to around seven days of unpaid work. They exchange this labour for shelter, free vegan meals and drinks. The volunteer set-up brings with it an unspoken camaraderie. I heard one person describing it as being in the middle of one's own personal Truman Show. Everyone seems to know everyone and there are no clear celebrity hierarchies, nor divides between punters and artists. I talked A.I with Daniel M Karlsson, shared cigarettes with Ikonika and danced with beautiful queers. It was genuinely touching. Only my dire British cynicism could be rattled by such friendliness. O brave new world, that has such people in it!</p>\n<p>Another impressive aspect of a festival this small is its embrace of opposites. At one point, we had Benjamin Noys speaking on accelerationist music and the dangers of techno-futurism — <em>Shouldn't we be suspicious about the nascent obsession with YouTube sound collage and MacBook aesthetics?</em> — This talk was right next door to a 'Radical Dance &amp; Movement', within a participatory group circle. After all, there is nothing wrong with being a bit <em>Rainbow Rhythms</em> from time to time... On Friday night, I had Pharmakon scream obscenities an inch away from my face as she stared into my eyes. The next morning, a group yoga session took place in a local garden. One night, I am skipping around with gun-fingers to a happy hardcore set. The next evening, I am staring into the abyss during a tribute show to Arthur Russell.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4316/36278026406_79dbb48324_b.jpg\" alt=\"v\">\n<em>Photo by Vlad Brateanu.</em></p>\n<p>The long daylight hours in Norberg can also trip you out. A day in Norberg lasts on average over 17 hours. This makes the woodland afterparties an evermore surreal experience. Go for an early morning swim in the idyllic lakes, frolic on dunes of sawdust or snort Ketamine in an abandoned tractor. Whatever you fancy.</p>\n<p>There are two (almost contradictory) facets to Norberg. On the one hand, Norberg is immediately welcoming. Beatrice Dillon's set in particular accommodated the audience, with seductive dub grooves. 111X also blasted 90s pop hooks over dancehall beats and sound effects. There were artist talks, film screenings and tours of the mine to provide context to the weekend. Moreover, the camaraderie of the volunteers, the hodgepodge of artists &amp; punters, and the picturesque scenery make this feel more like a summercamp than a music festival. But some of the music inside the venues requires serious consideration and patience. In Kraftwerk (Coucou Chloe, KP Transmission, Ikonika), I could feel my ear drums rattling around my head. At times, the smoke machines were enough to make me forget where I was. In Mimer, ambient sets from Sarah Davachi and Anna von Hausswolff brought my heart-rate dangerously low. There was even naked interpretative dance in clay and Shibari bondage art. It was challenging at all the right moments.</p>\n<p>Saturday delivered the festival with the ending it deserves. With an accelerating exit velocity, we were treated to the SIREN DJs, EVOL and Manni Dee &amp; Ewa Justka. SIREN occupied the 303 stage in its final hours, with a flawless selection of floor-fillers: from Claro Intelecto to Shed. You could also bliss out to the dreamlike twists and turns of Sci-Fi songwriter Moonbow. EVOL delivered an abstract and mesmerising visual show. Here, the performance explored that most basic of elemental subjects: sound waves. Pure square-, triangle-, and sine-waves materialised against Mimer's titanic walls. It was like watching fireworks in Flatland.</p>\n<p>I don't really want to talk about Manni Dee &amp; Ewa Justka's set. The primary use of Justka's 'Motherfucker' machine should give you some idea of their basic intention. Climaxing to a tempo of 300bpm (or higher), the overdriven kicks began to lose their distinction. The stroboscopes became fast enough to elicit hallucinations and my brain began to shut down. It completely destroyed me. After the chaos is over, the volunteers run their own party. No less debauched than the previous nights, the evening is complete with guest DJ slots, live sets and free alcohol.</p>\n<p>I'm not saying it's the best festival in the world, but it is the best festival in the world.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4308/36278646146_94ce5d270d_h.jpg\" alt=\"b\"></p>\n",

    "content": "<p><em>Photos by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ftneProd/\">FTNE Prod.</a></em></p>\n<p>Jesse Kuyé aka J.Tijn's techno rips up dancefloors like a chainsaw through a mattress. His industrialised, no frills drum tracks have been released everywhere from Untold's Pennyroyal imprint to Dubai based Bedouin, where his most recent EP,  'Sliema Sixteen' found its home.</p>\n<p>An undulating and disoriented four tracker, the release hints at a different side to Kuyé's productions, most notably with 'Sludge'. The track is peppered with the kind of ricocheting snares you'd expect to find in a Marxman tune, providing a rugged slab of stuttered bassweight closer to grime than anything else. This is perhaps not surprising, as Kuyé actually began his forays into production making grime, and later dubstep. Last year he released several works through 'In An Instant', a label he founded which seems focussed on styles which break out of the usual J.Tijn blueprint.</p>\n<p>Recently, Kuyé also featured on West Norwood Cassette Library's third 'We Are Family' EP. WNCL Recordings seems to be another outlet for Kuyé to explore styles which are a little outside of his usual mould, delivering several fuzzed-out house offerings. We decided to catch up with him after one of his shifts at Container Records, a Brixton based record store he works at to discuss his recent releases, reggae soundsystems and making grime on a Playstation.</p>\n<p><strong>I enjoyed your recent EP for Bedouin. I keep seeing the label and Salem [Rashid] described as 'elusive' and that kind of thing. I wanted to ask what your experience working with him has been like...</strong></p>\n<p>I've never met him in person so I can understand why people might say that. Things have taken long but it's been smooth. He'll email me like with this particular one, saying I've saved this catalogue for you; try and work on something. I kept on making stuff and communicating over email until it was ready. I wouldn't say he's shady over email or anything!</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/316050460&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I found it funny because if someone's just not based where you are or aren't really brash with PR then they often get described in those terms.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, I think it says more about how in your face everyone else is when you compare it to something that's just going along. He's not trying to hide it or anything, he's just getting on with his life and doing his label. I don't think he's putting any effort into trying to come across in that way at all.</p>\n<p><strong>It's your second release on the label right?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah the first one was kind of the same. He just emailed me saying &quot;hey man, this is my label - I've done this and this, I'd love to do a release&quot;. I knew the label already so I was really happy about it. I didn't have the tunes already he just wanted me to do something. I sent him what I did have and I think he picked one or two of them. I carried on making stuff and when he'd got another two it was done.</p>\n<p>It's kind of similar to how things run with WNCL, I'll send over a few tracks and then Bob [Bhamra] will pick things he likes until it's finished.</p>\n<p><strong>I wanted to mention WNCL because you were on the 'We Are Family' release recently. Tell us a bit about the 'Decimated' series - they're all released through Bob right?</strong></p>\n<p>They aren't all released, but all the ones that have come out are on WNCL. They're just like distorted drum tracks. The name comes from the plugin I used called 'Decimort'. I kept making similar stuff, there was maybe four or six of them. Number four came out on WNCL and then whenever I made a tune in that vein afterwards I just called it decimated. I think the one that just came out on 'We Are Family' was slightly different because Bob specifically asked me to make a decimated tune for that. That's the only one I'd say I started off knowing what I wanted to do before.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/334910515&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>It's nice having one of those on each of your WNCL EPs because those releases tend to be a bit more melodic than your other output. It's nice to have a tearout drum track to contrast the rest with.</strong></p>\n<p>When I met Bob we kind of shared similar tastes but we didn't connect through techno. I heard some of the first releases like the Knowing Looks release. WNCL weren't really putting out techno at that time. It was still kind of inline with dubstep, or post-dubstep if you want.</p>\n<p>It was kind of similar to what I was doing at the time so I just hit Bob up on Soundcloud and would send him stuff every now and again. His message was like &quot;there's nothing here that I want to put out, but I'm into this style so keep sending me stuff and we'll get there.&quot; It took ages but we got there. I think because of the way I met Bob and the stuff he was putting out, I have always been more inclined to send him the melodic stuff.</p>\n<p>Say if it was Bedouin; I wouldn't even bother. Some of the things that have come out on WNCL, I wouldn't have even shown to any other labels because I know what they're after, and it's not house.</p>\n<p>With most of the labels I've released on it's generally only been once, but with WNCL it's something that I want to keep going. As long as I'm releasing music I will still try and put EPs out with him. The release is called 'We Are Family' and it kind of is like that. All the artists that I've met from WNCL; we always get along well, it's always been cool and you meet people through it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4357/36494436261_c73bcb8a38_b.jpg\" alt=\"Tijn\"></p>\n<p><strong>I read you started out producing grime. How far along that path did you get?</strong></p>\n<p>I was just shit man! (Laughs). The first grime tunes I made was on <em>Music</em>, not even <em>Music 2000</em> but <em>Music</em> on Playstation. Even when I was doing it, the game was already old. So even in 2001/2002 when I was making it, it was still not levels compared to what was going on at the time.</p>\n<p><strong>Quite a lot of people started out like that though - I remember reading Ruff Sqwad used <em>Music</em>.</strong></p>\n<p>But they were using <em>Music 2000</em> where you could sample! I wasn't using that I was just doing it with the preset stuff. There were some ideas that were alright but none were anything worth showing to a label. I was like ten or eleven.</p>\n<p>I stopped throughout secondary school until year ten, when I got hold of Fruity Loops. There was a grime tune called 'Top Producer'. A lot of producers also MCing, and they were just talking about production and how good they are and this kind of stuff. Skepta mentioned Fruity Loops 3; I'd never heard of it and didn't know anything about it but because he was talking about this program I was like I'm getting that! I went on Limewire and got my Fruity Loops.</p>\n<p>I was still making grime then as well, but by this time I'd started to hear dubstep. I wouldn't say I consciously decided to stop making grime and start making dubstep but it was kind of like as the tunes got better; more detailed and with more sound design, they kind of became more dubstep. At the time the gap between grime and dubstep wasn't so big. It was literally a case of grime being grime, and dubstep being not adult-grime, but grime with a bit more production on it and development. It happened quite naturally like that.</p>\n<p><strong>I was listening to some of your In An Instant stuff which reminds me more of the grime thing... What's the plan with that label?</strong></p>\n<p>This is the thing; it's definitely stuff I wouldn't send to other labels. There's no real plan though. When I did the first record, I wasn't really thinking I'm going to start a label, I just wanted to do a release and then maybe another if it went alright. I just wanted to see how it goes. The first one went ok but I don't think I handled it right.</p>\n<p>I'm kind of in two minds about whether to do another one or just start an actual label and do things right. We'll see; there's music that I want to put out but it might just be better to put it out on other labels.</p>\n<p><strong>What would put you off sending say, the jungle tunes on <em>Drag &amp; Drop</em> for example to another label?</strong></p>\n<p>I think with those sort of tunes; it's like with other labels there's always tunes that are priority for me. I don't want to send a label like twenty tunes to go through, it's better to send five or six. Using Bedouin as an example, there's going to be five or six more suitable tunes than the jungle ones. So it's not that I don't want to send it, it's just I know it wouldn't make the final cut. When I'm sending tunes, the more leftfield or less-techno ones kind of get patched off even though they're the ones I like the most; things that are a bit different and don't fit into the techno blueprint.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/324410663&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>It's weird you think about it like that, even though you might prefer the less-techno style tracks.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, I think with the whole J.Tijn project in itself; it was a little offshoot. I was never expecting to do any gigs or releases. I wanted a name for this stuff that doesn't sound like teenage London music. I needed a foreign name so I asked some of my Dutch or Belgian friends; that's where the name comes from. It doesn't mean anything, Tijn is just a Dutch name, that's it! I think it's actually a first name, it's not even a surname at all (laughs).</p>\n<p>Mentally, J.Tijn is still a very particular group of tunes. Anything that's more UK sounding, I don't really have a name for it and I don't really associate it with J.Tijn.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4344/36235925710_b8c5044457_b.jpg\" alt=\"as\"></p>\n<p><strong>You're from Brighton originally right?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah that's where I was born. I lived there til I was ten so I've been in London for most of my life.</p>\n<p><strong>I was going to ask if you'd got involved in the music scene down there but at the age of ten maybe not!</strong></p>\n<p>Not personally, but I was around it because my dad was involved in the music scene when we were down there. He was part of a soundsystem. I was around music and the people that were in the scene around that time. They were like 'uncle whatsit' or whatever. That was all hip-hop, a little bit of D&amp;B but mostly a reggae soundsystem. My dad was the selector, literally like a reggae DJ for that soundsystem. That was years and years ago though when I was small small. There were producers around, other MCs, other sound people.</p>\n<p><strong>And you've been working at Container Records since January?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah I did my first shift in December but they were closed over Christmas then I came back after that.</p>\n<p><strong>Is it your first time working in a record store?</strong></p>\n<p>No, I worked in Uptown Records in Soho from like 2008 to 2010 or '11. We used to sell grime, dubstep, bassline, a little bit of hip hop and then house upstairs. They were fun days; that was where I learnt everything. Not music-wise or production-wise but just in terms of how the scene works.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/334006754&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I was going to ask, how has it changed your perspective in terms of releasing music?</strong></p>\n<p>I think being at the record shop, the thing that I learnt the most wasn't the techniques but just about marketing and how important it is. I would hear people talking about stuff like &quot;this guy is no good because he's releasing all the time so no-one buys it.&quot; Little things like that because, going into it I would have thought it was good to just constantly flood it all the time.</p>\n<p>Even things like going on radio; I remember getting told like &quot;if you do this DJ thing, if you want to DJ in clubs and get gigs, stay off the radio, don't get a weekly radio show.&quot; Or if you want a radio show don't be playing out in clubs all the time. Even things like taking on remixes; don't do too many of them. Just try and remix the stuff that you think is a good move.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you turn down a lot of work like that?</strong></p>\n<p>To be honest I get too many offers for remixes, that's the truth. But when I need money, if someone offers me a remix and I think I can do something with it I'll just take it. If I need dough I'm doing it (laughs). In an ideal world I'd be a lot more selective about it. I enjoy doing it as well so I have to kind of restrict myself, and try and keep it closed to some degree, because if I wanted to I could do a remix every month without trouble. There's obviously a limit though to how much you want floating around.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4383/35758798333_4ac0e30b06_b.jpg\" alt=\"tijn\"></p>\n<p><strong>Also going back to what you were saying about marketing - if you were going to take In An Instant further or setup something new, do you think you'd approach that differently?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, definitely, 100%. I think being in the record shop - when it came to starting a label I already knew what I had to do. I knew the process; I knew about distributors and the order things go in. I knew about pricing and stuff like that. Even in more ways than I could probably describe consciously, when I came to doing a record label I wasn't in unknown territory. I always knew what I had to do it was just a question of time and money. I think without working in the shop it would have been a total mystery. I would have had to have asked people what the fuck's going on.</p>\n<p>You can do everything right and it still doesn't always work; it's a gamble at the end of the day. What's different about when I was in the record shop in Soho to now is that you had distributors, but there was a large quantity of stuff that was sale or return. People would drive around themselves. Nowadays you don't really find that. Most of the sale or return stuff that we've got in Container, it's people's collections not their product. It's second hand records  from people's collections that they've put out to sell. When I was in Uptown, you'd always have producers coming round with a box of their release. &quot;Here's 25, just pay me for what you sell, I'll be back in a month&quot;. I think you don't really get that so much now.</p>\n<p><strong>Is it weird being in a position where someone could come and buy one of your own records direct from you?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah it is weird, it's nice though! It's happened a couple of times. I always try and tell them (laughs). I wouldn't tell them till after they've paid for it, because imagine if you went in a record shop and you were looking through and someone was like &quot;oh, that's mine&quot;; you'd kind of feel like you have to buy it. How can a man tell you it's his record then you listen to it and put it back? I try not to influence that!</p>\n<p><strong>And what's next in terms of releases?</strong></p>\n<p>I've got a tune coming out on a various artists compilation, which is coming out on a label called Lost Soul Enterprises. They're some guys in New York, I played for them last year. They're pushing like wave, acid, industrial techno. It's a three part compilation, but the records are staggered so the'll be one out end of August, one beginning of September and then the third one's out at the end of September. I'm on the third one. Richard P's on there, Vapauteen, Motiv-A and a couple of others.</p>\n<p>I'm also writing a toolkit thing for WNCL. Two minute tunes; third deck tunes. It'll be six a side on a 10&quot;. There's drum tracks which are like just jungle drums, there's ambient stuff and little short techno loops, loads of just tools basically. I think that's the first project where I've had a brief and written to it.  I've done enough for it but because there's other stuff ready I'm just going to keep writing for it so we can get the best twelve.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/337018984&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>It's hard to believe that Calum Gunn's Conditional imprint has been running for less than two years. In that time, the label have produced a flurry of impressive releases. From Ewa Justka's <em>Efhksjerfbeskj</em> to rkss' <em>Brostep in the Style of Florian Hecker</em>, Conditional specialise in championing stripped-back, abstract synth-noise for cassette. Their aesthetic carries part of that bedroom DIY fun that any good electronic music should have. Experimentation without the chin-stroking, or IDM without the fanfare.</p>\n<p>Their latest release, <em>Tan Object</em>, comes from Sebastian Camens, a name which may sound familiar from the very first Conditional release,\n<em>Slant Deviations</em>. On <em>Tan Object</em>, Camens takes a synth patch as far as it will go. Over 47 minutes, every nook and cranny of a fuzzy waveform is scrutinised. You come to intimately know its contours; its limits; its deficiencies. It's like Object-Oriented Ontology for fans of Vangelis. Such an approach to music captures what John Cage deemed as the true essence of minimalism: “Simultaneously, the attentive listener is struck by the simplicity of action and by the complexity of the sound”.</p>\n<p>Unlike the sustained monolith of <em>Tan Object</em>, Camen's mix for us is a dizzying, whistle-stop tour of his influences on this record. Take a look at the towering 90-piece tracklist below, which looks (and sounds) more like a Plunderphonic workout than any mix I've heard lately. Find breakbeat, rave, noise, gabba and abrasive synths of death. It's like flicking through the scattered iTunes library of a obsessive historian of extremist computer music.

    "content": "<p>Stockholm-based W-I, or 'Worldwide International', have been releasing digital obscurities since late-2014.  Founded by Oli XL, the label is well-versed in the kind of bugged-out takes on grime and trap we have seen from labels like PAN and Staycore in recent years. Yet there is also a more tender side to the imprint.</p>\n<p>This dichotomy is well explored on their latest EP, 'Worldwide Recycle Service 02'. There's a taste of V/Vm to the series; it sees an assortment of artists armed with stems for W-I's entire catalogue, to do with what they will. This could mean remixing a single track, or it could mean frankensteining components from several works. For this edition, Oli XL contributes a track alongside Celyn June, N1L &amp; Kablam.</p>\n<p>Throughout the release there is a heavily sedated atmosphere. Take Kablam's 'Mouthing (Recycled)', pitting acid-washed synth textures against barrages of jagged-edged percussion, high-sheen vocals rupturing through the mist like a summer blaze through the trees. N1L's 'Sub-Zero' deploys similar tactics, anime-style dulcet tones and tight reverberation building to a subatomic drop, as thudding kicks and aqueous bass textures explore cavernous settings.</p>\n<p>Then there is Celyn June's offering, 'Drivers', calling to mind the stoner ambient of Yves Tumor's <em>Serpent Music</em> LP from earlier this year. Faded orchestral timbres and quayside sound-design work together cautiously. The offering could soundtrack a dream sequence in one of the early seasons of The Sopranos; spaced-out and unsettled, yet there are signs of familiar settings in the backdrop (I'm thinking of the one where Tony gets diarrhoea and talks to a fish).</p>\n<p>Oli XL seeks to shake things up as the EP comes to a close. 'Rogue Idiot Pt.2' is a vicious, stripped back rhythmic exertion, stuttered kicks and diced up vocals showing something in common with footwork's approach to production as much as anything else. As the track comes to a close it begins to stumble over itself, staggering to a discordant close, Radiophonic Workshop style.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/342134217&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>The name ‘EMS’ seems to crop up a lot these days. The historic studio is famed for its pioneering work in sound art and ‘text-sound’: some of the earliest examples of experimental electronic music owe EMS for their creation. But a sizeable chunk of the most exciting music from 2017 also seems to have been made here. From <a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/interviews/irl-jesse-osborne-lanthier-interview\">Jesse Osborne-Lanthier</a> to <a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/reviews/aan-ient-77arw\">tuuun</a> to <a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/news/premiere-punctum-glory-bitch\">Punctum</a>, they have all seemed to have some of that EMS magic brush off on recent releases.</p>\n<p>So what is it about EMS that is so special? Well, on a superficial level, it houses some classic vintage synthesisers, most notably the Buchla. But much, much more important is the social infrastructure that underpins the space. Thanks to 100 years of Swedish Socialism, anyone can book time to use the equipment, sign up to classes, and blossom as an electronic musician. As Daniel M Karlsson wrote, the studio stands as “a monument to common ownership guarded from those who would seek to tear it down on principal”. But how did we get here from the avant-garde studio of the 60s? What did we do to deserve this? What is text-sound anyway?</p>\n<p>In this very special episode of Stray Landings FM, we went to EMS to speak with the director of the studio, Mats Lindström, and contemporary EMS composer, Maria W Horn about its history, aesthetics and politics. Listen below.</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist:</strong></p>\n<p>Legacy Support - Akzidenz [Unreleased] <br>\nÅngermanländska Bilder - Maria W Horn [Forthcoming, XKatedral/Portals] <br>\nEMS On Its Own - Knut Wiggen [Unreleased] <br>\nSpirit of Ecstasy, Racing Car Opera - Åke Hodell [Fylkingen Records] <br>\nDon’t Make Me Leave My Car - TMRW [Ambitious Tapes] <br>\nGesang Der Jünglinge - Karlheinz Stockhausen [Deutsche Grammophon] <br>\nGloria II, Domine Deus - Ákos Rózmann [Unreleased] <br>\nUndular - Caterina Barbieri [Cassauna/Important Records] <br></p>\n<p><em>Special thanks to Mats Erlandsson for technical support.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&light=1&feed=%2Fstraylandings%2Fa-history-of-ems-maria-w-horn-and-mats-lindstr%C3%B6m-on-resonance-fm%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>When Anna Vtorova debuted as Machine Woman in 2014 with the abrasive 'Pink Silk' cassette, following up with releases on Peder Mannerfelt Produktion and Sacred Tapes, it looked like she'd set a clear path for herself. Her Sähkö-indebted experiments seemed best suited to rather sedate gigs in converted industrial spaces. The last two releases have seen Vtorova explore a new path however.</p>\n<p>2016's 'Genau House' EP on Where To Now? saw smoked-out waves of  reductionist house offset with Vtorova's home-recorded vocals, creating a sultry and expressive 12&quot; packed with character and unexpected twists. Her latest 12&quot;, 'When Lobster Comes Home', released on Ninja Tune subsidiary Technicolour Recordings follows a similar, yet more assertive blueprint; it's attuned to the dancefloor more than anything else.</p>\n<p>The release is an intriguing mix of infectious house grooves and glitched-out abstractions, pushed to their very limits. 'Camile From OHM Makes Me Feel Loved' places buoyant bass motifs against dusty, Workshop-style synth play and grainy house rhythms. Stuttered vocals roll out in languid chants, calling to mind the kind of protracted vocal experiments found in Madteo's 2012 LP, <em>Noi No</em>.</p>\n<p>'But It Was Like 30 Intros In A Row' takes proceedings into even wilder terrain; the track sounds like it has been put through an industrial shredder several times over before being stuck back together in haphazard fashion. It's funk-laced and rammed with energy, making a nice lead into the closer, 'I Want To Fuck Tech House', which sounds something like Actress writing the loading music for a mid-90s arcade game. High-sheen arpeggios and guttural vocal manipulations reach dizzying heights atop buzzing, malfunctioned grooves.</p>\n<p>Vtorova has always approached this stuff with a sense of fun, and the track titles for this latest release suggest nothing's changed. It's nice to see a relatively new artist experimenting with some quite radically different styles to her former pursuits, especially when she has already seen great success in those areas.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/335206387&color=d7d7d7&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Swedish imprint XKatedral have released a new trilogy of cassettes, featuring work from Dufwa, Golden Offence Orchestra and Isak Edberg. The first in the trilogy sees Maria W Horn and Mats Erlandsson together under a new project, entitled 'Dufwa'. For their debut release under this name, Horn and Erlandsson take microscopic field-recordings from the Spanish countryside, and project them onto a rich terrain of subs, drones and digital processing. The effect is like crawling through mud amid fetid vegetation and creepy crawlies.</p>\n<p>Next, a live recording from Golden Offence Orchestra of Pauline Oliveros' legendary piece, “To Valerie Solanas and Marilyn Monroe In Recognition of Their Desperation&quot;. The original piece from 1970 has been performed by many configurations, from a 14-piece ensemble at its 1970 premier at Hope College, to the 1977 Wesleyan University recording by a 43-piece orchestra. This performance sees Ellen Arkbro, Isak Edberg, Mats Erlandsson and Kali Malone among others in their own chilling rendition. In light of Oliveros' sad passing late last year, this is an important piece to return to.</p>\n<p>Finally, <em>Ondulations</em>: a celestial chord-cycle of organ tones from Isak Edberg. Although contained to sixty minutes, the piece reaches for the cosmic infinite. Bringing to mind La Monte Young's ambitious aim: &quot;If listeners ain't carried away to heaven, I'm failing...&quot;. You can all stream all three cassettes over at the <a href=\"https://xkatedral.bandcamp.com/\">XKatedral Bandcamp</a>.

    "content": "<p>The latest in our mix series comes Wolfgang Röttger, perhaps better known as Morgen Wurde. Röttger has had a prolific career over the last few years, releasing three records of intense dark-ambient jazz experiments. The term 'ambient-jazz' is maybe the sort of thing to turn many stomachs. Bringing to mind pot-smoking, ponytails and polo necks. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jHzdMo-YCc\">Niiiice</a>.</p>\n<p>But there has been some major contributions from the genre. Miles Davis' <em>Bitches Brew</em> arguably started it all, and remember the dark soundscapes of Bohren &amp; Der Club of Gore and Angelo Badalamenti's decade-defining soundtrack to <em>Twin Peaks</em>. Moreover, not all of it is sappy or sentimental. Wolf Eyes and Okkyung Lee have been fusing noise and improv to make jazz transgressive again.</p>\n<p>With much of this stuff, a real or imaged visual element is often suggested. Listeners frequently cite Italian cinema, barren landscapes and dimly lit streets. Indeed, Röttger's latest record, <em>Assassinous Act</em>, soundtracks a fictional film noir. The package for <a href=\"https://timereleasedsound.bandcamp.com/album/assassinous-act\"><em>Assassinous Act</em></a> comes complete with a fake &quot;crime kit&quot;: fingerprint cards, numbered toe tags and mugshots. All presented in a sepia-toned wartime aesthetic. The idea is to listen through the album whilst solving this contrived whodunnit. But what's wrong with a little bit of youthful novelty anyway?</p>\n<p>The mix that Röttger recorded for us is no less conceptual, featuring a selection of his favourite 'wind' music. Trumpets and sax feature heavily, often somber and alone against an unsettling backdrop of noise and atmospherics. If, like me, your knowledge of jazz has something to be desired, then much (all) of this tracklisting will look unfamiliar. Just try to push those ponytails to the back of your mind and get stuck in.</p>\n<p><strong>Tracklist:</strong></p>\n<p>Foltz, Turner, Carrothers - Crosses <br>\nSonik Teatar (Damir Bacikin &amp; Nikola Jeremic) - Noise 2 <br>\nSatoko Fujii &amp; Natsuki Tamura - Dune and Star <br>\nHeinz Sauer &amp; Michael Wollny - Seven Sharp <br>\nDi Domenico, Henriksen, Yamamoto - Mlouk <br>\nPer Jørgensen, Jon Balke, Audun Kleive - Blind Owl <br>\nNils Petter Molvaer - Perimeters <br>\nColorlist - Montreal <br>\nArve Henriksen - Saraswati <br>\nRone feat.

    "content": "<p>A new compilation in aid of Hurricane Harvey has been launched by DJ-producers Malcriado and Englesia. The name 'Malcriado' comes from the Spanish word for 'spoiled', but here it is us being spoiled with a litany of musical curiosities. Among them, new material from Laurel Halo, a Chino Amobi sound collage and an abstract rework of Nine Inch Nails' 'Closer' (<em>I wanna fuck you like an animal...</em>). Kareem Lofty's mournful 'Swamp' is particularly special. Some may know Englesia from the nascent UNITI event series: a night championing women, non-binary and LGBTQ+ musicians. You can get a taste of the UNITI nights on Englesia's own contribution to the compilation, 'Don't FW Me'.</p>\n<p>All proceeds from PRAXIS HOUSTON go towards Greater Houston Autonomous Relief (GHAR), a grassroots coalition of groups from the Greater Houston community, offering direct support to those most impacted by Hurricane Harvey. GHAR are unique in that they work without the aid of the state or from private corporations, instead working horizontally in solidarity.

    "content": "<p>I first came across Hypermedium at this year's FASMA Festival. Occupying a basement venue under the notorious s.i.x dogs, I wasn't quite sure of what to expect as the label were only a couple of releases deep at the time. I'm not sure I left any better informed about the imprint's focus however, as they hosted everything from the ragged half-step of Xyn Cabal to EVOL's untameable square-wave symphonies.</p>\n<p>Their latest release defies expectations in equal measure, written by South African gqom outfit Audioboyz. The group is comprised of DJ Motion, DJ Fatonic, Percy and Njeh, who have been pushing the burgeoning South African house genre since around 2012. Entitled 'The Rise Of Gqom', their record for Hypermedium is a stunning example of gqom's ability to captivate dancefloors; tripped-out kicks, toms and beaters building to insurmountable pressure across four languid percussive jams.</p>\n<p>With the release out on September 8, we invited the outfit to contribute to our 'That Time When' series, discussing five of their most memorable gqom parties.</p>\n<p>###1 Leons Marikana Lounge in Inanda, Newtown A _ 2014</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4379/37037895586_c249ef2ea7_b.jpg\" alt=\"a\"></p>\n<p>Leons Marikana Lounge is a place located in a township called Inanda, Newtown A. This place has a tremendous vibe and the people are full of energy and warmth. The first time we went there was in 2014. At that time gqom wasn’t as huge as it is now but people in Durban and the surrounding areas really loved it. We came up with a different kind of gqom and people took no time to accept us and our unique style. On the day of the event it was so full that they had to close the gates!</p>\n<p>Our set was at 1.00am and waiting at the VIP we couldn’t wait for our set to come and make all those people dance. When we got on the decks, the dance floor was on fire and every single person at the venue was dancing. Thirty minutes into the set people were shouting our name “AudioBoyz” with a certain groovy style. We were supposed to play for an hour but we ended up playing for two because people wouldn’t let us end. It was a great township experience and we wouldn’t trade it for anything.</p>\n<p>###2 The Biggest House Party (TBHP) in Durban _ 2015</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4428/36830762890_ccb5754702_b.jpg\" alt=\"tbhp\"></p>\n<p>The Biggest House Party was organised by a friend of ours who wanted to host one of the biggest house parties in Durban as the name states. Durban was buzzing with regards to this event because it had a mix of different artists, DJs and genres. It attracted a lot of people and tickets were sold out in two weeks. The venue had to be changed to a bigger space and more tickets were made available. We knew the party was going to be a blast because of the amount of people who bought tickets.</p>\n<p>Our set was at midnight and we were playing after a well known hip-hop artist. We were happy about that because we knew that we were going to get a great response from the crowd since they would have been jamming to hip-hop for hours and would be longing for something different. The sound quality was great and we set the dance floor on fire with our gqom sounds; people really enjoyed our set and as a result we got two more gigs on the day.</p>\n<p>###3 Vacca Matta in Durban _ 2015</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4427/37228828075_da034aed6c.jpg\" alt=\"qw\"></p>\n<p>Vacca Matta is a club/lounge located in Morningside, Durban on the famous Florida Road, where you find only the best clubs in town. Vacca Mata is in a perfect location that brings new experience to music lovers from all walks of life. Playing there made us realise that all people enjoy gqom music, from Indians to whites and Africans.</p>\n<p>This place showed us that through music we can get together and have a good time. We played our gqom songs and the club 'got lit'; the noises of excitement and happiness were alive. The people shouting “iAudio Leli” which basically means 'this is Audioboyz'. We were supposed to play for an hour but ended up playing for an hour and a half. It was one of the most memorable and unforgettable nights and we will hold that in our hearts forever.</p>\n<p>###4 Spank Music Lounge in Durban _ 2013</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4384/36830762830_6712d91dcb_b.jpg\" alt=\"op\"></p>\n<p>Spank Music Lounge was a club that was located in the CBD in Durban and it was known as the only big club in Durban that would exclusively play gqom. The club would illegally let underage kids into the club and would get so full on Saturdays that it could take you ages just to get to the toilet or the door. It would be full from 3pm until 4am of the following day. We played there several times alongside other gqom artists from Durban. We knew that every Saturday we were going to be there. We made new songs every week just so we could play them at Spank for the masses.</p>\n<p>At that time gqom was not even recognised as a genre. People outside of Durban complained about it being to loud but they danced to it when they were in clubs. It was so confusing because on social networks gqom was criticised but everyone danced to it at Spank and in other clubs. This club gave us the most memories as emerging gqom artists, as it was the only club where the genre was fully accepted. We had the greatest fun there; the music was great, the energy was unbelievable and the food was something to die for. The owner of the club made sure you had the best of everything when you were there and that’s how he kept people coming back for more.</p>\n<p>###5 The Waiting Room in Cape Town _ 2017</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4357/37228827985_f14754fc26_z.jpg\" alt=\"qw\"></p>\n<p>The Waiting Room is a club located in Cape Town’s Long Street and everyone in South Africa knows that Long Street is always a blast. We had meetings with Red Bull and the guy who was hosting the event at The Waiting Room called us two weeks before the event. He told us that he heard that we were coming to Cape Town and asked us if we could play at his event, so we told him we would really like to play there. He came to our meetings and interviews at Red Bull studios before the event; we had long chats regarding music and what to expect at The Waiting Room.</p>\n<p>On the day of the event we were excited to play, but when we got there we were worried because 90% of the people were white and we thought that they might not enjoy gqom. They made noises of appreciation before we even started playing and that boosted our confidence. We played the closing set and the dance floor was on fire, we couldn’t believe it! That’s when we realised that music is a universal language that everyone can understand and relate to. They were dancing to every single song shouting “woh woh woh wozzzzzzaaa!!!”, which basically means 'we want more'. This was by far the most unforgettable night and we can’t wait to go play there again.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/347087014&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>I first came across the work of Chlo Edwards, aka CXLO watching her perform at a Conditional night in Manor House's New River Studios. Her sound is intriguing; in many ways dense and chaotic, yet in other ways incredibly high-sheen and polished.</p>\n<p>Another intriguing thing about CXLO is that it has remained an entirely live project so far - she has performed in venues around the UK but is yet to see a release. Recently, she played at the ICA in London, for an EAVI gig. &quot;Adam Parkinson [Dane Law] asked me to DJ and said I could get weird&quot; she begins when asked about the show. &quot;As it was in a gallery I felt it was a good space to experiment using other peoples songs. At some points I had four songs playing, stretched to their extremes. I was just processing the textures and blending them together. I was also controlling all the panning as I wanted it to feel like the audience were inside it.&quot;</p>\n<p>Pressed on why she has immersed herself in the live aspect of electronic music so far rather than releasing, she reveals its a way to experiment as much as anything else. &quot;I wanted to get in a live space as much as possible&quot; she starts. &quot;I think it's because I'm used to being in a band so being in a loud space with other people was part of the writing process. I've been using live shows as a way to learn and experiment.&quot;</p>\n<p>Edwards began her forays into electronic music as a teenager, writing abstract breakcore before being sucked into the band circuit for a while. &quot;My laptop got smashed and the band started to get really active&quot; she says of her hiatus from production. &quot;I poured myself into bands for about ten years. My most recent band broke up just over a year ago and that's when I decided to start producing again. I downloaded Ableton last September and have basically spent the last year doing it full time just learning and writing.&quot;</p>\n<p>Growing up in Cornwall, there was an obvious draw to labels like Warp and Planet Mu for Edwards. &quot;In those days it was like Hellfish &amp; Producer, Venetian Snares, Doormouse and so on&quot; she says of her early influences. &quot;I used to come up to London to go to Bangface when I was like 17 (laughs). I'd tell my mum I was staying at a mates and just get on a train to London. I loved the chaotic rhythms and energy.&quot;</p>\n<p>Later this year, there are plans for a CXLO EP, although it's yet to be seen quite when it will see its release.  While we wait though, Edwards has been kind enough to contribute to our mix series, providing half an hour of butchered contemporary electronics.</p>\n<h3>Tracklist</h3>\n<p>Loto Retina - Forme 2 <br>\nRoel Funken - Malvo Sims <br>\nSuda - Inter <br>\nM.E.S.H. - Thorium <br>\nN1L - Hazy One <br>\nRoel Funken - Snapp Zoid <br>\nTeengirl Fantasy - Star Rise <br>\nQoso-  Peaches 'N Cream <br>\nRoel Funken - Greytone Baxter <br>\nLow Jack - Coquelin Cloarec (Emotions) <br>\nSlavish Armani - The Water Awaits You <br>\nLoto Retina - Forme 3 <br></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?light=1&feed=%2Fstraylandings%2F0080-cxlo%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>It's hard not to be impressed by the musical background of composer Yair Elazar Glotman. With education in jazz, classical, then electronic music, his influences are vast and varied. Anyone who has listened to his music can hear this. There is of course the technical proficiency of the playing — the contrabass in particular. Each record also sounds live in the ‘here-and-now’; as if played before your very eyes at a jazz club. But he also brings a modern sheen along with electronic processing to elevate the pieces into the avant-garde; not as a cheesy add-on or afterthought, but through subtle layering and reduction.</p>\n<p>On his latest record, <em>Compound</em>, Glotman brings all three of these features together. A trio of jazz musicians improvise motifs, loops and tonal ideas around Glotman’s instructions, later manipulated and contorted in the studio. The album has a creaking and uneasy sound to it, with a perpetual sense of incoming danger. This marks the second Subtext release for Glotman, and adds yet another to the label's impressive flurry of albums this year. In anticipation of this release, we caught up with Glotman to talk about the making of the record, the philosophy of improvisation, and regaining trust in other people.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/340130881&color=%230b0b0a&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I've just finished watching the new series of Twin Peaks, and it got me thinking about the the types of abstraction you can achieve with TV versus, say, music. People often say music is the most abstract art form. Do you agree?</strong></p>\n<p>Somehow David Lynch managed to create abstraction in visual language. TV and film almost always has some kind of reference to something, but Lynch managed to make something more atmospheric and 'free-form' with his work to tell his stories. For me, listening to music (say on headphones) is very different from seeing live music. I guess live music is the original form of music: the very earliest music was probably just people banging on stuff, and then music as an abstract idea came around the end of the 19th century with the development of recorded sound medium. Hearing a note on headphones is so abstracted away from the original instance of the note being played. When you watch someone play violin, you have this very clear sense of the cause and effect between the player and the sensation of the sound. But when you listen on headphones, you could very easily forget that this is art generated by human beings. It's almost like the music is being produced by your own head.</p>\n<p><strong>You've done a lot of work with film, how did you get into that?</strong></p>\n<p>I've always been making music for short films and video-art. I studied media-art so I was always studying generative art and sound-art. But I had a lot friends making experimental films so I was always collaborating with them. In general, I am Interested in the use of music and sound various mediums where its role changes.</p>\n<p><strong>I think your music lends itself very well to cinema. Especially with <em>Compound</em>, I have this ongoing film running through my head when I listen to it.</strong></p>\n<p>Right. When I write for other mediums — for example in my practice of sound installations — it's more about creating a kind of environment, rather than a strictly visual idea. That could be just an emotional environment, or atmospheric tension. So when I write for films, it’s just taking that environment and making it more precise; more visceral: you're hearing and seeing the environment at the same time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4335/36499250713_f5cdb8f655_h.jpg\" alt=\"yair\">\n<em>Photo by Camille Blake</em></p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about your history with the contrabass?</strong></p>\n<p>I studied jazz before shifting to classical, when I was about 14 years old. Around 5 years ago, I left the contrabass for a while but I started to feel the big sensation of guilt for not playing it. It’s such a big piece of furniture, it’s hard to ignore. I began to feel haunted by it, so I had to return. But I also wanted to free myself from the instrument (its traditional playing style, typical sounds) and find a way for the instrument to play itself. I’m interested in trying to deliberately lose control of the instrument. So I started using feedback chaining within the contrabass. And that got me back into using the instrument.</p>\n<p><strong>I think it’s important to free oneself from an instruments traditional usage. One issue I have with singular instruments is that you usually have to be part of some group to create music. Laptops don’t have this problem — you can be everything at once.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah but I haven’t forgotten the importance of collaboration. I used to be frustrated by being a bass player, and relying on other musicians to express myself. Like you say, electronic music is very freeing in that sense. But you can get completely lost in the do-it-yourself mentality. You start to get lost in your own ideas. So I’m starting to gain trust again in other people (laughs).</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/323890947&color=0b0b0a&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>You had that release with Mats Erlandsson earlier this year, for example.</strong></p>\n<p>This is maybe the first example of a successful collaboration for me. That album was very inspiring; to find someone you share trust and sensibilities with. Not a lot of people know this but Mats is also an amazing guitar player. We were playing around and decided that we wanted to create fake medieval music. That was the starting point.</p>\n<p><strong>I was surprised to hear that there was a lot of post-processing on this record. It's sounds completely live to me.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah there are many many layers of improvisation on this record. On a technical level it was like developing a system or language of improvisation. I would instruct these techniques and they would change and evolve depending on the improvisors’ comfort with a particular motif or their mood at that time. <em>Compound</em> is like reverse-engineered live music. I also had to think a lot about how to record and how to play to create these layers. Wanting it sound live and unlayered was totally the goal I was aiming for. There are times when there are six different takes on top of each other but they are completely hidden. You kind of deconstruct and rebuilt the whole thing.</p>\n<p>It’s also a very spectral focused piece of music. Sometimes there would be 16 different microphones for one take, and after layering few takes I would end up with about 200 channels which turned my mixing process into a Sisyphean climb. My aim was to sounds like a trio with 12 pairs of hands (laughs).</p>\n<p><strong>I often see that as the kind of goal of a lot of electronic music — to reintroduce this ‘live’ or ‘physical’ feel, which is often lost with laptop performances.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah that’s why I’m interested in this dissonance between improvisation (like capturing a certain moment) and post-production (where you closely analyse the materials and sounds). But you always have this backbone of energy from the original performance.</p>\n<p><strong>What have you got planned for the rest of the year?</strong></p>\n<p>I am brewing some ideas at the moment but nothing concrete. I need more time to develop something meaningful to me at this moment. At the moment, I feel as if I have reached a limit of what I feel I can do, what I feel inspired by in myself. I am looking for others to work with for inspiration right now: musicians, teachers, composers… I need a reset.</p>\n<p><em>Compound is out on Subtext on 6th October.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/215153804&color=%230b0b0a&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Tobias Pedersen aka Beastie Respond is an artist who has undergone plenty of change over the years. His early releases followed a relatively straightforward dancefloor trajectory; albeit always with a heavy focus on melody and instrumentation. Stylistically they often centered around UK dance genres, taking heavy influence from D&amp;B, dubstep and jungle.</p>\n<p>In the last few years however, the Danish artist's palette has grown to include a much wider range of references. September's Foul-Up released <em>Information City</em> took on the problems of the information age, seeking to fragment and reassemble sample material from Pedersen's day-to-day online consumption. Snapchat videos, YouTube clips and newsreel segments all made it on to the album in a visceral, full-throttle explosion of ideas and textures.</p>\n<p>With the album out for a number of months, we invited Pedersen to contribute to our 'That Time When' series, discussing five of his most memorable gigging experiences.</p>\n<p>###1 Dunkel Bar in Copenhagen _ 2010</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4510/37660147931_9dbba413af_b.jpg\" alt=\"a\"></p>\n<p>I had booked dBridge to play at my club night at the legendary Dunkel Bar in Copenhagen. I was 21 years old and this was the second night I ever hosted, so I was completely green to doing promotion. At that time the Autonomic sound was peaking and I was into it heavily. For me it was very special to get a guy like dBridge over to Copenhagen. I had been touring with my band the three previous days and also had a concert the night of the show, so it was a tight schedule for me. I picked him up at the airport and we went to grab some food. I left for the concert came back when the club opened. A <em>long</em> time passed before people started to arrive so I was really worried. Anyway it ended up being packed - dBridge smashed it, laughs were had, the mood was high and he wheeled 'Syncopy' three times I think when I played my set after him. An amazing memory.</p>\n<p>###2 Roskilde Festival in Roskilde, Denmark _ 2012</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4485/23806838058_5299d44425_b.jpg\" alt=\"qw\"></p>\n<p>Playing at Roskilde Festival, the biggest festival in Denmark when I was 23 was quite an experience. I grew up in Roskilde and I had attended the festival for quite some time so it was really special to actually go there and play. Back then I used to do the full week. Camping for three or four days before the actual festival began; pissed most of the time. I can’t do that anymore. Last time I went was in 2016. I went two days and that was more than enough for me.</p>\n<p>###3 Image Movement in Berlin _ 2017</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4462/37401879090_4463a665a0_b.jpg\" alt=\"e\"></p>\n<p>At Image Movement I tried to do the musical accompaniment for Eva Papamargaritis animated works, which was shown in the shop. I played with Traktor and a decade old midi-controller. Not my favourite way of DJing at all. I thought it would be like a little reception where people would have a beer and a chat and then the music and the art was in the background like it mostly is back in Copenhagen. It turned out to be quite the opposite. There was a bit of talking to begin with but as I started accompanying the animations people turned completely silent. They were watching and listening for one hour and not a single word was uttered. I was both impressed and humbled.</p>\n<p>###4 Decession at Volksbühne, Berlin _ 2016</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4452/37401879030_5b10c1a044_b.jpg\" alt=\"o\"></p>\n<p>Decession at Volksbühne in Berlin. I was feeling a bit ill from the escapades the night before and I didn’t know much about what was going to happen. I went with my good friend Nicolai who I bought the tickets for, as a birthday present. Despite my aching body and disbelief in leaving the bed that day the night turned out to be a complete game changer for me. Drinking nothing but Apfelschorle and refreshing myself with Physical Therapy’s funny smelling Eau De Dance cologne. M.E.S.H and Amnesia Scanner blew me completely away musically, visually… in all senses really. The reverent attitude from the audience, the setting and the music all together made this a very special night for me.</p>\n<p>###5 Code Orange in Denmark _ 2017</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4491/37401879070_a652154b63_b.jpg\" alt=\"er\"></p>\n<p>My friend, and roommate, is heavily into Hardcore. Not hardcore as in warehouse rave hardcore, but hardcore as Terror, Expire and Code Orange. The latter has turned into a huge influence for me. I’m not sure you can hear it in my music though. But it’s music full of passion and energy. I saw Code Orange when they were warming up for the French metal band Gojira. It was a funny experience because the metal audience in Denmark is very grown up and mature, kind and sweet middle aged men, but a little bit boring. The energy coming from the stage when Code Orange went on exceeded the energy the audience gave back tenfold. The band didn’t seem to care and continued tirelessly for a good 45 minutes. It was one of the best shows I had seen for a while but I’d really like to see them with a more engaged audience sometime.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/339834126&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>“My sole ambition as a composer is to hurl my javelin into the infinite space of the future.”</em> – Franz Liszt</p>\n<p>The term 'Futurism' has a curious history through the arts. Its earliest incarnations can be found in Marinetti's description of Italian society during the early 1900s. Here, art had become transfixed by the innovations of the modern age: the racing car, the aeroplane, the industrial city. Where the Romantics held a nostalgic longing for a pre-industrial age, the Futurists embraced modernity, in all its brutal reality. Music soon followed. Luigi Russolo in particular became one of the first ‘noise musicians’ in history, designing and performing with his own homemade mechanical instruments. It's rumoured that Russolo’s first performance of futurist music – entitled ‘Awakening of a City’ – caused riots amongst the audience. Such was the shock of this movement. The Futurists worshiped technology above all and encouraged its enforcement through order, violence and industry. Little surprise that fascism also became central to their cause.</p>\n<p>Fast forward 50 years, and futurism re-emerges in the clubs and factories of industrial America. As companies like Ford began automating the labour market in Detroit factories, the city responded with post-industrial afro-futurism. The Detroit techno DJs, influenced by Kraftwerk, soundtracked the widespread mechanisation of labour. The Futurist fixation on technology found a new God: the drum machine. “We want to make music of the future” they said. And for many, this future looked bleak. Club music began to lose the soulful vocals of house and the tempos accelerated to dizzy new heights. Nick Land, the 'Neo-Reactionary' father of accelerationism dubbed this sound as ‘Manically Dehumanised Machine Music’. But the body of work produced during this period is often heralded as the benchmark of a successful club music culture, perhaps the most compelling artistic example of futurism to date.</p>\n<p>Today, futurism in electronic music has many different guises. The Sci-Fi ambient soundscapes of Oneohtrix Point Never and Vapourwave hold a strange nostalgia for the futurist visions of the late 20th century. Forged from the ashes of cyberpunk, they take their source material from TV advertisements, VHS cassettes and Windows 95. The attitude is far removed from the dynamism of 20s Italy and 80s Detroit; instead lending itself to pot-smoking, basement-dwelling and introspection.</p>\n<p>Now there is the ‘accelerationist’ side of modern electronic music. Pan, Janus, NON and PC Music have pushed for an increased ‘need for speed’ in music to match our accelerating society. The music <em>feels</em> like how using the Internet <em>feels</em>: fragmented, frenzied and fleeting. Its subjects are corporatism, consumerism and capitalism. But it’s often hard to discern parody from sincerity.</p>\n<p>Understanding contemporary projections of the future gives us an understanding of our present moment. Future-oriented music is crucial in this regard. If, as Marx says, revolution is the locomotive of world history, we ought to be listening out for its arrival. After all, as David Bowie put it, “the future belongs to those who can hear it coming”.</p>\n<p>On this month’s Resonance FM show, we spoke to Rena Minegishi (aka Object Blue) and Emile Frankel about acclerationist music: its historical connection to futurism, its aesthetics and its politics.

    "content": "<p>Its been interesting to watch the journey Hyperdub have been on since its founding. The project began as a webzine in 2000, before graduating to label status in 2004, largely releasing dubstep and other hybrid UK dance experimentations.</p>\n<p>Later, founder Steve Goodman aka Kode 9 began to showcase an array of footwork, hip-hop and R&amp;B, releasing works from the likes of DJ Rashad, Jesse Lanza and Babyfather. One of the biggest signifiers of this changing interest for me was seeing Okzharp’s collaboration with Manthe Ribane, 'Dear Ribane' played during the opening of Beyoncé’s world tour.</p>\n<p>Klein, their latest signing, is another artist who defies categorisation to a large extent. I first heard of her after reading about her receipt of an Oram Award, an scheme managed by the PRS Foundation and The New BBC Radiophonic Workshop. Yet despite gaining recognition from this more academic side to electronic music, Klein's work is packed with originality and depth.</p>\n<p><em>Tommy</em> melts influences from gospel, R&amp;B and pop music into a bugged-out and disorienting haze. There’s plenty to be challenged by here, tangled webs of syrupy vocals and cloying, detuned organs work together to create a sound which feels both rich in emotion, yet also strangely synthetic. The sullen piano motifs and longing vocals of 'Cry Theme' make a good example, gradually building to a stuttered climax, droning glitch-tones buzzing relentlessly.</p>\n<p>The whole album is soaked in cloudy reverbs, soothing the transitions between Klein's mercilessly spliced sample material. 'Everlong' and 'B2k' are two of my favourites on the EP, and a good example of this. Cranky, data-moshed percussion and pitch-tweaked vocals are processed to oblivion, leaving your head spinning.</p>\n<p>The release as a whole is a challenging listen, and one which takes time to adjust to. What's certain is that Klein has created a space for herself which feels completely new and uncharted - an impressive feat in a time where fresh concepts are few and far between. I look forward to seeing where this approach takes her in the future.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/339126431&color=%23cfcdcb&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>You could probably write a multi-volume book just on Iannis Xenakis' wartime experience, so I'll try to keep this as concise as possible. Born in Romania in 1922 to Greek parents, Xenakis was an architect, engineer and composer. He was also among the 20th Century's most forward-thinking.</p>\n<p>His disciplines were often interlinked. Xenakis created compositions for different spaces and designed spaces for specific compositions. In 1977 he also created the UPIC, a programme which could, &quot;translate graphic images into musical results&quot;. With this tool, Xenakis would use his architectural drawings as the basis of some of his compositions.</p>\n<p>His architectural studies began in Greece, where he also studied the laws of harmony and counterpoint. Despite finishing his exams, Xenakis' education was interrupted by the onset of WWII and the preceding Greco-Italian War. WWII left Xenakis with a scar across the side of his face and blind in his left eye. After Greece was liberated from Axis forces in 1944, Churchill ordered allied troops to fight dissidents to reinstate the Greek monarchy. As a communist resistance member, Xenakis engaged in fighting British tanks, whereupon he was hit with a blast of shrapnel. The fact he survived has been described as a miracle by some.</p>\n<p>In 1947 the Greek government began arresting former left-wing resistance members, prompting Xenakis to flee to Paris. While there, he was sentenced to death in Greece, a charge which was later commuted to ten years in prison and only dropped in 1974 after a regime change. Leaving Greece was a painful experience for Xenakis, and he expressed his discomfort at leaving the country he had fought for, and the comrades he had fought with behind.</p>\n<p><em>&quot;I felt I was in debt to them and that I had to repay that debt. And I felt I had a mission. I had to do something important to regain the right to live. It wasn't just a question of music—it was something much more significant.&quot;</em></p>\n<p>Xenakis died in 2001 at his home in Paris aged 78, after lapsing into a coma. 16 years on from his death, his music is still considered some of the most visceral and exciting ever created. His compositions tower above the listener; building colossal, abstract structures right before your eyes, then letting them collapse with drama and intensity, so the process can begin anew.</p>\n<p>To commemorate his influence, we wrote about three of our favourite works from his discography.</p>\n<p>###1 Electro-Acoustic Music (1970) <br/></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q-cWg3a1b1I\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>Given it's conceptual breadth and contemporary sound, it's impressive to read that a piece of music like Xenakis’ <em>Electro-Acoustic Music</em> was released in 1970. But it's frankly ridiculous to read that these pieces were actually composed between 1957 and 1962. Across 45 minutes, Xenakis conjures Lovecraftian drones, tumbling, broken crockery sound-design and thunderous, concorde jet-engine assaults. The result is wildly adventurous and meticulous in its execution; a truly future-gazing vision of what music could look like, even by today’s standards.</p>\n<p>###2 Persepolis (1970) <br/></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/S-GEbbgT5Io\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>One of Xenakis' key concepts throughout his career was the 'Polytope'. In Geometry, a polytope is any shape with flat sides. But in Xenakis' musical universe, this word was used almost literally: poly- meaning &quot;many&quot; and -tope meaning &quot;sites&quot;. Xenakis' polytopes were multimedia explorations of sound, space and science. They were essentially installations on a mass-scale, with everything from lasers to mirrors, flaunting his knowledge of architecture. In 1971, Xenakis was commissioned to write a piece commemorating the 2500th anniversary of Iran's founding. Like all of the polytopes, they centre on a particular geography, this time on the great ancient capital of Persepolis.</p>\n<p>###3 Pléiades (1979) <br/></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dqtFGaHcWRk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><em>Pléiades</em> stands out among Xenakis’ discography for me. Written entirely for percussive instruments, Xenakis began to experiment with spatialisation - even positioning performers amongst the audience. He also had a special instrument commissioned for the piece, Sixxen, which is made up of 19 aluminium or steel and bronze bars and played with hammers. Sonically, <em>Pléiades</em> is a teeming forest of dense polyrhythms and booming subatomic hits. At times Xenakis’ drums trickle like light rainfall, at others barraging the listener with ferocity, like being caught in the eye of the storm.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Wolfgang Voigt's GAS project rests on a simple premise - taking LSD in a forest. In that sense it's perhaps not as grandiose as some might like to make it out to be, but he certainly does the job well. Across five full length LPs he has distilled the warmth and wonder of the experience perfectly. It should be mentioned there can be other, less immediately gratifying effects of LSD such as incapacitating confusion and trauma of having lost all perception of time, but for these purposes his approach is probably best.</p>\n<p>After a near 17 year hiatus, the project was revived this year with the release of <em>Narkopop</em>, an album which this performance in The Barbican centered around.</p>\n<p>Before Voigt took to the stage however, Opal Tapes' Huerco S provided the opening performance. Huerco S is an artist I like very much on the whole, and one who has released some impressively well thought-out music. Unfortunately, his set seemed too much like a GAS pastiche than a counterpoint to it. Woodland croaks, aqueous drones and teeming sound design are in theory all quite well suited to a GAS support slot, however the result felt comparatively hollow when succeeded by the real thing.</p>\n<p>The handout for the event quoted Brian Eno's definition of ambient music, which in his terms must be &quot;as ignorable as it is interesting.&quot; It's a definition I've never particularly liked, as it ignores the fact there's plenty of ambient music which can completely and utterly absorb you, and hold more lasting resonance than your typical track. Where these notes cited GAS as the exception to this rule, I'd argue he's a great example of its falsehood.</p>\n<p>This said, it is true that <em>Narkopop</em> feels like a more maximalist version of the GAS sound. Kicks churn and throb like an ever-present heartbeat, while a mesh of electronic ambience and string tones billow forth like thick fog. It's not necessarily anything new to the blueprint, it just feel like Voigt has created something richer and fuller sounding this time around.</p>\n<p>Sitting in The Barbican's concert hall, highlighted to me how far this project has come. Voigt is now sharing the same space I last saw the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, and with just as many faces in the crowd. This space is designed for its acoustics, and this combined with the rich, vaporous textures conjured by Voigt created an undeniably powerful presence. At the back of the stage a screen displayed footage a heavily wooded area; more than likely Königsforst in Cologne where Voigt took many of the trips which inspired GAS. The visuals drift between lucidity and an inebriated haze, twigs and branches meshing over one another, flowering into psychedelic hues.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned at the start, in many ways it's a very simple formula, yet to my mind this is its greatest feature. Voigt hasn't ended up drunk on success, trying to encorporate symphony orchestras or attach overblown narratives to the project. What we are presented with is much the same as it was in 1996 when the project began; it still has that same meditative, medicinal quality, it just communicates it that little bit more strongly.</p>\n<div style=\"position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/emUETcnDxnY?rel=0&controls=0&showinfo=0?ecver=2\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>",

The piece reels around like an LED advertising billboard, with a dazzling display of special effects and studio trickery. Over the top, an instructional voice repeats a cryptic mantra. The voice, like some kind of benevolent self-service machine who has become a bit too friendly, talks to me of pursed lips, moist tongues and bubbles of saliva.

    "content": "<p>Tobias Pedersen aka Beastie Respond is an artist who has undergone plenty of change over the years. His early releases followed a relatively straightforward dancefloor trajectory; albeit always with a heavy focus on melody and instrumentation. Stylistically they often centered around UK dance genres, taking heavy influence from D&amp;B, dubstep and jungle.</p>\n<p>In the last few years however, the Danish artist's palette has grown to include a much wider range of references. September's Foul-Up released <em>Information City</em> took on the problems of the information age, seeking to fragment and reassemble sample material from Pedersen's day-to-day online consumption. Snapchat videos, YouTube clips and newsreel segments all made it on to the album in a visceral, full-throttle explosion of ideas and textures.</p>\n<p>With the album out for a number of months, we invited Pedersen to contribute to our 'That Time When' series, discussing five of his most memorable gigging experiences.</p>\n<p>###1 Dunkel Bar in Copenhagen _ 2010</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4510/37660147931_9dbba413af_b.jpg\" alt=\"a\"></p>\n<p>I had booked dBridge to play at my club night at the legendary Dunkel Bar in Copenhagen. I was 21 years old and this was the second night I ever hosted, so I was completely green to doing promotion. At that time the Autonomic sound was peaking and I was into it heavily. For me it was very special to get a guy like dBridge over to Copenhagen. I had been touring with my band the three previous days and also had a concert the night of the show, so it was a tight schedule for me. I picked him up at the airport and we went to grab some food. I left for the concert came back when the club opened. A <em>long</em> time passed before people started to arrive so I was really worried. Anyway it ended up being packed - dBridge smashed it, laughs were had, the mood was high and he wheeled 'Syncopy' three times I think when I played my set after him. An amazing memory.</p>\n<p>###2 Roskilde Festival in Roskilde, Denmark _ 2012</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4485/23806838058_5299d44425_b.jpg\" alt=\"qw\"></p>\n<p>Playing at Roskilde Festival, the biggest festival in Denmark when I was 23 was quite an experience. I grew up in Roskilde and I had attended the festival for quite some time so it was really special to actually go there and play. Back then I used to do the full week. Camping for three or four days before the actual festival began; pissed most of the time. I can’t do that anymore. Last time I went was in 2016. I went two days and that was more than enough for me.</p>\n<p>###3 Image Movement in Berlin _ 2017</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4462/37401879090_4463a665a0_b.jpg\" alt=\"e\"></p>\n<p>At Image Movement I tried to do the musical accompaniment for Eva Papamargaritis animated works, which was shown in the shop. I played with Traktor and a decade old midi-controller. Not my favourite way of DJing at all. I thought it would be like a little reception where people would have a beer and a chat and then the music and the art was in the background like it mostly is back in Copenhagen. It turned out to be quite the opposite. There was a bit of talking to begin with but as I started accompanying the animations people turned completely silent. They were watching and listening for one hour and not a single word was uttered. I was both impressed and humbled.</p>\n<p>###4 Decession at Volksbühne, Berlin _ 2016</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4452/37401879030_5b10c1a044_b.jpg\" alt=\"o\"></p>\n<p>Decession at Volksbühne in Berlin. I was feeling a bit ill from the escapades the night before and I didn’t know much about what was going to happen. I went with my good friend Nicolai who I bought the tickets for, as a birthday present. Despite my aching body and disbelief in leaving the bed that day the night turned out to be a complete game changer for me. Drinking nothing but Apfelschorle and refreshing myself with Physical Therapy’s funny smelling Eau De Dance cologne. M.E.S.H and Amnesia Scanner blew me completely away musically, visually… in all senses really. The reverent attitude from the audience, the setting and the music all together made this a very special night for me.</p>\n<p>###5 Code Orange in Denmark _ 2017</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4491/37401879070_a652154b63_b.jpg\" alt=\"er\"></p>\n<p>My friend, and roommate, is heavily into Hardcore. Not hardcore as in warehouse rave hardcore, but hardcore as Terror, Expire and Code Orange. The latter has turned into a huge influence for me. I’m not sure you can hear it in my music though. But it’s music full of passion and energy. I saw Code Orange when they were warming up for the French metal band Gojira. It was a funny experience because the metal audience in Denmark is very grown up and mature, kind and sweet middle aged men, but a little bit boring. The energy coming from the stage when Code Orange went on exceeded the energy the audience gave back tenfold. The band didn’t seem to care and continued tirelessly for a good 45 minutes. It was one of the best shows I had seen for a while but I’d really like to see them with a more engaged audience sometime.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/339834126&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\"></iframe>",

Find tickets and more details on the Raung Raya <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1971256646481784/\">event page</a>, or via <a href=\"https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1014119?p=Ticket-Global\">Resident Advisor</a>, where a ticket bundle for all five events can be purchased for €60.</p>\n<p>Find full event details below:</p>\n<p>###Moondog for Gamelan\n8.00pm on Thursday 19 October 2017</p>\n<p>Iwan Gunawan and his ensemble will join Stefan Lakatos, performing a selection of compositions from the seminal <em>The Viking Of Sixth Avenue</em>, on specially built well-tempered bamboo Gamelan.</p>\n<p>###The Magic of Sunda\nWednesday 15 November 2017</p>\n<p>If you trace back far enough, Sunda is actually the ancient name for the archipelago known today as Indonesia. This event promises to represent a less traditional facet of Indonesian music, hosting Karinding Attack, a group comprised of ex-metal band members who perform using bamboo instruments they've built themselves. They will be joined by recent Morphine signees, Tarawangsa, as well as Rabih Beaini, Otto Sidharta and Uwalmassa.</p>\n<p>###Ata Ratu\nTuesday 5 December 2017</p>\n<p>Ata Ratu's appearance at Europalia Festival and Raung Raya marks the first time she has ventured outside of Indonesia, and promises to be a very special performance. She will be showcasing her unique vocal techniques as well as playing a stringed instrument she crafted herself, known as Juke. Joining her will be Aural Archipelago, project of the American ethnomusicologist Palmer Keen, as well as the original band of Rully Shabara (who wrote the excellent Morphine released 'Huruf Hidup' 7&quot;), Zoo.</p>\n<p>###The Craft of Senyawa\nWednesday 10 January 2018</p>\n<p>For followers of Morphine Records, Senyawa will need little introduction. The Yogyakarta-based duo, consisting of Wukir Suryadi and vocalist Rully Shabara, will present a selection of their compositions using instruments brought over from Yogyakarta. Supporting the performance will be the Belgian womens choir, Patshika Cie.</p>\n<p>###Aloysius Suwardi's Planet Harmonik\nTuesday 16 January 2018</p>\n<p>The Planet Harmonik Ensemble is comprised of 22 musicians, playing traditional Gamelan instruments. They will close the Raung Raya series with a performance led by Al Suwardi, one of the most notable figures in contemporary Indonesian Gamelan.</p>\n<div style=\"position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yKTwrJNhZCk?rel=0&controls=0&showinfo=0?ecver=2\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>",

    "content": "<p>The 'Happened' event series began as an offshoot from neo-minimalist imprint, SM-LL. The label is perhaps best known for platforming the more esoteric side of minimalism, championing three key principals: repetition, reduction and reference. The idea of 'Happened' was to bring this music out of the headphones and into the real world. It was a brave move, not least because of the recondite nature of the music. Would anyone be willing to submit their evenings to a few hours of intense experimentalism? Yes, it turns out. And although there is of course a strong cross-over between SM-LL and Happened, the event series is upon to a much broader scope of electronic music, from jungle to gabba to ambient. Since their first event just over a year ago, they have hosted events with Yves de Mey, Shelley Parker, Ewa Justka and Graham Dunning.</p>\n<p>Their next event is billed as an ode to experimental music from Taiwan, including performances from Alois Yang, Yen-Tzu Chang, Chiyou Ding and Happened-head-honcho, Lucia H Chung. In preparation for this event, Chiyou Ding has supplied a mix of some of his highlights from the Taiwanese experimental scene. &quot;Throughout this mix, you can hear some field recordings, noise, avant-grade and electronica pieces from different generational artists,&quot; Ding explains. &quot;I hope this mix demonstrates that there are some people doing some weird sounds in this small, sweet potato-shaped island&quot;. It's also worth noting that the majority of these compositions come from Yao Dajuin’s 'Post Concrete' imprint, an important resource for anyone interested in Taiwanese sound art (read more <a href=\"http://www.digicult.it/digimag/issue-062/yao-dajuin-china-academy-of-art-la-scuola-di-intermedia-art-di-hangzhou/\">here</a>).

    "content": "<p>The human voice has had a curious history with electronic music. In many ways, electronic music has been one of the most popular musical movements <em>not</em> to have vocals at the foreground. Sure you have the fabled garage R&amp;B cut-ups and house tracks with voiceovers talking about ‘back in the day’ and ‘<em>real</em> Detroit techno’. But the voice was used more like a musical instrument: a texture or sound rather the carrier of meaning. This is partly down to the context in which electronic music arose. Many of the early electronic pioneers were fascinating with robotics, AI and 'the singularity'. Hence the voice, arguably the most human of sounds, became mechanised alongside the drum machines and Sci-Fi synthesisers. Music was the future, was instrumental.</p>\n<p>But the voice-as-instrument is nothing new. Scat works as with non-semantic vocals delivery. Think of the passion in an Ella Fitzgerald freestyle solo or Shooby Taylor's nonsensical ramblings. Here, it's almost like words never mattered. We can derive just as much pleasure in the plosives and fricatives of the human voice without semantic content. In David Byrne's book <em>How Music Works</em>, he describes a technique he uses known as 'Emergent Storytelling' in which he would sing emotive phonetics along to a backing-track, with the hope of capturing some instinctive vocal sounds or rhythms that he could later layer lyrics on top of. There are even (amusing) recordings of half-finished Talking Heads songs which never made it to the 'lyric edit', such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL-SDVrOFkk\">this</a>.</p>\n<p>But surely we must be careful not to overlook the importance of semantic content to singing. Protest music in particular almost necessities semantic content to carry its intended purpose (when was the last time you heard instrumental music at a protest?). Imagine a Björk record with no words. Surely lyrics enable that personal, warm, fuzzy feeling. The feeling so much electronic music is lacking. What are we left with if we are reduced to mere babbling, or the empty 'hey's and 'yeah's of chart pop? Can't we do better?</p>\n<p>In this episode of Stray Landings FM, we talk to Elsa Hewitt and Derek Piotr about the human voice and its relationship to music. Do words matter to music?

    "content": "<p>The Berlin &amp; Bristol-based label, Subtext, are due to showcase their roster at the new Säule room next month. Over the past 12 months, Subtext have presented an impressive flurry of full-length releases. We saw Ellen Arkbro's bold and courageous composition, <a href=\"http://www.straylandings.co.uk/reviews/for-organ-and-brass-ellen-arkbro\"><em>For Organ &amp; Brass</em></a>, which will no doubt be topping many of those end-of-year lists in December. We also had FIS &amp; Rob Thorne with <a href=\"http://www.straylandings.co.uk/reviews/clear-stones-fis-rob-thorne\"><em>Clear Stones</em></a>, a record that was criminally overlooked at the time of release, but to my mind remains FIS' most original work. Then, a new album from <a href=\"http://www.straylandings.co.uk/podcasts/0076-cevdet-erek\">Cevdet Erek</a>, which explored a novel technique to play and record a traditional Turkish drum. And this month we had <em>Compound</em>, the unsettling new LP from jazz-experimentalist, <a href=\"http://www.straylandings.co.uk/interviews/reverse-engineering-yair-elazar-glotman-interview\">Yair Elazar Glotman</a>. For me, these four records cement Subtext as one of, if not the most interesting record label of 2017 so far.</p>\n<p>Their showcase presents all the artists mentioned above, as well as sets from Roly Porter and Emptyset. This will be at Berghain's exciting new 'Säule' venue, a room dedicated to platforming the more esoteric side of electronic music. Expect noise, drone, glitch and more besides. The opening of this venue was a good move. Berghain was getting dangerously close to being historically pigeon-holed as a techno venue and nothing more. But at last, Berghain has decided to awaken from its dogmatic slumbers and catch up with the present.</p>\n<p>The Subtext showcase will be held on 9th November, 2017.

    "content": "<p>Having only began two years ago, Calum Gunn’s Conditional imprint has been releasing music with staggering frequency. With 12 releases to date and six more on the horizon, Conditional champion the glory of running an underground label: short runs, quick turnarounds, and most importantly, a free exploration of musical innovation. Find gabba, live-coding and stark minimalism from the likes of Ewa Justka, rkss, Daniel M Karlsson and more.</p>\n<p>In our ‘In Focus’ series, we aim to demystify the world of running a label. What ethics, aesthetics and politics are taken into account when running an imprint? At a time when Soundcloud, Bandcamp and other digital platforms can act as a kind of surrogate label for anyone to broadcast their music, what’s the point of a label these days anyway? In this edition, we spoke to Calum Gunn, the man behind <em>Conditional</em>.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2188488867/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=3365075971/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://shop.conditional.club/album/tan-object\">Tan Object by Sebastian Camens</a></iframe>\n<p>“For me it's a way to highlight other people's work,” Gunn begins. “The idea is to platform music that would maybe be otherwise looked over, if not for some flimsy relation to Conditional. I quite like the idea of there being a kind of Conditional gang [laughs]. We’re just a loosely defined crew of friends who make sympathetic music. That’s it. I see Conditional as a group of comrades rather than a record label, I guess.”</p>\n<p>There is certainly a shared camaraderie around Conditional that’s not common to all labels. They recently released a <a href=\"http://shop.conditional.club/album/misapplications\">compilation</a>, featuring every artist on the roster, described as a “group photo from the whole family, all sharing a disregard for genre and form”. But what is the uniting sound of Conditional? What is the blood that runs through their veins?</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to tell, it’s just stuff I like. It’s a very good sound, I think [laughs]. It’s hard to pinpoint what it is that runs through all of it other than my own taste.” In some sense, this is the essence of a good label. The most successful labels in recent memory have been able to collectivise an array of seemingly disparate musicians, and find one common element between them all. Think, for example, of Hyberdub or Hessle Audio. Or Raster-Noton and Warp. In these cases, the label <em>is</em> the sound. They become a constellation for all music produced after. You could hear new music and say: “that belongs on this label”.</p>\n<p>“Conditional is quite undefined”, Gunn explains. “It can feel like a lot of responsibility, I’m no arbiter of good taste or anything. Or in anyway entitled to an opinion on anything, to be honest… I guess I will always be attracted to extreme music: extreme weirdness, extreme bounciness… I always find myself assigning physical properties to music in my head.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4504/26295191989_5d9eab4f68_b.jpg\" alt=\"cas\"></p>\n<p>In my <a href=\"http://www.straylandings.co.uk/podcasts/0078\">review of Sebastian Camen</a>’s <em>Tan Object</em>, I (pretentiously?) described the Conditional sound as being ‘object-oriented’. The focus of this music is not so much the players or the playing, but the sound-waves themselves. Each new release feels like a guided tour through the architecture of sine-, square- and triangle-waves. Each release also seems to be a unit unto itself. There’s no real series or collector’s catalogue. One release can be a vinyl, the next can be lanyard, the one after that comes as a poster. Each is its own artefact waiting to be discovered. However, Gunn seems to have his heart set on one format in particular: cassettes.</p>\n<p>“I love cassettes; they're great objects. They're cheap. They’re not too big. I didn't actually have a tape player for like 6 months after I started the label so I would just go to other people's houses to check master tapes&quot; [laughs]. The focus on cassettes might explain the quick-fire release schedule that Conditional is famous for. Their latest release, a 20-run cassette entitled ‘Richard’ was written and released in just over two weeks.</p>\n<p>“Yeah it's not bad eh? People keep sending me stuff. And I keep getting drunk and asking people to send me more. And therefore there's no end to it. We have a live-coder from Newcastle called Sean Cotterill and something from <a href=\"http://www.straylandings.co.uk/reviews/aan-ient-77arw\">tuuun</a> coming up soon.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4508/38040606292_3c0612a90e_b.jpg\" alt=\"gun\"></p>\n<p>Gunn is also a producer in his own right, and contributed towards the very first Conditional release, a split with Sebastian Camens. “I figured the first should be a split. Check it out. See how this all works”, Gunn goes on. “Conditional was always more of a place to platform other artists than a vessel for my own stuff. I haven't done any personal releases since that first one (except on our latest all-label compilation). It feels super weird releasing my own music to be honest. It's a waste of money [laughs]. For myself and for the customers…”</p>\n<p>However, Gunn’s input is never too far from sight, as he also produces the majority of the artwork for the label. “It sounds a bit daft but I'm really getting into handling the art direction. I just love laying out all the images, photoshopping and so on. I'm venturing more into design too. I also love the other artwork that's been done for the label, like Broshuda's poster for the newest compilation.”</p>\n<p>One of the more striking pieces of artwork was Ewa Justka’s own design for <a href=\"http://shop.conditional.club/album/efhksjerfbeskj\">her cassette</a> last year. “That was all her, I had nothing to do with that [laughs]. It's just like Microsoft paint clash of unflattering photos. It's so good. She sent me that and I was so happy. In one of the pictures, she's wearing her Maplin uniform. I saw that I just went yesssss…”</p>\n<p>It has always struck me that one issue running a label can be the sheer volume of demos to digest. Often, the most fulfilling music is hated on first listen. Those slow burners require work from you as a listener, and in return you are rewarded with a lifetime of enjoyment. But since your first listen is often wrong, how do we catch those gems that only reveal themselves with repeated listens? It seems now that in electronic music, everyone is competing for this ‘memability’: the music needs to catch your attention within the first listen or it will be forgotten forever.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=391527707/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=3551124969/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://shop.conditional.club/album/efhksjerfbeskj\">Efhksjerfbeskj by Ewa Justka</a></iframe>\n<p>“Maybe that’s why I don’t release much deep music [laughs]. I’m quite impatient I guess. But music can really take you by surprise. I recently got into Meshuggah, for example. I had maybe tried to listen to them 9 or 10 times in my life. Then I randomly came across them again the other week and was just like HOLY SHIT THIS IS THE BEST!” Gunn’s interest in metal can also be seen with their merchandise: a t-shirt that reads ‘COMPUTER MUSIC’ in classic (ironic) gothic typography.</p>\n<p>This is to be expected, since Gunn has reached the world of electronic music through a somewhat unconventional route. “I got into Happy Hardcore growing up in Scotland. Livingston, where I grew up, is a weird hotbed of happy hardcore, although I was bit too young for proper raves. From there I found jungle and breakcore and so on. My experience of experimental electronic music has always been through this pseudo-nostalgic lens of rave”. He also neglects to mention that he was the lead singer of ‘fight pop’ indie outfit, Dananananaykroyd. “We toured for about 6 years non-stop with nothing to show for it. We called it a day and I moved to London. Touring is great: you’re cold, you hate people, you hate yourself. It’s great!”</p>\n<p>One important difference between playing in a band and playing as an electronic musician is the pay. Bands will often be lucky to get a fiver to cover petrol. But there is a distinct (though not too distinct) attitude towards DJs and producers. “It’s insane, why does anyone do it? Maybe the value of the crowd is taken into account. Maybe dancing is considered more profitable than moshing I guess, I don’t know. I hope not.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4453/26295488559_88f0953b13_b.jpg\" alt=\"com\"></p>\n<p>Perhaps the answer is a lot more simple: electronic music is simply in vogue. And like all trends, will soon come crashing down. “I kind of hope that stops soon. It will be fun to see what happens when electronic music goes out of fashion again.” Although live contexts differ, indie and electronic music labels alike can all agree there’s no money to be found in running a label like there used to be. Maybe that’s a good thing.</p>\n<p>“I don’t really think it’s possible to sustain yourself from a label these days. It’s a hobby for me. One that I do alongside working full-time. Some people save up their disposable income for clothes and holidays. I spend mine on making cassettes [laughs].”</p>\n<p>What would happen to Calum Gunn if electronic music did some crashing down? A Dananananaykroyd reunion tour? “Yeah [laughs]. Guys! I think we can do it this time! I can’t remember the words but fuck it!”</p>\n<p>Conditional's latest release, <em>Pocket Protection</em>, is available now as a limited edition cassette <a href=\"http://shop.conditional.club/album/pocket-protection\">on Bandcamp</a>.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1154692536/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=2204344952/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://shop.conditional.club/album/expanding-and-overwriting\">Expanding and overwriting by Daniel M Karlsson</a></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Michał Andrysiak.</em></p>\n<p>Maiko Okimoto aka Lemna has had an interesting history. Through 2010-2012 she deployed her skills as a vocalist under the name Key MC, supporting releases by fringe D&amp;B artists looking to push the bracket of what's possible at a 160 BPM+ tempo, such as ENA and Naibu.</p>\n<p>With this background and a new found interest in live-performed, bilious techno, it's little wonder she has found her latest home on Berlin-based label Horo. Along with Hidden Hawaii and a handful of others, Horo are one of the few imprints to bridge the gap between D&amp;B and the German capital's best-loved export.</p>\n<p>Titled 'Urge Theory', this release makes up Okimoto's second contribution to the label following on from a collaborative release with Auxiliary's Sam KDC under the name Ourea.</p>\n<p>In many ways, this latest release is more of the same, but there's no denying it's meticulously crafted. One of the most impressive things about the EP is that Okimoto seems to use nothing more than an assortment of drums and percussive hits. The release is a viciously frenetic collection of phasing polyrhythms. 'DLPFC' stutters and tremors constantly, hyperactive snares twitching above churning low-end. This theme is only broken when we reach the closer, 'Blot', which centres around a groaning monotone bass note; like the bows of a ship caught in a storm and struggling to retain their structure.</p>\n<p>Okimoto has found a good match with Horo, and vice-versa. The way in which she forms her tracks differentiates 'Urge Theory' from the endless churn of Berlin techno. Okimoto eschews traditional drops, for something for mature and complex in structure. It feels like you are constantly forced one step in front of where the track is headed - giving a feeling not dissimilar to deja vu.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/361183942&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/podcasts/0070-chloe-frieda\">Chloe Frieda</a>'s 'Alien Jams' imprint presents <em>Home Listener</em>, the new EP from Wilted Woman. For the past five years, Alien Jams has been growing as a platform for &quot;strange and beautiful sounds&quot;. First with their fortnightly NTS show and then a flurry of left-field 12&quot;s, including music from <a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/podcasts/112039181978\">Marreck</a>, <a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/reviews/cutoff\">rkss</a> and a split between <a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/podcasts/0070-chloe-frieda\">Beatrice Dillon &amp; Karen Gwyer</a>. As the name suggests, Alien Jams presents dance music, grooves to &quot;jam&quot; to, but not as we know it. Each release holds an ethereal strangeness, which puts it right at the brink of dance-floor acceptability.  The imprint synthesises the falsely-dichotomised 'brain-music' &amp; 'body-music'. After all, we shouldn't have to choose.</p>\n<p>I first encountered Wilted Woman at a <a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/articles/that-time-when-siren\">SIREN</a> showcase in February, hosted in the now closed '1 Silver Road', a former industrial water tank in Lewisham. The walls here are orange with rust and the air inside is dead and cold. It was a fitting venue for an artist who incorporates music concrète and static noise into her sets. Her music has a dead, bitter, hopeless quality. A sound she describes as &quot;graveyard soundscapes&quot; or “anxiety rhythm”.</p>\n<p>This new EP continues this icy anxiety, and opens with the appropriately named 'Heating Problem'. Indeed, the 'Home' in <em>Home Listener</em> is far from the warmth of domestic familiarity. It is an alien place, closer to the home of E.T or the dreamlike surrealism of <em>La Planète Sauvage</em>. It sounds like a spaceship control panel gone awol.

    "content": "<p>The first thing that struck me about this release was the artwork. It could be a Man Ray portrait; in some ways cinematic and evocative of times gone by, yet it also has this densely oversaturated texture which gives it a surreal, alien quality. A film noir classic that’s been played on VHS one too many times, churning up the image until you’re not sure whether you’re looking at a real face or some kind of synthetic reimagining.</p>\n<p>Released on Knives, an imprint run collaboratively by Planet Mu's Kuedo and Joe Shakespeare, 'Organn' is a tumultuous release. It takes inspiration from Isidore-Lucien Ducasse's <em>Les Chants de Maldoror</em>, a poetic novel which was the only text released under his pseudonym, 'Comte de Lautréamont'. Despite this it went on to be a major influence on the surrealist movement, cited by artists like Salvador Dalí, Marcel Duchamp as well as Man Ray.</p>\n<p>The book centres around Maldoror, a misanthrope and nihilist, who is described as &quot;a figure of absolute evil&quot; having &quot;renounced conventional morality and decency&quot;. Yet given these macabre themes as a starting point, 'Organn' is perhaps a more delicate and complex release than might be expected.</p>\n<p>Some elements feel retrograde, as if you are viewing them through an opaque, sepia-toned lense, while others feel mercilessly future-oriented. ‘Consumed’ sees crushing waves of static-doused vocals reach rousing climaxes amid tortured strings and delicate piano tones, while ‘Languish’ puts an entire symphony through the compactor, expelling a jagged block of lurching modem grit and glitched-out heart monitors.</p>\n<p>'Asthme' is perhaps the best example of the conflicted moods contained within the release. The ruptured thrusts of low-end which puncture the mix intermittently are nothing short of pure viciousness, as are the tinnitus-inducing blasts of distortion-cranked glitch. Yet there are mournful vocal manipulations and timid keys hidden amongst the chaos; hinting that maybe between the violence and despair, there is something more fragile and empathetic at play.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/342865402&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p>In today's contemporary clubs, we find fragmented, sporadic, acclerationist music. We find music with squeaky clean pop vocal samples, cartoonish sound effects and mashed-up sound collage. These are sounds with a social conscience attached to them: made to represent &amp; critique our diminishing attention spans and insatiable need for speed. When our anxiety surrounding Internet depersonalisation and late capitalism gets too much to bear, we turn to Pan, Janus and NON to parody our world and offer spiritual release.</p>\n<p>But there is also an undercurrent of bedroom producers who are representing our current situation in a different way. Instead of extreme fragmentation and pop parody, sound is reduced to its bare, raw waveform elements. Listen, for example, to the releases of SM-LL or Conditional. Here, you find a new, though no less recognisable, expression of our zeitgeist: one that is endlessly repetitious, to the point of madness. Anyone who has worked in the most tedious of today's work — factory work, office work —  can identify with the droll monotony of PiL or Throbbing Gristle. Their live performances are listless plods towards the last syllable of recorded time. But today's monotony is electric. Sameness manifests through copy &amp; paste, loop and sequence.</p>\n<p>One such bedroom producer, tuuun aka Stephen McEvoy, comes from this tradition. In his own words, the tuuun project represents an &quot;attempt at tying together lots of different things: techno, rave, repetition, minimalism, elasticity, noise and lots else besides.&quot; McEvoy continues, &quot;I want to use these influences as entry points into sound and music, take them in new directions, and hopefully come up with something exciting. I make a lot of my music through just jamming and improvising in a playful way, and really enjoy just putting down a couple of sounds and letting them talk to each other, and try to have fun with that.&quot;</p>\n<p>McEvoy has also just launched a new label, <a href=\"https://flufrecs.bandcamp.com/\">FLUF</a>, to release a wide range of these new experiments. &quot;FLUF is really an extension of my own personality&quot;, he goes on. &quot;Light-hearted but deadly serious at the same time.&quot; This is certainly true: tuuun is not music you can dance to, but it's also not music without a sense of humour. &quot;I try not to have any preconceived ideas about what the sound of FLUF is, because invariably someone will send me some crazy music that I love, and I’ll want to put it out, which will drag FLUF in directions that I could not have imagined.&quot;</p>\n<p>The name 'FLUF' suggests all filler no killer, but this must be an in-joke of some kind, because is the music is anything but. Their latest series takes on the 'AA' format: 2 tracks, each the mirror image of the other. Absolutely no 'fluff' to be found here. McEvoy continues: &quot;It’s a really great outlet for me to work with other people, and I feel that once you put out some music with an artist, you have a shared bond that feels quite special. Originally, I intended FLUF as a way of just putting out my own music, but it’s recently started to grow beyond that, which is really exciting for me.&quot; And growing it is, as they have just released their third EP this month.</p>\n<p>When I first asked McEvoy about doing a mix, he explained that he is &quot;most definitely not a DJ&quot; and doesn't listen to enough music &quot;to justify a proper mix&quot;. Instead, we have been treated to something a lot more interesting: a recording of a live-set. &quot;I love performing live, it’s the most fun I can have as a musician, as I get to be playful with my sounds in a more long-form way, but with the added pressure of trying to keep it cohesive as a whole. It’s a really enjoyable kind of challenge&quot;.

    "content": "<p>It’s rare for a label to make such a strong impression in so short a time frame as Athenian outfit Hypermedium, especially considering that they have had just three releases to date. The imprint was founded in 2015 by Akis Sinos and Timos Alexandropoulous, after the pair met at a festival they were both working on at the time.</p>\n<p>After discovering they had common musical and artistic interests, they started to collaborate, working on gigs and playing together. When asked about the label’s founding, they elaborate on how the project developed: “A couple of years ago we started having more concrete ideas about the music we would like to release, focusing on contemporary electronic music; whether this be computer music, noise collages, more club-oriented sounds or excursions into futurism. At that point, Roc [Jiménez de Cisneros] and Steve [Sharp] from EVOL were kind enough to give us some of their new material. We were more than happy to make a 12” out of it, so this became HMDM001, ‘Melting Pinkness’. This is how Hypermedium came into being.”</p>\n<p>Those familiar with EVOL will know the pair chart some rather unconventional territory, defining their sound as “computer music for hooligans”. Their release for Hypermedium pushed this mission statement to the limit; a demonic amalgamation of vocodered wails and amphetamine charged acid-riffs combining like a SEGA Mega Drive console gone haywire.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/197173108&color=%23c80684&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p>Earlier this year I was lucky enough to catch Hypermedium’s showcase at FASMA festival; subjecting myself to EVOL’s bizarre square wave symphonies first hand. In a concrete bunker filled thick with smoke, EVOL’s work soundtracked crazed technicolour lasers, painting mottled plates of bright pink, green and blue through the fog. “I think for a lot of people it must have been a shock, coming down to that dark, smoke-covered basement while EVOL were playing”, Akis and Timos reflect when asked about the occasion. “A night to remember for a few people we know. We met EVOL five years ago when we invited them for a live set here. Back then Hypermedium didn’t exist, but we became friends with them over the years.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div><p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BTwb1hkgdLd/\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Stray Landings (@straylandings)</a> on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2017-05-06T15:59:31+00:00\">May 6, 2017 at 8:59am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script>\n<p>Since their founding, Hypermedium have gained interest internationally, yet the duo highlight how running a label in the Greek capital is no simple undertaking. “To an outsider it may seem like Athens is bursting with energy but to be honest, we’d say things still get done on a quite superficial level”, they begin on the topic. “As far as certain issues are concerned, things are even worse than they used to be. A lot of record stores and spaces that were important points of reference for the Athenian crowd have closed down and budgets are continuously shrinking. Most people are working on an extremely tight budget, so most of the times it seems impossible to organise something bigger and to invite people from abroad. Lack of substantial funding, support or plain interest means that pretty much everything is still running on a more-or-less DIY basis. Having a steady spot to be able to work and build a crowd or a following on a long term basis is quite rare. On the other hand there’s certainly much better music coming out of the city lately, with a lot of people and crews making great stuff and demonstrating much higher competence than ever before.”</p>\n<p>Going on to discuss the trials and tribulations of running a label more generally, the pair are equally candid about the difficulties. “I think most people would agree that starting a vinyl label is a great challenge in its own right, to begin with. It’s really hard to sustain financially; even harder when you run a label that is based on the periphery of the main centres of activity; like London, Berlin, etc. On top of that you could add the enormous cost of running and maintaining a proper business in Greece nowadays – whether it’s a label, a shop or any sort of enterprise. This might give you the whole picture.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4517/38411000476_bbe0c1dd47_b.jpg\" alt=\"e\"></p>\n<p><em>Akis Sinos at Les Yper Yper, 2015.</em></p>\n<p>Despite their unflinching realism about the hardships of running Hypermedium, the pair not only manage to sustain the label but also find time to work on their own projects too. The second release in their catalogue came in the form of a split release from Patiño and No God Ritual; a moniker of Timos’. His contribution to the release is reminiscent of Gábor Lázár’s collaborations with Mark Fell, pitting frenetic additive synth modulations against razor-edged drum-machine patterns and vaporous expulsions of low-end. Recently, he also played alongside Actress under his Xyn Cabal moniker in Manchester.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/315878684&color=%23222122&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p>Akis and Timos’ musical interests haven’t always been electronic-focused however. They were both into punk and metal in their younger years, getting into experimental music later as they began to mix with like-minded people. “As time went by we became more and more involved with different aspects of club culture” they explain. “Arriving there from a totally different background was quite refreshing and it opened up a whole new set of possibilities that really refined the way we engaged with music, both as listeners and musicians.”</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/282880615&color=%238a8a8a&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p>The pair are keen to stress that it would be difficult to cite any specific examples of projects that have influenced the label, as Hypermedium is the result of years of listening and thinking about music. The imprint is inspired by a complex web of cross-pollination, which appears to still be going on. Most recently, they released ‘The Rise of Gqom’, by South African gqom collective AudioBoyz. “The whole gqom wave came as a blast for us” they assert when asked about how the release came together. “We were big fans of their first record on Blank Mind, regularly playing their tracks in our sets. When we were discussing what’s next for Hypermedium it made total sense for us to include a record with them. We managed to find their contact details and after some discussion they were totally into the idea. The whole procedure was more than smooth and we’re totally happy with the record. They’re working really hard on their music so we’re confident that there’s a lot more to come from them in the future.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4522/38448394366_96cfc4f136_b.jpg\" alt=\"g\"></p>\n<p><em>'The Rise of Gqom' by Audioboyz, 2017.</em></p>\n<p>In terms of the label’s next movements, there are upcoming releases from Mexican artist Siete Catorce and Gang of Ducks signee Dave Saved already confirmed. “Siete’s ‘Paisajes’ EP on Enchufada had been stuck in our heads for a long time” they reveal when asked on how the releases come together. “We further explored his music and short online exchanges led to the collaboration. After that there’s a split release coming up between Dave Saved and NPLGNN. They first appeared together on the Eternal Flame cassette last year on their Forever Now imprint and we immediately got hooked. We asked them if they would be interested in further investigating the concept they initially started with their cassette, as we feel that this is something closely related to our ideas. We’re expecting this to come to fruition in mid-2018.</p>\n<p>“That said, we feel that it’s important to emphasise that although we always get in touch with artists we admire to discuss a prospective collaboration, we give them total freedom to work on their music and vision. Just because we enjoyed their previous work doesn’t mean we expect something similar to that.”</p>\n<p><em>Visit Hypermedium's <a href=\"http://hypermedium.org/\">website</a> to stay up to date with their next movements.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/347087014&color=%238a8a8a&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p>If we should be thankful for anything from the 90s UK pop culture, it should be rave. Rave culture can be a hard one to describe. ‘Rave’ can often hold a broad definition, encircling any and all culture related to nightclubs or to dancing. But there is a specific 90s trend in music that ‘rave’ is home to. Inspired by the Ibiza clubs and the development of house and techno in Chicago and Detroit, rave parties and rave records began appearing in the UK at the turn of the decade. They were high-octane, anarchistic, and fuelled by kilos of MDMA. Imagine 20,000 people dancing in a field to repetitive breakbeat on a dodgy homemade sound system off the M25. That was the spirit of rave. And although seemingly trivial, this odd historical moment  sparked an explosion of dance music throughout 90s. The format of rave was ultimately responsible for the development of acid, jungle, speed garage and bassline: 4 of the UK’s most honoured national treasures.</p>\n<p>One common criticism of rave was its apolitical bent. In some ways, rave seemed decidedly anti-political. Ravers simply had no demands besides a space to dance and the decriminalisation of E. History, it would seem, had ended. All we could do now was party. But this is an unfair portrayal. One of the first illegal warehouse parties in the UK was the legendary R.I.P club. It’s said that the majority of the attendees thought the club’s name was an abbreviation of ‘Rave In Peace’. It was actually ‘Revolution In Progress’. But what was this revolution that they were aiming for? One political aim of rave was to counter the Thatcherite “virtues” of the 80s: austerity, providence and tightening ones belt for the future. Suddenly, living hand-to-mouth, in the here-and-now became a political goal worth fighting for.</p>\n<p>Is there a sense in which we have forgotten how to enjoy ourselves? Should we, as Simon Reynolds asks, “make of joy once more a crime against the state”? On this month’s Resonance FM show, we talked to DB1 and our Resonance studio engineer, George Rayner-Law about RAVE: its music, its culture, ‘the hardcore continuum’ and fighting for the right to party.</p>\n<p>###Tracklist:</p>\n<p>Akzidenz - Legacy Support <br>\nDouble 99 - RIP Groove <br>\nDB1 - Feld <br>\nHead High - RAVE <br>\nZomby - Float <br></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&light=1&feed=%2FResonance%2Fstray-landings-23rd-november-2017%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>",

Carbone and Lucindo Cutolo – have released a sequence of impressive obscurantist 12&quot;s and cassettes over the past few years. Like many strains of contemporary dance music, their aesthetic dwells in the darker shadows of the club. Their focus is not so much on the 'woo!'s and 'yeah!'s of carefree party music, but on techno's psychic intensity: its capacity for nightmarish hallucinations and bad trips.</p>\n<p>The same could be said for Ontal: a name I always thought of as a truncation of 'ontology of the brutal'.

    "content": "<p>I met Fredrik Nilsson, aka A.O.T in person once at Norbergfestival in 2015. I had a disposable camera with me, which he advised I use by taking snaps at random; holding at waist height, an extended arms length to the side or above - basically anything possible to avoid regular perspectives.</p>\n<p>Reflecting on Nilsson's music, it seems there are some parallels here. He has touched on a broad range of genres, from dub-techno to ambient, jungle, drum and bass and dubstep. He's even remixed Evanescence. The common thread is Nilsson does his upmost to put the listener somewhere awkward and unconventional; the references are familiar, but the viewpoint is totally new.</p>\n<p>His latest offering is 'Alternativ Jul', a cassette release on Rundgång Records. Here, the Malmö-based artist offers everything from the jaunty distortion funk of 'Dans kring granen' to 15 minute dub-forest epic, 'Annandag djungel'. The former grunts and contorts with stop-motion style discord, each element overdriven to breaking point. In comparison the latter is a meditative, soul-searching affair, calling to mind the likes of T++ or Demdike Stare.</p>\n<p>Sandwiched between these two offerings we are treated to two burnout percussive assaults. 'Jungle Bells' is a tarmac-shredding slab of dense atmospherics and pulverising low-end, while 'Elaka Tomten' darts from the starting blocks with powerhouse kicks and unsettling pinch resonances.</p>\n<p>For a four-track cassette, its fair to say you get your money's worth with 'Alternativ Jul'. There is half an hour of music here, and as usual Nilsson's approach to dance genres of all shapes and sizes offers ingenuity and oddball quirks at every turn. An exhilarating ride as ever.</p>\n<p>Read our review of A.O.T's Rundgång EP on SonuoS <a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/reviews/rundgang\">here</a>.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1537920234/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://rundgng.bandcamp.com/album/a-o-t-alternativ-jul\">A.O.T - Alternativ Jul by A.O.T</a></iframe>",

At the time, Arkbro was known to some as one of the many young Swedes engaged in Stockholm’s bustling experimental electronic scene. Three foundational institutions (EMS, Fylkingen and the Royal College of Music) have produced a fertile ground out of which budding musicians can blossom. Caterina Barbieri, Yair Elazar Glotman, Mats Erlandsson, Maria W Horn, Daniel M Karlsson, Sissel Wincent, Kali Malone and many more all seem to have grown out of this environment.  Consequently, we have the Drömfakulteten imprint, the ‘Stockholm Drone Society’ and the crown jewel of Stockholm electronic scene: Norbergfestival.</p>\n<p>Brian Eno coined the term 'scenius' to describe moments like this, as “the intelligence and the intuition of a whole cultural scene [...] the communal form of the concept of the genius.” A uniquely modern trend in music, particularly from electronic music and DJ culture, trades the role of the lone 'tortured artist'-\ntype pioneer for a collective hodgepodge of innovation: from 'gene' to 'scene'. In other words, Stockholm seems to have the enviable status of having an actual community. Perhaps if London gave similar attention to its arts funding, it wouldn’t feel so atomised by comparison.</p>\n<p>Arkbro’s initial experiments on texture, tone and timbre can be found on Soundcloud, catalogued by their date of creation and nothing else. This is the world so many musicians start in: self-uploaded tidbits and experimental obscurities. Not much else on Arkbro was in the public domain before this year, so I guess I was kind of surprised to hear something like <em>For Organ &amp; Brass</em> as a debut full length release. Because this is an ambitious, mammoth record. The kind of thing you release at the height of a career, instead of at its beginning.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2469736947/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=e99708/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=3848344949/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://ellenarkbro.bandcamp.com/album/for-organ-and-brass\">For organ and brass by Ellen Arkbro</a></iframe>\n<p>At first pass, it’s easy to get distracted by the novel aspects of this album. The opening piece uses a 400-year-old organ, tuned to the subtle but seductive ‘meantone temperament’. This is a tuning rarely heard. It sounds kind of 'rounded out' and warped. In meantone, a chord on its own feels more spherical than usual: a tensionless harmony of frequencies. But try transitioning to any standard cadence and you hear its refracted curvature across the keyboard, like a musical score in a hall of mirrors.</p>\n<p>The composition itself is also extreme in its starkness. A few deep drones loop around with incremental intensity, stretching out over 20 minutes. The first major chord change happens about three quarters in, after over 15 minutes. The cover art is bright and minimal, like a Josef Albers painting. Even its name, <em>For Organ and Brass</em>, recalls the modest functionalism of Baroque and early Classical. This would seem like an album written for a simpler time. But despite its deceptive simplicity, this music has a mysterious sticking power.</p>\n<p>This may be in part due to the album’s emotional character. Its mood is not easy to describe, in part because it evokes two, almost contradictory, psychological states. On first listen, the album has an urgent, imposing quality. If the opening piece, ‘For Organ &amp; Brass’ is a doom horn signalling impending apocalypse, then the closing ‘Three’ is a mournful reflection memorialising the end of history. The album begins with an intense anticipatory energy and concludes with pathos and a fatalistic acceptance. But after many listens, I now also find a cosy, homeliness to the record. Its warm chords and soft textures have become familiar comforts to me. I go back to them again and again for that safe, grounded feeling.</p>\n<p>An album as rich in concept as <em>For Organ and Brass</em> warrants some unpacking and eight months from its release, Subtext have repressed the vinyl. To commemorate the occasion, we caught up with Arkbro to discuss the composition of a modern classic.</p>\n<p><strong>So how has this year been for you? It must be a strange experience to suddenly be in the limelight. I know you’ve been writing music for a while but now it seems like your name is everywhere.</strong></p>\n<p>That’s my feeling as well [laughs]. It’s been quite intense. The most difficult thing is to reorient yourself when you are suddenly put into a completely new situation. Until now, I’ve been more or less alone with my music, then suddenly lots of people who I don’t know are relating to it, suddenly I am not alone in the creative process. That’s a strange thing. It’s also difficult to stay grounded and focused when there are so many things happening and there are so many different directions to go in.</p>\n<p><strong>It must be odd going from a private realm to a very public realm.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah — when you work on an album, and especially when you present it, you tell a story about yourself. And that story may be true to some extent, but it’s not the whole picture, you know? It can be very easy to lock yourself into this one story that you are telling the world. There are so many different stories that you can tell yourself and others about yourself.</p>\n<p><strong>I guess you’ve written lots of music that not many people have heard: pieces for guitar, electronic projects and so on. How did you wind up writing this piece in particular?</strong></p>\n<p>I wrote the organ and brass piece in 2014 for this organ in Stockholm that I found out was tuned in meantone temperament. I didn’t know much about that tuning at the time but I had been interested in tunings and intonation for some time and so I was curious to learn more about the meantone tuning, and I knew I wanted to write something for organ. In most of the music that I had made for guitar and electronics I had attempted to produce an organ-like sound. After a while I just thought, well, maybe I should just compose for an actual organ [laughs]. It was a liberating experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a bit about meantone temperament?</strong></p>\n<p>Since I didn’t know much about the tuning at first, I had to spend some time reading about it and then playing and listening to it. And after a while, I realised that some of the intervals in this tuning resembled, very closely, septimal intervals – the kind of  intervals which La Monte Young famously used in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3eN4xwADTI\"><em>The Well Tuned-Piano</em></a>. The septimal aspect of the meantone temperament is not something which has been recognised historically, at least not that I know of. It is not something one usually learns about when reading about meantone temperament. It is more like a side effect of the tuning favouring pure or in-tune thirds.</p>\n<p>That’s why meantone is normally used – for its beautiful major and minor chords with very clear and still thirds. You get all these interval characteristics by narrowing the fifth slightly, which means that meantone tuning does not have pure fifths. And this is the reason why I added the brass trio, so that the brass could provide all the pure fifths and seconds to the harmony. And I find it interesting that in the end, the sound of the fifths are almost more striking than the septimal intervals in this piece.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4520/38057433304_c506805ac7_h.jpg\" alt=\"horn\"></p>\n<p><strong>So what happened between then and now?</strong></p>\n<p>The piece was put on the shelf for a couple of years. I had a simple recording of that early version of the piece in Stockholm. I showed it to a friend of mine, who was working with James Ginzburg of Subtext. He secretly showed it to James, without my knowledge [laughs]. James got in touch with me and was interested in releasing my music. At the time I couldn’t really imagine how and what music I would be releasing, so it took some time for me to respond. Eventually I presented the idea of recording this piece that he had already heard and immediately it just felt so perfectly right to work on this project together.</p>\n<p>I knew that I wanted to work with the Zinc &amp; Copper brass trio in Berlin, so we decided to do the recording somewhere close to Berlin. At first, it was about finding the right instrument. I thought it would be easy, I assumed that there would be old organs in every corner in Germany but it turned out to be a big project. There were many people involved. Marc Sabat was very helpful and went on a quest to play different organs for me and sent me recordings together with his thoughts about the instrument and the room. Many organs were a bit too small or located in a room that was not suitable and so on. But finally, we found the organ in Tangermünde in Germany. I went there to play it and it just happened to be this incredibly beautiful 400-year-old instrument with the perfect sound.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you arrange horns to sound ‘in tune’ with a meantone organ?</strong></p>\n<p>Well the trombone of course has very flexible intonation. But the horn is a little bit more difficult. To change the intonation on a horn with a nice tone and clear sound, you have to work very hard with your lips and stomach and so on. You mostly have to use your hand inside the cone itself to change the intonation, but that also changes the sound. Robin [Hayward] plays a microtonal tuba, so he is perfectly flexible in intonation.</p>\n<p><strong>When did you first get interested in microtones as a musical device?</strong></p>\n<p>It was when I was introduced to the work of La Monte Young and the classical Indian tradition of raga. While I was studying at the Royal College of Music in Stockholm there was a wave of people making drone music and working with sustained tones. So I was introduced to it by friends, who also provided me with good methods for working with intonation. Very early on in working with electronic sounds I was introduced to SuperCollider, which is a programming environment for sound synthesis. When working in it, there are some very natural ways of working with rational frequency relationships – you are not restricted by having to deviate from something else (as with cent deviations from equal temperament).</p>\n<p>So in a sense, with simple rational frequency relationships you are not really working with microtonality anymore, you are simply dealing with the most basic intervals, sort of taking them for what they really are, as being simple, not as complex deviations. So I believe the context in which I first started making electronic music was already favouring this kind of work with intonation.</p>\n<p><strong>I guess that’s one of the cool things about electronic composition – that you can more readily play with non-standard tunings. The very first synthesisers were very difficult to accurately tune because you just had a frequency dial, whereas with a piano you’re kind of forced to play ‘in tune’.</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, although strictly speaking the piano is not in tune, and I believe the 'out of tune'-ness is a big part of the sound of piano. When you listen to La Monte Young playing <em>The Well-Tuned Piano</em> it sounds like a completely different instrument. It’s the same with electronic sounds. If you have tones that are perfectly in tune, then the tones lock into each other and the sound will change, sometimes quite radically. At some points it can even be an unpleasant experience, but nevertheless an interesting one. A sound that is perfectly in tune is a completely unique kind of sonic experience, unlike anything else.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4533/23909412747_20282d38fc_h.jpg\" alt=\"organ\"></p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a bit about how you play the album live?</strong></p>\n<p>We recently played it in Stockholm, about two weeks ago. It was the premiere. It was a really nice experience — it sounds very different in a big room; it becomes a different piece essentially. We will perform it again at Rewire Festival in the Hague. It’s quite a hard piece to perform because every meantone organ is tuned slightly differently. The organ in Tangermünde was tuned to 486Hz and the one in Stockholm is tuned to 468Hz. And since that isn’t a common reference pitch, I have to write a score in 486Hz or 468Hz and then an additional score transposed to 440Hz for the brass musicians, with all the deviations from conventional intervals of their instruments.</p>\n<p>So for every live performance I have to rewrite the piece and rewrite the score, so that the brass musicians can find their different fingerings. Part of the reason for the difference in tunings is that when they originally built these organs, they used someone’s forearm as a measure for the pipes, so they all vary quite a bit in pitch and tone.</p>\n<p><strong>I didn’t realise you get an actual organ on stage.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, at Rewire we get two pipe organs actually [laughs]. We will be performing <em>For Organ and Brass</em> on a smaller meantone organ and then we will most likely play a new piece including electronics, for a bigger organ tuned in equal temperament. With this piece I just use the fifths and the seconds of the equal temperament and then I add the electronics to make the organ sound more in tune.</p>\n<p><strong>I’ve heard that being at one of your shows can have a weird effect on the ears. Apparently due to the tunings, applause sounds like it’s underwater?! What’s going on there?</strong></p>\n<p>[Laughs] Yeah, I know. It’s weird, but cool. I don’t actually know why that happens, although I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about it. First I thought that it just happened when having listened to these extremely phase-locked tuned sounds. But then I experienced the same thing happen after listening to the recording of <em>For Organ and Brass</em> on a loud volume. I was quite surprised.</p>\n<p><strong>I guess your brain must alter in some way after adjusting to those unusual tunings. I remember reading about My Bloody Valentine’s use of extreme volume on stage and how an extended period of very high volumes can actually lower your neural oscillation frequency and put you into a mild trance state. You get high, basically.</strong></p>\n<p>I once flew to Manchester just to see MBV. I was right at the front with no earplugs. It was an experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Were you using microtones when you were playing guitar too?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, I’ve always been playing with tunings on the guitar, tuning the strings to different chords. But I’ve mostly been playing open strings and harmonics and haven’t really explored how to tune the strings of the guitars so I can play on the frets.</p>\n<p><strong>And the septimal intervals are also used in blues, right?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, blues singers often sing the thirds and the sevenths septimally, a lot lower than in the corresponding equal tempered intervals. It’s this low, heavy, sad sound. Very powerful. I love it. Definitely my favourite kind of interval.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about the ‘Mountain of Air’ piece you did after the album was released?</strong></p>\n<p>If I’m perfectly honest, the people I worked with got a little bit paranoid that the two pieces on the <em>For Organ &amp; Brass</em> record weren’t “enough” somehow, and I guess I went a little bit paranoid too. Releasing an album can make you go a bit crazy I guess. It felt like going into a bubble and not knowing at all how to relate to the material. Like does it even sound good? Is this interesting? I don’t know. You feel too close to it and too far away from it to know how to relate to it. And I believe that feeling is even stronger when you work with such a reduced material, because if you start to doubt the sound or the chord that you chose, it feels like there’s nothing left.</p>\n<p>So that’s why I started working with the recordings, to see if I could create something different with it. I remember opening SuperCollider and just putting in random numbers for playback speed and durations of overlapping parts of the brass recordings. I ran the code and this came out of the speakers. I thought that it meant that this material was really flexible so I tried going back to adjust some parts but the initial random numbers that I entered happened to be the only numbers that worked. So, I don’t really feel like I composed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAswI824RA\">that piece</a>, it just appeared somehow [laughs].</p>\n<p><strong>It kind of feels like Stockholm is at a very important musical juncture right now. There’s been so much great music coming out of the city in the last 12 months, it’s hard to keep up with.</strong></p>\n<p>Stockholm has been a very important place to me. I wouldn’t do what I do today if it weren’t for this context in Stockholm, these wonderful people around me. EMS is indeed an amazing place. You can basically go there and ring the doorbell, not knowing anything about electronic music, and get access to these amazing studios. You first have to go through a couple of courses learning Pro Tools and about electroacoustic music history and then you have access to the studios for lifetime. Fylkingen is also an important place.</p>\n<p>There’s definitely a strong sense of community here, that you can feel more or less part of, of course. People are generally very serious about what they do. And even more importantly, I feel surrounded by artists and musicians who are clearly defined in their endeavours. It makes you want to be more transparent in your own practice and that is very inspiring.</p>\n<p><em>'For Organ &amp; Brass' re-issue is now available on Subtext.

    "content": "<p>For 12 years, Ipek Gorgun filled the role of bassist and vocalist for rough-edged post-rock group Bedroomdrunk. These days her musical pursuits lean a little more towards the academic. Raised in Ankara, Turkey, she studied as part of the Redbull Music Academy in 2014, affording her the opportunity to support Ryoji Ikeda in Tokyo for his 'Test Pattern [n°6]' show. Most recently, she enroled at Istanbul Technical University, studying on their Sonic Arts doctoral program and in March, she released <em>Aphelion</em> on Touch, a label that has played host to some of contemporary electronic music’s most notable artists, including Mika Vainio, Fennesz and Jacaszek.</p>\n<p>Where <em>Aphelion</em> looked to the outer reaches of electronic music, featuring meditative resonances, science-fiction style sound design and crescendo distortions, her most recent project opts for a different tack. Written in collaboration with David Psutka aka Egyptrixx (operating under his new guise Ceramic TL), <em>Perfect Lung</em> acts as a dazzling kaleidoscope of synthetic abstractions; lively dulcet tones and reverberant chimes conjuring vibrant anime-reminiscent landscapes.</p>\n<p>With the album released in late November, we invited Ipek to contribute to our ‘That Time When’ series, to discuss some of her most memorable gigging experiences, from converting to punk in the late ’90s to throwing a bar of chocolate at Blixa Bargeld…</p>\n<p>###1 New Model Army at Complex  Club,  Ankara _ 1999</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4725/38324473134_2a79385df6_b.jpg\" alt=\"a\"></p>\n<p>I was 15 years old and slowly warming to punk rock by listening to a lot of Riot Grrrl stuff. However, I was especially interested in New Model Army (NMA) as I felt their sound and lyrics extended beyond any definition I had at that time for punk rock. I was not going to officially learn what post-punk was until I turned 17 years old.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t very often we’d have international bands in Ankara, so the NMA gig was a huge opportunity for me to hear music outside the local scene - it was also my first ‘real’ concert experience.</p>\n<p>Long story short: I made a fake pass to enter, NMA blew me away (I still get goosebumps thinking about it), and the next day I shaved the sides of my head and got myself a mohawk, lifted a spiked dog leash from a pet shop to use as a choker (our local shop was only selling heavy metal t-shirts and pins that year), drank my first vodka and fell in love with a skinny punk boy two months later. Hello adolescence!</p>\n<p>###2 Einsturzende Neubauten at Maslak  Venue, Istanbul _ 2004</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4556/24175074697_4f3307760b_b.jpg\" alt=\"q\"></p>\n<p>This is the concert that I threw a bar of chocolate to Blixa Bargeld. Oh my god. He asked the audience for a cigarette and everyone threw theirs to the stage. I had left my pack at home and chocolate was all I had…</p>\n<p>Blixa read the brand out loud with a perfect Turkish accent (“Dido sütlü çikolata”), laughed and threw the chocolate back at the audience. A month later I wrote to a local forum that I was the one who threw it, and a girl texted me saying she had the chocolate and she’s keeping it. We met, drank some tea and ate it.</p>\n<p>It was their Perpetuum Mobile tour. Even though I have a deep affection for all of their pre-<em>Ende Neu</em> era, I loved every second of Perpetuum Mobile as well. And when it comes to Neubauten, maybe it’s not a matter of era. It’s a matter of getting deeper into contemplating different layers of humanity, nature, existence, technology and the universe.</p>\n<p>I knew from the documentary 'Liebeslieder' about the extremes they go to in live performances. This time they did not literally set the stage on fire as they almost did once, but yeah, metaphorically it was on fire. The bagpipe-compressors, tubular bells, vibrators on guitars, chains on cymbals and Blixa’s one-of-a-kind growls and screams… I witnessed it all, and was amazed by how they explored the possibilities of instruments. It was one of those lecture-like gigs, and I never wanted it to end.</p>\n<p>###3 Katie Jane Garside with Queen Adreena at Ankara _ 2004</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4635/38324473024_88e5d85206_b.jpg\" alt=\"q\"></p>\n<p>Well I can’t remember the name of the venue, but I sure as hell remember every moment of that concert. As I’ve said before, Riot Grrrls warmed me to punk rock. I was more of a Daisy Chainsaw fan than Queen Adreena, but when I heard they were in town, I had to go. The band was amazing as well, with their best line-up including Crispin Gray, Melanie Garside and Pete Howard.</p>\n<p>Katie Jane Garside has been one of my all-time heroes. To me she’s more than a brilliant, unique singer with a voice to die for. She’s also an amazing performance artist, a poet, a sailor and a daydreamer. Garside on stage is a combination of all these, and I was struck by how fragile she seemed and yet how strong she was, drawing all the energy in the room, digesting it and throwing it back to us. We surrendered and gave a piece of ourselves to Katie that night. But she gave it all.</p>\n<p>###4 Tim Hecker at Amberplatform, Istanbul _ 2010</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4730/24175074887_49078aac29_b.jpg\" alt=\"rr\"></p>\n<p>Well it was my ‘go’ moment when I first heard of Courtney Love calling all the girls to pick up a guitar and start screaming. So I picked up a bass, taught myself how to play it and worked with a band called Bedroomdrunk for 12 years as a bass player and a singer.</p>\n<p>My second ‘go’ moment was when I heard Tim Hecker live in a deserted building in Karaköy - Istanbul, which was transformed into a club for a two-day electronic music festival. Bedroomdrunk was going to be over in a couple years, I was about to apply for the doctoral program of Sonic Arts, trying to learn how to use Ableton and Max MSP, but I lacked the confidence to get deep into composition on my own.</p>\n<p>I discovered Tim Hecker’s work back in 2006, and somehow his music led me to Fennesz, Stephan Mathieu and Oren Ambarchi as well. Hearing him live was something that I had been waiting for for quite some time. The building was so old we thought it might collapse. Then he started playing and we thought it might really collapse. Witnessing his crazy skill of mixing and improvising is something else, but what impressed me beyond that was the amount of control he maintained even at the loudest, heavily distorted parts of his performance. On the one hand, he was letting it go and making the sound feel alive, but on the other hand, he was sculpting each moment carefully. It was a type of mastership that I’m still trying to improve as a young composer.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/346415560&color=%23788078&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Rumour has it Seth Troxler was knocked off his no.1 spot on Resident Advisor’s annual DJ chart this year, triggering uproar at the RA offices. As an act of peaceful protest, they declined to publish their end of year list until Troxler reaches his rightful spot once more.</p>\n<p>In 2017, end-of-year lists <em>do</em> seem a little passe. Experience of music today just doesn’t lend itself to indexes and checklists. In the age of the internet, music can come at you from all directions: from trending social media to Bandcamp obscurities. As a consequence, we are often rewarded with unexpected listening experiences. Genres you once hated with burning fervour now have a certain charm. Maybe you have been too close-minded to appreciate the nuances of Ukranian hardstyle. In the right context, novel music can leave you spinning off into a new world of interest, like a dreidel ricocheting from a table leg.</p>\n<p>But a <em>list</em>, neatly compiled into an easily-digestible sequence, just doesn’t pair with the non-linearity of hearing new music. Unless you are some Austin Powers figure, cryogenically unfrozen in the future and wanting an historical record of what was popular in 2017, a list of the year’s ‘best’ albums is kind of lackluster. At its peak, an end-of-year list only represents a seemingly random collective of unconnected music from writers of divergent tastes: a horse designed by committee.</p>\n<p>In the past, we've tried to negate this by ending the year with a list of highlights we have failed to cover over the past 12 months. These articles functioned like a kind of annual apology to music we forgot to cover, either through laziness or cultural lag. Highlighting our own incompetence may not be best practice, but to say nothing at the end of a year of superb music would be a great discredit to many. There is simply too much going on; too many unpaid hours of artistic labour and devotion not to be recognised.</p>\n<p>One of the first things to note is that we haven’t seen a cultural renaissance in ‘political’ music as many had predicted. A number of grizzled commentators in the British press have expressed their bemusement at the political engagement of ‘young people’ this year (whatever that means). Where, they ask, are the protest songs of the Brexit-Trump generation? Where are the righteous battle-cries of sprightly Corbynistas? With the notable exception of ‘Grime for Corbyn’ and ‘Grime for Grenfell’, these anthems simply don’t exist. Maybe their rarity is a blessing. God help us if the Billy Bragg of vapourwave turns up. Perhaps political energy is better spent elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Indeed, although there may have been few political <em>anthems</em>, we are not short of political <em>agents</em>. This year has seen an increased scrutiny of club culture’s internal structures and social hierarchies. Venues, festivals and big-name artists have been increasingly under the spotlight (or ‘called out’) for their bullshit. In particular, London’s new wave of pseudo-pirate broadcasters: Radar Radio, Balamii and Boiler Room.</p>\n<p>The obvious and by now well-known example is Radar Radio’s founder being the son of Sports Direct owner, business cowboy and fireplace vomiter Mike Ashley. The relationship extends beyond familial ties however, with Radar bailed out of <a href=\"http://joshajhall.tumblr.com/post/157482866012/radar-radio-and-sports-direct\">staggering debts</a> by a company in which Mike Ashley holds his shares in both Sports Direct and Newcastle United. The whole affair leaves a bit of a bad taste in the mouth when paired with their ‘footwork’ series: a monthly blog advertising the latest trends in <a href=\"http://www.radarradio.com/blog/footwork-november-2017-collab-astro-boy-timbaland-wtaps-wang-adidas-kith-jordan-vans\">footwear</a>.</p>\n<p>An article from 2013 also resurfaced this year, detailing a horrific incident involving Balamii Radio’s founder and head, James Browning. Browning had his own ties to big finance, having lost his job as a city stock broker after violently <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/drunk-city-broker-slammed-taxi-drivers-head-in-cab-door-after-jumping-fare-8791129.html\">assaulting a taxi driver</a> on a night out, after refusing to pay a fair. The gravity of the incident extends far beyond drunken masculine bravado, leaving the cab driver in need of plastic surgery after having his head slammed in the cab door. In an <a href=\"https://www.theransomnote.com/music/interviews/balamii-talks/\">interview</a> earlier in the year with Browning, Ransom Note stated that, “community is at the heart of everything [Balamii] do”, a claim now cast in some doubt.</p>\n<p>The issue surrounding Boiler Room and Notting Hill carnival and their boring, predictable response has been widely discussed and criticised this year. Anyone who needs a catch-up can find a succinct and truthful summary over at the fabulous <a href=\"http://www.gal-dem.com/boiler-room-and-the-issue-of-white-men/\">Gal-Dem page</a>. Reflecting on it now, it is genuinely startling how fast an institution can buckle under its own weight. When I was first getting into dance music, I used to watch their pixelated webcam streams in the hope of hearing a new James Blake dubplate. In 2017, they were spending part of their £300k Arts Council funding on branded lighters with a bottle opener on it.</p>\n<p>Progress, it seems, must come from elsewhere. One place to look is the increase of events for and by women and non-binary people. In London, UNITI deliver some of the city’s most vibrant parties, leaving many of the major new venues, such as the colossal Printworks and its conservative (read: patriarchal) booking policy, trailing behind. Many new projects are also making reparations for systemic imbalances in music tech. Music Hackspace and Synaptic Island have been offering coding and DJ workshops specifically for people of oppressed genders.</p>\n<p>Of the more interesting ‘big venues’ in London, the Barbican Centre has afforded the chance to see a number of artists on the 'before you die' list. Earlier this month I was lucky enough to witness Leyland Kirby’s unique showmanship first hand, drinking a bottle of Jameson and miming along to a couple of sluggishly processed '30s ballroom tracks before stumbling his way off stage in a special Caretaker performance in tribute to the brilliant, and now sadly departed, Mark Fisher. Many fans of Fisher’s writing have also been revisiting his acclaimed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/18/mark-fisher-k-punk-blogs-did-48-politics\">K-Punk</a> blogs this year.</p>\n<p>Wolfgang Voigt also dusted off the GAS project for a performance of <em>Narkopop</em>; the first album he has released under the alias for a good 15 years. There was also a performance of Philip Glass’ <em>Music in Twelve Parts</em>, in its full five hour glory. Where else can you find this? Their run looks set to continue too, with Alva Noto and Anne-James Chaton already booked in for 2018.</p>\n<p>Anyone who has been following Stray Landings this year may have also noticed a preoccupation for all things Swedish. This is in part for actually having visited Stockholm this summer and its powerhouse institutions (Norbergfestival, EMS, Fylkingen). But there has also been a staggering volume of releases coming from the city and its descendants. At the start of the year, we had Ellen Arkbro’s iconic <em>For Organ &amp; Brass</em>, an album which has been on endless repeat for me since its release. Many will also have heard Caterina Barbieri’s bright and brilliant <em>Patterns of Consciousness</em>, an album that arguably overshadowed another from Barbieri, written and recorded alongside Carlo Maria under their ‘Punctum’ moniker at EMS. This album, <em>Remote Sensing</em>, is a far moodier vision in comparison to Barbieri’s solo record, but remains the dark horse of the two.</p>\n<p>We also had two brilliant LPs from Yair Elazar Glotman: <em>Compound</em> on Subtext and <em>Negative Chambers</em> with Mats Erlandsson. If that wasn’t enough, we were treated to two Swedish releases on Conditional (on whom more later) from Maria W Horn and Daniel M Karlsson. With so much of 2017’s best music coming from one city, one may wonder what’s going on over there to fuel this creative drive? I’m still figuring that one out.</p>\n<p>For many, 2017 was also soundtracked by the breathtaking new series of Twin Peaks, featuring a wealth of new music, both new and old. Many were surprised to hear that Lynch himself produced most of the sound design, featuring noisy industrial remixes of Beethoven, Penderecki and er, Lenny Kravitz. The style of this new series featured a new act to perform at the Roadhouse venue at the end of each episode, like a kind of American chat show format. Despite the questionable appearance of Hudson Mohawke, there were also guest appearances from indie dream pop bands and even Alex Zhang Hungtai (better known as Dirty Beaches), whose new 'Love Theme' project produced some of the most stirring dark-ambient of the year. Anyone looking for some other great ambient this year should find Jasmine Guffond’s <em>Traced</em> and PAN’s <em>Mono No Aware</em> compilation.</p>\n<p>Imprints like Horo and Hidden Hawaii continued to revitalise, and offer fresh perspectives on the techno/drum and bass crossover. DB1's <em>Zwischenwelt</em> or 'in between worlds' was a notable highlight, as the title might suggest occupying a space between D&amp;B and dub techno with deft ability. The release is one of great depth and warmth, intricate 160bpm+ rhythms blushed with rich ambience and delicate sound design.</p>\n<p>Then there have been labels like Haunter, ICM Records and Conditional showing how divergent approaches to running a label ‘DIY style’ can be. Alongside tees, zippo lighters and at one point convincing me they'd begun selling football scarves as well, Haunter have unleashed a slew of deadly percussive abstractions. In April they put out Petit Singe's ‘Akash Ganga’, an explosive combination of ruptured breakbeats and sampled references to her birthplace, Bengala, following this with John T Gast’s <em>Inna Babylon</em>, an astral exploration into downtempo electronica. For ICM or ‘In Context Music’, 2017 was a year of resurgence, reopening their run of lathe cut 7”s with a fascinating series of electroacoustic oddities.</p>\n<p>One trend that was overlooked in 2017 was the growing microcosm of interest in what I dub ‘neo-minimalism’. There were two releases on Conditional in this vein: Sebastian Camen’s <em>Tan Object</em> and Richard’s <em>Pocket Protection</em>, as well as six quickfire digital releases from tuuun’s nascent FLUF imprint. These releases focus heavily on the soundwaves themselves, and little else. Listening to these tracks is like putting a synthesiser under the microscope, to watch its ‘inner life’. The result is a difficult but ultimately rewarding move away from the oversaturated, ‘reverb-drenched’ electronics that were once so in vogue.</p>\n<p>EVOL provided an exemplary of this at FASMA and Norberg Festival this year, soundtracking a crazed-technicolour light show with jarringly clean frenetic square-wave modulations. Another label treading similar water is of course SM-LL, who this year released a new Typeface EP for every month in the year. The idea was, in true minimalist style, to constrain one’s creative process to this one simple rule: leave everything unwritten until the month itself had arrived. Like an experimental music soap opera, I was hooked from the first instalment.</p>\n<p>The fate of other imprints has been less happy. In a difficult to disentangle piece of PR-y obfuscation, Raster-Notion divided the label in two for reasons which aren't entirely clear, other than due to the administrative difficulties of running a label across cities. It was a shock to see the split of an entity which has been running for 18+ years. The announcement was especially bizarre given the release of ‘Source Book 1’ earlier this year; a modular book designed so that it would be possible to &quot;update the content in due time&quot;, suggesting the label's separation may have been decided rather abruptly. Olaf Bender continues adding to the catalog of Raster Media, while Carsten Nicolai helms Noton, so in many ways all is not lost. However, it does feel like the end of an era to lose an imprint which wielded such authority in the world of minimal electronics, and also one which had worked hard to become more inclusive, freeing itself of some of the stereotypes which surround academic-leaning musical scenes.</p>\n<p>2017 has been another year of political turbulence, social degradation and economic turmoil. This doesn’t look set to change anytime soon. But if you’re looking for a source of momentary escapism, the music mentioned above may be helpful in some way. Optimism can seem foolhardy, London’s community can feel like a forgotten dream, and the financial prospects of musicians and artists at large seem to get bleaker by the month. Yet once again we find ourselves overwhelmed by the endless streams of dynamic and inventive new music from all around.</p>\n<p>These days it sometimes feels like each person flicking through records in a store or queueing to have their wristband fitted at a festival has their own place in the scene, by virtue of making music themselves, running a night, blog or related project. Rather than rolling our eyes in that “everyone’s a pundit” kind of way, it's worth considering the transformative effects this widespread involvement can have, and is already having in the world of electronic music. We are seeing a democratisation of DIY labels, bolstered by the support of DIY festivals, blogs, radio shows and more.</p>\n<p>So while we’re doubtful 2018 is going to get any easier, we can take comfort in the fact localised scenes appear to be coalescing again. This is an odd twist of fate given a few years ago we would have argued the effect of the Internet was leading to the exact opposite. What else is there to say?

Earlier this year, he released his first solo album under the pseudonym 'An Gella', entitled <em>Perma</em>.</p>\n<p>The LP is a stunningly unrestricted amalgamation of different tonalities; fragmented and then reassembled with true craftsmanship. There's not many releases you'll find Spanish guitar noodlings, choral ambience and a glitched out abstraction of the 'before the drop' sample from 'RIP Groove' all within a few tracks of one another.</p>\n<p>On paper it all sounds rather chaotic, yet Zidore has managed to piece together a beautifully interwoven release which plays out like the soundtrack to a dystopian sci-fi. Indeed, it recently accompanied me on a late-night wander through London's favourite financial toy town, Canary Wharf, and I can think of no better accompaniment to the imposing glass towers and deserted streets than Zidore's eery synthetic experiments and warped instrumentation.</p>\n<p>So now you have some background, I guess you're probably wondering what er, the inside of Zidore's brain looks like?

The Edited team hosted three very different events over the year around South East London, including their debut in an abandoned Deptford police station, audio-visual performances and live-coding. Their ethos is one of audience participation and collaboration, through multidisciplinary performances and platforming of lesser-known artists.</p>\n<p>Next week, Edited Arts are hosting 'Futureshock' at London's New River Studios. The name 'futureshock' is borrowed from Alvin Toffler, who defined it as the psychological state of individuals and societies exposed to what he called ‘too much change in too short a period of time'. The evening thus aims to explore these futurist ideas surrounding the psychology of acceleration and emergent technologies. They write, &quot;at Futureshock we will consider how much is too much and explore the current boundaries between humans and technology. By creating an immersive multi-sensory experience we hope to question the effects of constant multiple digital stimuli in our daily lives.&quot;</p>\n<p>There will be performances from Shiva Feshareki, Shelley Parker and Typeface as well as many others.</p>\n<p>Find full details of the event can be found <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/139818850068591/\">here</a>.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Feditedarts%2Fvideos%2F943440462497265%2F&show_text=0&width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"296\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allowFullScreen=\"true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>When the parents of Robert Earl Davis Junior, aka DJ Screw, bought him his first decks at the age of 10 it was the beginning of a journey which would see him go from local treasure to almost mythic status. &quot;Whenever you want to find Screw, just go in his room and he'll be on the turntables&quot; his brother Charles Davis once commented on his teenage years. 'Chopped and screwed', the style which he pioneered, saw Screw slowing down hip-hop records to sluggish speeds, perfectly matching the laid-back, codeine sipping lifestyle of the Houston hip-hop scene at the time. Today you will find Screw's influence reach from the likes of Frank Ocean, Drake, T-Pain and A$AP Rocky, to The Knife, Clouddead, Balam Acab and Oneohtrix Point Never.</p>\n<p>Screw was born in Smithville, Texas, moving according to his parents' work. They settled in Houston; a city with which he would become inextricable. Rumours abound when it comes to DJ Screw, from homespun truths to the more flagrant. Some say his moniker was born of how he would scratch records he disliked with a screw, while others say the name came from the fact Houston crews began using screws to adjust boomboxes to play mixtapes slower. Screw also trained as a pianist, and some have gone so far as to suggest he could play Chopin compositions by ear.</p>\n<p>As his popularity grew, Screw became a founding member of Screwed Up Click, attracting local rappers who would freestyle over his dense, funked-out recasts of classics by Tupac and Dr Dre. Perhaps the most striking thing about his tapes was that many were custom made according to the wants of different fans, with people travelling from around Houston to deliver tracklists to Screw's house which he would in turn mix for them. His former girlfriend Nicole Williams recalled how his popularity grew to the point where Screw had to put a gate at the end of his property, enforcing opening hours so he wouldn't be stuck selling tapes all day. This interest ultimately grew to the point where Screw opened his own store, Screwed Up Records and Tapes, which still exists today.</p>\n<p>Screw died of an overdose of codeine and other drugs at his home studio in 2000, aged just 29. Many of his friends have lamented the portrayal of this in the media, speaking of a man with a big heart, whose boundless work ethic played as much of a role in his passing as substance abuse. It has been alleged one of Screw's tapes sold over 50,000 copies, and the number he produced is nearly always estimated at over 1,000. Aside from the importance of his sound, the tale of the chopped and screwed scene is also one of a community banding together, selling tapes door-to-door, outside the influence of major labels.</p>\n<p>Considering the number of tapes Screw produced across his lifetime, it seems somewhat ineffectual to try and commemorate his influence with just two or three tapes,  but here are a few of our favourites.</p>\n<p>###1 Bigtyme Vol. II: All Screwed Up (1995)</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2QHUKoPpof4?rel=0&controls=0&showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" gesture=\"media\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>In 1995, when <em>All Screwed Up</em> was released, Screw had become something of a legendary figure for aspiring rappers, producers and DJs in Houston. The chopped and screwed style, which Screw had almost singlehandedly pioneered, had come to dominate Houston’s neighbourhoods on both Screw’s native south side and the rival north side, and had begun to make a nationwide impact too.</p>\n<p><em>All Screwed Up</em> was one of Screw’s few mixtapes distributed via a label – Houston’s Bigtyme Records – rather than self-released, although stylistically it is hard to discern much difference from those self-released tapes (see <em>Codeine Fiend</em> below). Containing tracks from only a handful of artists, all from Texas, like many of Screw’s releases it includes an introduction from the man himself, in which he warns that “these haters ain’t gonna like this”. If they didn't, it would have been their loss, as <em>All Screwed Up</em> showcases Screw at the height of his powers and evidences his many talents – as a selector, remixer, and turntablist.</p>\n<p>The mixtape’s highpoint comes as Screw drops The Art of Noise’s haunting synthpop classic (and proto-dubstep roller) ‘Moments in Love’ into the mix alongside UGK’s ‘Something Good’. Screw takes the UGK original, built around a simple sample from The Isley Brothers' carefree ‘Summer Breeze’, and brews up something exquisite and narcotic, stripping away layers of the track’s bravado and extracting its sedative and plaintive undertones.</p>\n<p>It takes boldness to develop and perfect a technique in a manner as idiosyncratic as Screw did, and this confidence manifested itself both in his willingness to dismantle and repurpose the music he enjoyed, and in his inspired selections drawn from beyond the confines of Southern rap.</p>\n<p>###2 Don't Make Dollars Don't Make Sense (1995)</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CRY-ik0rKfw?controls=0&showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" gesture=\"media\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>This tape stuck with me for the fact it begins by turning Tupac's 'Dear Mama' into something like a drunken late night answer machine message, complete with slurred proclamations of adoration from the mothers of Screwed Up Click, before scratching out the original. Screw's love of all things Tupac is no secret, and this tape makes a good example: near enough every couple of tracks is sandwiched with something by the West Coast rapper. Screw's taste was more diverse than some give him credit for; you can find tracks by Miles Davis and even Phil Collins in some of his other tapes. <em>Don't Make Dollars Don't Make Sense</em> is a great example of a straight hip-hop, R&amp;B and g-funk tracked Screw mix however, turning his masterful scratching skills to everything from A Tribe Called Quest and 2 Live Crew to Aaliyah and Mary J. Blige.</p>\n<p>Reportedly, this was a personalised tape for Screwed Up Click member Lil' Keke, gifted by Screw. Keke was a close friend of Screw, gaining recognition for his '97 track 'Southside' and receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award from Barack Obama in 2016 for his community service efforts in Houston.</p>\n<p>###3 Codeine Fiend (1995)</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2eE3yZ8QYTY?rel=0&controls=0&showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" gesture=\"media\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>Much has been written about Screw’s music capturing something of the experience of a codeine induced stupor; although the centrality of codeine to Screw’s music and to the Houston scene has arguably been overstated, with marijuana playing an equally important role in the development of the music. Whatever the substance of choice, Houston rapper Mike D, who appears on <em>Codeine Fiend</em>, claimed that the states the two drugs induce are “everything” to the chopped and screwed sound. Screw took an ostensibly playful and trivial behaviour – messing with the pitch control on a turntable, something any adolescent with a pair of decks will have done – and persisted with it to create something transformative. On Screw's tapes lyrics are drawn into sharper focus by being slowed down – a necessary aid to comprehension in the catatonic state brought on by heavy sizzup, weed, and alcohol consumption – and their narrative is foregrounded. Not only this, but is as if syrup has been poured into the turntables, clogging up the mechanical parts, a sonic equivalent to the experience of walking underwater, heavy limbs meeting gloopy, aqueous resistance.</p>\n<p>Unlike <em>All Screwed Up</em>, on <em>Codeine Fiend</em>, the 49th release in Screw’s self-released ‘Screwtape’ series (which continues to be added to posthumously), Screw draws on gangsta rap and hip-hop from across the US, including West Coast rappers such as Eazy-E (the second side opens with Screw paying tribute to the recently deceased NWA member), Tupac and C-Bo, alongside East Siders Biggie and Slick Rick, with even the Midwest represented by Da Brat (of Joliet, Illinois). The mixtape’s fantastic opening, however, sees Screw keeping it local, as he takes 4 Deep’s already languid ‘Rollin 4 Deep’ (another Houston track based on an Isley Brothers sample) and decelerates it until it feels like a lysergic daydream, albeit one replete with a healthy dose of chopping and scratching. Listening to tracks like this today, one can discern the wider influence the chopped and screwed style would have on experimental hip-hop in the Clouddead or Anticon Records mould.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Elias Johansson</em></p>\n<p>The titles and artwork that accompany Lotic’s music have a definitive ‘physical’ quality to them. The covers for 2015’s ground-breaking <em>Agitations</em> and <em>Heterocetera</em> show contorted bone-like structures, like the deformed skeletons of animals poisoned by radioactive waste. Track titles like ‘Amygdala Hijack’ and ‘Fractures’ and even Lotic’s own alias (meaning 'situated in rapidly moving fresh water') tell a similar story. One of an organism trapped in an unusual or difficult environment. I can think of no better metaphor for describing Lotic’s music. Their work often deals with the difficulty in surviving a hostile world, and the near-insurmountable task of creating an environment that is friendly to you. “Being queer or a person of colour in the West”, they once wrote, “you're always on the outside looking in.” This is likely never truer than in Lotic’s hometown: Houston, Texas.</p>\n<p>The new environment that became home for Lotic was the Janus community and their legendary parties in Berlin. When the Janus parties first started, it was one of the first times I had seen people dancing to experimental sounds in a big way. When I first started clubbing, the music they played in most London clubs was straight – both as ‘hetero’ and as ‘linear’. The queerness of the original Loft parties had, I assumed, been permanently co-opted. Queer clubs were doomed to continue playing the same old disco classics; mainstream clubs would remain decidedly unqueer. It's fair to say that my vision of the future of club music was bleak: a tech-house kick stomping in a straight club, forever.</p>\n<p>But the Janus parties are a ride. Famous for their high-octane dynamic shifts and dramatic sound effects, they became the arena from which Lotic’s sound flourished. The use of sound effects in Lotic’s music is of particular interest to me. There’s often an argument made that popular culture is a big part of how we index gender stereotypes and gender roles. This is why TV, film and adverts are often the focus of feminist writing. Lotic, and the music that surrounds them, make a lot of referential cues, wrenching sounds from their original context and replacing them in a DJ set or track. During a Lotic set, you can hear broken glass, horror movie screams and an R&amp;B vocal hook in the space of five seconds. In what is perhaps the apotheosis of recontextualised sampling, Lotic soundtracked 2016's nightmarish presidential election with a self-released re-work of Beyoncé’s ‘Formation’, dubbed ‘<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/lotic/formation\">ELECTION ANXIETY/AMERICA IS OVER EDIT</a>’.</p>\n<p>Their latest project, <em>Embryogenesis</em>, explores “the restrictions of assigning certain dance genres to specific racial groups or cultures”. The piece is a collaborative work with American ballet dancer Roderick George, setting classical dance styles to Lotic’s explosive club workouts. The piece investigates the potential to dissolve boundaries between ‘high art’ and ‘popular culture’; between ostentation and banality; between the mental and the physical. The show is  part of the impressive schedule at this year’s CTM festival, in Lotic’s new hometown. In anticipation of these performances, and with news of another album on the horizon, we caught up with Lotic to talk biology, sex clubs and the meaning of life in their first interview in over two years.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/232845896&color=%230c0c14&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>You started 2017 by tweeting that your New Years’ resolution was simply to ‘not die’. What do you have planned for 2018?</strong></p>\n<p>[Laughs] Yeah, I made it! It was one of the worst years for me and was pretty bad for a lot of the people closest to me, too. So I think this year will be a lot of mainly trying to get back some kind of stability. I think everyone is just trying to reclaim their time [laughs].</p>\n<p><strong>You must be keen to get this new album released!</strong></p>\n<p>I’m excited beyond belief to get this album released. I kind of forgot in the last two years how much time and effort it actually takes to make it happen (partially because of my impossibly high standards), but I'm honestly so proud of the work that I'm more than willing to do what's required to get it all juuust right. Can't wait!</p>\n<p><strong>What can you tell us about this new record?</strong></p>\n<p>I can say that it's definitely a bit of a reaction to the wildness of the world. I spent the last two years really trying to get to the essence of who I was as a musician, in a sense. But also trying to make sense of the purpose or place of the musician. So serious, I know [laughs]. But this will be my 17th year as a musician! I'm a sax player turned theory student turned singer turned electroacoustic musician turned DJ-producer turned composer.</p>\n<p>I obviously started Lotic as a DJ-producer project but I felt it was important for a debut album to somehow try to represent my entire musical history in a way that was more obvious than anything else I've done. At the same time, the world felt like it was so quickly shifting towards fascism in a way that made being a musician feel completely useless, especially after doing <em>Agitations</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>What has changed in your approach to music since <em>Agitations</em>?</strong></p>\n<p>I was already pretty upset about what I was seeing and experiencing so I had to ask myself why I was making this album, or any music at all. I had to, like, stand outside of myself, and put myself in a position to make something that I maybe would've wanted to hear as a young black gay kid in Houston in this kind of landscape. I had to remember how hopeless you can feel in times like these and deliver some kind of strength and hope. I had to shut everything out except for violins and harpsichords and, like, Beyoncé in order to really deal with all of this [laughs].</p>\n<p><strong>I was intrigued to read that you have been listening to chamber music recently.</strong></p>\n<p>My life became very 'write, listen to chamber music, write, twerk, write, read, write'. <em>Lots</em> of meditative walks. I had to let go of my own anger, or re-direct it, in order to 1) continue for myself 2) continue for the sake of my career. <em>And then</em> I lost my flat early last year and wasn't making money and became super depressed and abused alcohol and entered a rocky relationship and was just generally over everything! So the album kind of became my own salve. I ended up needing it more than I was initially expecting. It became the only constant in my life. It became my lifeline.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4614/38875779684_217500e356_h.jpg\" alt=\"lotic\">\n<em>Photo by Elias Johansson</em></p>\n<p><strong>I’ve never had the good fortune of seeing you play live so I am super excited about coming to Berlin at the end of the month for CTM. The festival’s theme this year is ‘Turmoil’ with the tagline 'uneasy times calls for uneasy music'. Do you consider your music to be ‘uneasy’?</strong></p>\n<p>I honestly never thought of my music as uneasy [laughs]. At least, not besides the moments during a DJ set where it's deliberate. But over the years I've heard it many times. At university when I was studying and making electroacoustic music, I remember never following the brief because I just wanted to use my voice for everything. Like, yeah this song made of field recordings of rocks is cool but my voice is already right here! Or even just the pressure to play jazz as a saxophonist. I guess I kinda always stood out but I never really realised that I maybe made people &quot;uneasy&quot; until I started getting press. Everything's exaggerated, of course, but when your work is just the ideas you have privately, naturally, and you see “LOTIC IS DISRUPTING CLUB MUSIC” it kinda makes you stop for a second. I milked it as fuck, though. My fault.</p>\n<p><strong>My immediate thought is that there are probably few ‘easy times’ for a queer person of colour.</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, of course people will naturally revolt in shitty times. And, yes, a part of me will always have to revolt every single day. But that's my burden! And I'm learning to carry it gracefully. But that's what [Embryogenesis] is about, the balance of trying to live daily life in a country that's not as diverse as the one you're from, where navigating queerness is foreign to you. How do you balance being annoyed by ignorant questions and obnoxious staring that cut at your humanity with being a loud, proud, fierce-ass, beautiful-ass bitch? It's a daily dance, and this piece is a very small way for us to both let off some steam and to attempt to answer that question.</p>\n<p><strong>I guess that links to your alias and a lot of the artwork that comes with your music. For me, they seem to always show an organism in some awkward environment. Are you interested in nature?</strong></p>\n<p>That's interesting that you picked up on that. I definitely always kind of wanted to be a biologist. Before I finally accepted that I was a musician, that's what I wanted to be. I didn't realize it was so obvious [laughs]. Slightly embarrassed… But yeah, I always want to work with sounds that are at least a little organic-sounding, even if they're all kind of highly distorted and made to feel metallic. Part of it is of course my training, but part of it is also again that escapist mindset I had in the suburbs of hot-ass Houston. I always fantasised about living in the mountains by a river because it was the literal opposite of cars and sweltering concrete highways and strip malls and food chains. Hell, I still fantasise about that cabin [laughs]. Me and my boyfriend talk about it a lot. I'ma need high speed internet, though.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4755/38688582965_ce97fc1aba_h.jpg\" alt=\"lotic2\"></p>\n<p><strong>The Janus parties were the first time I heard experimental, or queer sounds on the dancefloor. How do you think this change came about? Did the queerness bring the experimentation or did the experimentation allow for the queerness?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, thank you! You can't take the queer out of the queer, hunnie! Honestly, I never liked the 'experimental' thing. None of us were really experimenting any more than any other artist normally does. I guess so many people are so comfortable working in an established genre, but for us that was never really going to be fulfilling. We weren't getting bookings. The people we wanted to see DJing in Berlin were not being invited to Berlin. We had to transform an old sex club into a night club [laughs]. It just felt necessary, so we forced it. We're definitely all grateful that anything substantive came of it (shoutout to Berghain!) or even that people regularly came then and still come. But people caring or understanding was definitely secondary to our needs.</p>\n<p><strong>I guess I have also noticed a recent turn in queer spaces towards more experimental sounds. Is this a new trend or has there always been an undercurrent of queer experimentalism that has simply been ignored in recent years?</strong></p>\n<p>It's always kind of hard to say. Venues have a lot to do with this, right? Like I said, we basically <em>made</em> a club because nobody wanted to hear glass breaking at 130bpm in Berlin in 2012. I think the political environment has a lot to do with this too; the economy. Sometimes the financial stakes are just higher; a club just needs to stay open. Other times, the emotional stakes are higher, so people go out just to <em>feel</em> and they're totally down to be served whatever you have on the menu.</p>\n<p><strong>Is it true you were a shy child?   </strong></p>\n<p>Oh my god I was so shy! Up until like 4 or 5 years ago, to be honest. So, I'm definitely still an introvert. I always say I'm a 'social introvert' [laughs]. Like, I love being around people, but only when I want to be around people. But growing up, yeah, music was basically all I felt I had. The shyness definitely just came from never feeling like anyone wanted to hear what I had to say. I was an 'Oreo' to the black community, and the gay community has a lot of fucking work to do with internalised shit with regards to femininity. And racism, to be honest. Plus I was <em>weird</em> [laughs]. Even within my musical experiences.</p>\n<p><strong>So the music was precious to you back then too?</strong></p>\n<p>Of course. I've always mixed R&amp;B and New Orleans bounce and black women anthems into my sets because those things really informed and freed me. Those were always the things that made me feel good in a world that doesn't want me to. Everything I’ve ever done pays homage to these musics, including Embryogenesis and this new album.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you consider yourself an optimist?</strong></p>\n<p>It's kind of crazy, but I was always very defeatist and pessimistic before moving here. That's a big reason I made the move: I didn't want that for myself. Who would? Now, I would say I'm maybe a realist? Happy and excited about the future but not quite yet on the optimistic side, just because I have a pretty good understanding of history and human behaviour [laughs]. But I’ve been generally happy since being here, and I never thought happiness was, like, a state of being or an outlook. I always thought it was just a temporary emotion people <em>sometimes</em> feel. Isn't that crazy? Isn't that a crazy fucking existence? But that's just what it's like for so many artists in America, for people in general. Add in darker skin or queerness, and it does kinda feel like &quot;what's the point?&quot; No venues, no money, lots of “no&quot;s.</p>\n<p>So, for me, it was leaving the environment that made me feel so bad. And I am well aware that this isn't an option for 99% of the population of the planet. I almost didn't go through with it. I was sick and depressed for a year when I did. But I just knew I had to try because there was nothing waiting for me at 'home'. That said, the grass is greener, but she's still malnourished. I happen to have my dream job, but I'm not in any way immune to or free from the things that factored most into my move. They've just been suppressed. If anything, I struggle a bit with guilt because of the privilege I've had to create my bubble. But don't cry me a river!</p>\n<p><strong> What do you do to stay hopeful? </strong></p>\n<p>I've learned to really focus on the things that make me feel good, rather than the things that upset me. To be honest and loud about when I'm not feeling good. I've learned to ask for help, which is a work in progress [laughs]. I've learned to ask friends to sit with me and cry when I need that. I've learned to take frequent walks, to write things down, to <em>really</em> take moments to re-centre, to meditate really, I guess. I've also really learned <em>how</em> to listen. To disagree without having to fight or have your day ruined, without letting it upset you. To empathise. Empathy definitely doesn't come naturally to me, but it has become one of my main priorities.</p>\n<p>Also, I watch a <em>lot</em> of comedy. Crying and laughing are such similar emotions, and I'd definitely rather laugh. And to be honest, comedians have perfected the game! A good comic will point to all the ways life is trash but will also remind you of the scale of human existence. It's funny to be told by a stranger that your tweet about pasta or your selfie at a Holocaust memorial is shitty because it's able to re-contextualise our lives. A joke about debt can ease your fears about checking your mail or answering the phone. Comedy is a subtle reminder that the Earth is billions of years old and that the small shit really doesn't matter but also that your pain is real and that you're not alone. Comedy will always be one of the best reminders that we ain't shit [laughs]. But in the most beautiful way! We ain't shit, but that's also OK. We don't have to be. None of us asked to be here. Life is kind of absurd! But it's beautiful.</p>\n<p>I know this all sounds a bit like 'Becca who shops exclusively at Whole Foods and is kinda vegan and just discovered yoga and collard greens, which she refers to as kale', but it all <em>really</em> helps. You have to somehow be able to place yourself above what's ailing you. Self-care is real.</p>\n<p><em>Catch Lotic's new show, <a href=\"http://www.ctm-festival.de/festival-2018/artists/k-o/lotic/\">Embryogenesis</a>, at CTM festival next month.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/188017096&color=%23454545&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>If there was one album that I wish I had covered in 2017, it would be Jasmine Guffond’s <em>Traced</em>. I first heard the album about five months late, at the end of last year. I hadn't noticed Guffond’s name or music orbiting around the blogosphere anywhere. This surprised me not just because it is a brilliant record, but because I had been avidly anticipating the follow up to her 2015 debut, <em>Yellow Bell</em>. I realise now that this was down to my cultural lag, since there were indeed reviews on Boomkat and the Guardian at the time. So... sorry about that.</p>\n<p>Guffond’s music has an interesting lineage in that much of it comes out of research, both in the arts and in science. Much of her work focuses on the process of ‘sonification’, making sound out of that which is not. She developed apps that sonify GPS networks and invented the ‘sound selfie’: generating an audio signature from facial recognition software. Much of Guffond’s interest also lies in the darker applications of digital technology. State surveillance, Internet privacy and the loss of identity in the digital age are central themes.</p>\n<p>On <em>Yellow Bell</em>, Guffond presented these concepts in a way that was close in resemblance to an art exhibition or the research findings of an experiment. Somewhere between ‘soundscapes’ and musique concrete. Waves of soft static ebb and flow, punctuated by odd samples, the sources of which remain unknown. There are very few moments of conventional ‘musicality’ to speak of, with the notable exception of Guffond’s solitary singing on tracks like ‘Elephant’. It shouldn’t work as an approach but it really does.</p>\n<p>If ‘Yellow Bell’ was an opening statement, then <em>Traced</em> is its conclusion. The voices on this album sound more like secret recordings, made unbeknownst to Guffond and sent back to her in pieces by an ominous other. On ‘Post-Human’, her voice splinters across the stereo-field. On ‘GPS Dreaming’ it is stretched out of shape like pizza dough. <em>Traced</em> is also markedly more paranoid in mood. You can almost feel the icy net of surveillance drawing tighter. Anyone living in London, CCTV capital of the world, will know the feeling. But there is also surge of confidence on this sophomore. Guffond has honed her craft into an artform and the album flows with definitive purpose towards its conclusion.</p>\n<p>In the latest addition to our mix series, Guffond weaves together some of the influences on her new record, from Ligeti to Gabor Lazar. Listen below. You can also read more about her work in our full-length interview with Guffond from 2015 <a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/interviews/the-algorithmic-gaze\">here</a>.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&light=1&feed=%2Fstraylandings%2F0083-jasmine-guffond%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>\n<br>\n### Tracklist\n<p>ES - Ennen Oli Huonominn <br>\nMeredith Monk - Panda Chant II <br>\nEvol - Untitled 03 (Melting Pinkness) <br>\nRashad Becker - Traditional Music of Notional Species Vol. 1 (Themes 1) <br>\nCatarina Barbieri - Scratches on the Readable Surface <br>\nDemdike Stare - Caged in Stammheim <br>\nGyörgy Ligeti - Glissandi <br>\nGiacinto Scelsi - Trio á Cordes - 3éme mouvement <br>\nRon Morelli - Shredder <br>\nMark Fell &amp; Gábor Lázár - Neurobiology of Moral Decision Making (Tk 1) <br>\nTony Conrad - Four Violins (1964) [Edit #1] <br>\nBiblo - Oh God (forthcoming on C Sides) <br>\nJasmine Guffond - Boundless Informant <br></p>\n",

This simplification of his setup coincided with the release of <em>Barricades</em> late last year, an album referencing Vigroux's belief that we are increasingly retreating into the comforts of technology, rather than pursuing organic interactions. The LP is an assertive and visceral offering, as if attempting to wake the listener from their technology induced stupor and get out in the fresh air.</p>\n<p>If you’d rather stay in a darkened room in front of your laptop with a cup of Horlicks however, Vigroux has offered us a premiere of the video which accompanies the title track, created by Kurt d'Haeseleer:</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aVIX0G7g9MA?rel=0&controls=0&showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Ambient music and techno have long been odd bed-fellows. On the surface, they are almost polar opposites in style. The former is beatless and artsy, designed for contemplation 'in the head'. The latter contains little more than percussion, designed for moving the body. But actually, techno artists have long been incorporating ambient into their music. The style itself has its origins in the 'chill out' rooms of clubs for exasperated ravers. And when techno began getting big, moving away from underground 12&quot; cuts and towards the industry standard of full-length albums, producers used ambient 'breathers' to help break up the onslaught of drums. Both ambient and techno also share a kind of functionalism. If ambient is 'furniture music' to decorate a surrounding, then techno is the music of foundations, the ground on which all else is built. They both aim to facilitate in some way: be that for day dreaming or night raving. Techno for the build up of tension, ambient for its dissipation.</p>\n<p>Manni Dee is best known for his brutal bass-heavy techno sets, best heard within a sweat-drenched club at 6am. But there is a more vulnerable, inward-looking side to his music, under the 'Nuances' moniker. The Nuances project takes as its focus the minutiae of sound. Beauty creeps in at the most secret of places: the tape hiss, vinyl pops and warped samples inherent within a decaying medium. In this sense, Nuances is part of a lineage in 'hauntological music', a style deeply connected to memory, nostalgia and dystopia in contemporary culture. Artists working in Hauntology (Burial, The Caretaker, William Basinski) commit to a kind of political pessimism: atomism can only accelerate, isolation can only intensify, and things can only get worse. The Nuances soundscapes project Manni Dee's fears of the present and impressions of the past into music that has that uncanny feeling, as if implanting an unpleasant memory you did not have before.</p>\n<p>But the latest Nuances release is markedly less bleak. One might even argue that this is a collection of love songs. The track names themselves seem to suggest it at least, leaving clues to a lover, 'someone to struggle with', and washing off the dirt of loneliness. But more than this, Nuances has brightened the colour of his sound. This time round, Nuances sounds more confident, more optimistic. The album closes in a sudden cut of sound, as if someone had pulled the plug. But this does not suggest an ending so much as an intermission. There is more to the Nuances story yet to come.</p>\n<p>'Murmurs of a Heavy Heart' is out January 29th on Tabernacle Records.

The record presents two 20-minute pieces that work more like 'sound sculptures' than songs. They take as their subject the detritus of sound, the unwanted buzzes and resonances of technology. On <em>Political Ritual</em>, these sounds move out of the corners and rubbish bins and into plain sight. You are made to confront sound as it really is: caked in surface noise and sonic debris.</p>\n<p><em>Political Ritual</em> is a record of two halves. The first, 'Cérémonie', judders like a truck over bumpy terrain. There are moments of what sounds like hyper-engineered studio-production trickery. But in fact, many of these are from acoustic sources, like cellos and organs played in unorthodox styles. There is even the introduction of &quot;a wedding harmonium bought from an old man in an Indian village&quot;.</p>\n<p>The unanswered questions left by 'Cérémonie' are concluded by the record's second half: 'Projection Cathodique'. Here, elements of traditional 'musicality' creep in, like the bassline that broods over the piece. The 'politics' of <em>Political Ritual</em> remain somewhat unclear, but its ambiguity is addictive.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2401154825/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://actuellecd.bandcamp.com/album/political-ritual\">Political Ritual by Political Ritual</a></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>The churn of the electronic music business can seem endless at times. Every day we we are flooded with more and more releases, yet taking any one year past at random, we would find a lifetimes worth of innovative music to sift through. Jakub Mikołajczyk of Monotype Records and Aleksandra Grünholz, the musician behind We Will Fail recently began a new venture which swims against the tide somewhat.</p>\n<p>The pair's &quot;slow label&quot;, Refined Recordings, has been two years in the making, seeing its first release out this week. 'Schadenfreude' is a four track EP comprised of two originals from Grünholz, backed with remixes from Irish technoise favourite Eomac, and Planet Mu's Ziúr. The duo intend to continue taking the label game at their own pace, giving each release the time and attention it deserves, rather than rushing to get wax in stores.</p>\n<p>Previous work from the Warsaw-based Grünholz has pursued fractured sound design and coarse, off-kilter rhythms sitting somewhere between techno and the outsider-dance realms of acts like Kyoka or Senking. There is something more affront about this latest work however. 'Night' for example, blasts forth with obstinate intensity, devilish arpeggios penetrated by thunderous static oscillations, and trap-indebted percussive manoeuvres.</p>\n<p>With the recent release of 'Schadenfreude', and a further EP on the horizon including more original work from Grünholz backed by remixes with Peder Mannerfelt, Kangding Ray and M.E.S.H, we decided to catch with her to discuss the new label, her work as a graphic designer and baroque visions of hell...</p>\n<p><strong>I wanted to start off by asking how Refined Recordings came to be - I saw you and Jakub had another project called Refined Pleasures a few years ago... Was this a bit of a precursor to the label?</strong></p>\n<p>Refined Pleasures was a project me and Jakub started working on two years ago or so. But we had the concept from the beginning to start a label. We were just thinking about a name one day, and 'refined' was the best way to describe what we wanted to do...</p>\n<p>We have also been making music together from the beginning, but are waiting to do something with that at a later stage. Even before Refined Pleasures we worked together on different stuff.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/249323812&color=%238a8a8a&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>The label is defined as a 'slow label' - how would you best explain what this means practically?</strong></p>\n<p>Preparing to get to the stage we are at now took around two years. We didn't want to go too fast, we wanted to be able to give a lot of attention to all our releases. We wanted to focus on quality, and take the time to make sure everything was as it should be.</p>\n<p>Jakub runs Monotype Records, and he was sometimes releasing ten or twenty records a year. He was frustrated, because he couldn't give proper attention to each release. You make so many things, but you can't focus on them or give them proper attention. We wanted to do things slowly this time, working with just one or two titles at a time. We plan to make four releases a year at the most.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think it’s a bit like being a shepherd; you can guide the sheep a bit one way or another, but they’re living organisms and can do what they want at the end of the day!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>I guess you can get into bad habits where you feel a need to release as much or more releases than you did the year previously...</strong></p>\n<p>You have that kind of pressure but I don't think it's necessary in our times, especially because there's so many releases coming out every day. Are you up to date with everything? It's impossible. Even if there was no more new music made, there's probably enough already! We could listen and still be amazed by sounds and find something new just from past material. We tried to take a step back and produce less, with more time to have fun with what we do.</p>\n<p><strong>I was interested in your <em>Verstörung</em> LPs, in which you've approach the same materials twice, in effect giving an update as the tracks have been altered through live renditions. With 'digital music' it often feels like things are never finished - it's tempting to keep revisiting things.</strong></p>\n<p>It's funny because I often do that with tracks. I don't release them a second time, but for my live shows I often do reworks. Like you said, when the track is finished and you've listened to it loads of times you start thinking: &quot;hmm, let's try it a different way&quot;. Why not!</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/131822020&color=%238a8a8a&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>The first two Refined Recordings EPs are a couple of your original tracks backed by remixes. How did you go about selecting people for the EPs? They're quite varied in some ways.</strong></p>\n<p>We were searching for experimental remixers, but they all have their own unique style. The first criteria was to find people whose music we love - I'm a fan of each of them.</p>\n<p>I asked them not to make typical dance tracks because for me it didn't make any sense as there are already so many good dance tracks out there. I was interested in what they could hear in the tracks I made. I think the effect is really nice and as you say they're really varied. Each track sounds different from each other, and they differ a lot from the originals. I have to admit, sometimes I think they sound even better than the originals!</p>\n<p><strong>It's always nice when you get something back and it's not what you were expecting.</strong></p>\n<p>Exactly, when I heard the Eomac remix I didn't recognise that it was made from one of my tracks. I really really like it!</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/380477393&color=%238a8a8a&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>The Peder Mannerfelt one is really cool too because you can hear the original clearly but he's managed to turn it into that super raw, club type track he has been producing lately.</strong></p>\n<p>It's funny because he also makes lots of experimental stuff like the <em>Controlling Body</em> album, I really admire it. At the same time he can make these kind of aggressive dance tracks. You can tell how the two Peders influence each other...</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4623/25910342138_d37252fb33_b.jpg\" alt=\"q\"></p>\n<p><strong>The visual aspect to the label is all done by you right?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah. Each release will be different, but in this series they are all going to have this same theme of 'the last judgement'. These are all collages and I think they correspond well with modern electronic music.</p>\n<p><strong>They remind me of Heironymus Bosch or someone like that...</strong></p>\n<p>It's made from renaissance pieces of art. I like the connection between music and the visuals. Especially when the two seem like they are from different worlds. The music is modern and the visuals aren't... I was focusing on the last judgement; demons, punishment and hell. It was funny doing the research.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of crazy images out there, but so many of them are similar. It looks like the artists are almost copying each other. It's hard to find a really original vision of hell. There is a canon for this kind of stuff - a lot of demons eating people, they have people in their asses and so on but it repeats in so many variations.</p>\n<p><strong>You designed some of Unsound's 2017 'Flower Power' theme right? I thought it was a great choice for the event, as the greyscale, brutalist carpark aesthetic of so many electronic music festivals has become such a cliche now.</strong></p>\n<p>The curators said the same thing - they were tired of everything being dark, sad and grey. We were searching for something crazy and colourful to add a lot of energy. We felt it reflected the event more as it should be a fun experience - the saddest moment of Unsound should be when you have to go home!</p>\n<p><strong>I noticed flowers (or botanical explosions as I've read you put it) crop up quite a lot in your artwork, and even press shots. How does this relate to the music behind We Will Fail and do you have an interest in botany more generally?</strong></p>\n<p>I really like these kind of botanical images and I think it's similar to the renaissance images we mentioned before. Do you know the phrase 'horror vacui' from the baroque-era? It means to be afraid of emptiness. In baroque there were so many motifs and every space was filled; I really like these structures where you have this thickness to the image. Flowers and botanical images worked well with this kind of idea - adding lots of life to the image. I think that's why I was using it a lot. I like the intensity of having so much colour, and so much life.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pBrAoxQmXZk?rel=0&controls=0&showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>Are you working with field recordings much these days? What do you look for in found-sounds?</strong></p>\n<p>I started my adventures in music by working with samples so it's a familiar space. I was doing some workshops and found it very interesting. I bought by first recorder about ten years ago and was recording a lot then, gathering sounds from the environments and cities. People ask me a lot about field recordings, but for two or three years I haven't done it very much. I've been using synthesisers more and focusing on working with samples. It's a tool that's good to use when it's right, but it's not everything.</p>\n<p><strong>How long have you had the studio you're in now for?</strong></p>\n<p>We started to develop it a couple of years ago. I started with a computer and the sound recorder and that was all the equipment I had. It's a different way of working now I have some synthesisers and so on. I think the biggest problem is finding time. As I am getting older I have less and less time. Having a studio and working there is really nice because you can experiment a lot and learn a lot. There is a space for music aside from your living space.</p>\n<p>That said, I often still work just with the computer, in my bedroom or something. When you have an idea and can access the computer you can realise it quickly. If you always have to go to the studio and plug in everything... It's a different way of working.</p>\n<p><strong>You mentioned in another interview not wanting to be reliant on visuals at live shows, and I've also read you're a big Autechre fan... How do you feel about the lights out policy they follow when playing live?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes I am! I really like their live shows. The music is so rich and has such a wide spectrum of everything, it means you don't need anything accompanying the sound. In their case it works well.</p>\n<p>In my own, I'm still thinking about it. I might say I don't like visuals, but there are so many artists who are doing it really well. I think there is a right way to do it. You have to do it smartly; it's good when the two aspects correspond.</p>\n<p><strong>You put quite a lot of effort into the artwork which accompanies your music, so it would almost make sense in your case to link them at live shows.</strong></p>\n<p>I like the connection between illustrative images which look like they're from a fairytale or something, contrasted with modern sounding music. I'm not really sure about doing it live during a concert. It's something I'm working on right now; connecting the two for the live shows. I'm developing ideas about how connect them as I don't know if complex sounds and complex images work well together. They may end up fighting against each other, so I have to work out what is more important and what gives a stronger narrative.</p>\n<p>Right now I'm thinking of having the whole live set in the dark, and just having images show up at key moments. When you don't have everything all the time it's dosed a bit better. It can emphasise or change the sound for a moment.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you find it stressful working on graphic design as your day job and also needing to do that work for your music?</strong></p>\n<p>It's funny and sad at the same time because everything is work in some ways! Working on my own projects is the most pleasant part though. Stress... I don't know. I was stressed before the covers came from the print house for the latest EP. Regarding design though; I know what I want to achieve so it's not stressful for me. It's just a pleasure. I have such little time but this little part of my life; making music and running the label, I just want to enjoy it and have fun.</p>\n<p>It's another aspect of the slow-label idea. Everything around us is moving so fast, I don't want to be stressed with another thing. I just want to do things I love. It's funny though because you don't have control even with running a label. So many things happen that you can't avoid. I think it's a bit like being a shepherd; you can guide the sheep a bit one way or another, but they're living organisms and can do what they want at the end of the day!</p>\n<p><em>Keep up to speed with Refined Productions over at their <a href=\"https://refinedproductions.bandcamp.com/\">Bandcamp</a>.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/417292010&color=%238a8a8a&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>In 1975, the University of Buffalo hosted a performance of John Cage’s ‘Song Books’, a collection of Cage’s experiments in musical notation, facilitated by Morton Feldman and with Cage present in the audience. These ‘songs’ are notated in wild experimental style, from standard notation to Cage’s special brand of dots and lines to merely text highlighted in different sizes and fonts. Some of these pieces with more abstract notation give only a simple instruction, like &quot;perform a disciplined action&quot; or “give a lecture”. One performer, Julius Eastman, performed Cage’s instruction to give a lecture, inviting a young man on stage to undress him and make sexual gestures. Cage was furious with the performance, explaining that the instructions are not intended to allow the performer to “do whatever you want”, adding that Eastman's &quot;[ego]... is closed in on homosexuality. And we know this because he has no other ideas.&quot;</p>\n<p>Cage was both right and wrong. It’s true that Eastman’s sexuality was central to his work. In the late 70s, New York’s burgeoning gay scene became a welcome home to Eastman (well, before he was evicted for falling behind on rent). In the Lower East Side, Eastman made historic connections, becoming the first male vocalist in Meredith Monk’s ensemble and conducting the orchestras for Arthur Russell’s instrumentals. In this sense, Eastman had a unique experience in that he came from both the academic minimalism of upstate New York, and the swinging hedonism of downtown Manhattan. But what Cage failed to see was the sprawling, searching mind of Eastman. His music is ‘out-there’, even for modern ears. And he takes minimalist ideas further, and into more dangerous territory, than Cage, Glass and Reich were willing to go. Even in his rendition of Cage’s songbook, Eastman attempted to disrupt the perceived acceptability of so-called avant-garde experimentalism, holding the radical aims of the project to its word.</p>\n<p>Yet, Eastman died homeless in 1990 with little of his music remembered or celebrated. Even his obituary did not appear until eight months after his death. There have since been many attempts to revive an interest in Eastman, led by hardcore fans and the people who knew him. One such attempt at a revival is happening at this year’s CTM festival, which opens with a memorial dinner to Eastman and restaging two pieces for piano (‘Gay Guerilla’ and ‘Evil Nigger’) in new arrangements, interspersed with short theatrical vignettes on Eastman’s life and music. In anticipation of this performance, we look back at Eastman’s musical back catalogue and discuss three of his most important works.</p>\n<p>###Femenine (1974)</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"20\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/273605791&color=%23949494&inverse=false&auto_play=false&show_user=true\"></iframe>\n<p>Very little material of Eastman's still survives. There are almost no recorded performances and almost all of his scores were swept into the trash when he was made homeless. This adds to his mystique as a tragic and unknowable hero. But part of the recent resurgence of interest in Eastman is down to a re-release of <em>Femenine</em> on Finald’s ‘Frozen Reeds’ imprint last year. This recording was special in that it was one of the few high-fidelity recordings that remain of Eastman’s own performances. Here, you can listen to the unusual form of conducting that Eastman employed. The piece opens with a mechanical device designed to shake sleigh bells, a move now regarded as a jibe at the mechanical nature of Glass &amp; Reich (a music devoid of the groove and feel of jazz). You can even hear the audience laugh as it is switched on. Each performer also uses a digital clock as a temporal guide to piece. The accompanying score instructed performers to modulate their playing at certain minute-marks. Although seemingly mechanical in its approach, the performance is anything but. Eastman even said of it that, “the end sounds like the angels opening up heaven”. But despite this spiritualism, Eastman’s sense of humour is never far away. In this 1974 performance, Eastman insisted on serving soup to audience members.</p>\n<p>###Evil Nigger (1979)</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"20\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/106067556&color=%23949494&inverse=false&auto_play=false&show_user=true\"></iframe>\n<p>Eastman experienced a lot of unease from his audience for the use of the n-word in his ‘Nigger Series’ titles: Nigger Faggot, Crazy Nigger and Evil Nigger. He remarked on this that “the reason I use that word is that for me, it has a basicness about it [...] the first niggers were of course ‘field niggers’, and upon that is the basis of the American economic system. Without field niggers, you would not have such a great and grand economy [...] so a nigger for me is that kind of thing which pertains himself or herself to the ground of anything.” The ‘basicness’ of Eastman’s music is felt in a piece like <em>Evil Nigger</em>, arguably his most emotionally raw composition. In a popular 1979 recording, the trills of piano are punctuated by Eastman’s own voice, shouting ‘one, two, three, four!’ to conduct a brooding refrain that sounds more like the dramatic climax of a Baroque requiem, music that Eastman learned and loved. But where the narrative arc of Western classical music follows the structure of crisis &amp; resolution, <em>Evil Nigger</em> is all crisis.</p>\n<p>###Gay Guerilla (1980)</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"20\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/225698585&color=%23949494&inverse=false&auto_play=false&show_user=true\"></iframe>\n<p>One of Eastman’s most famous inversions of the minimalist tradition came through what he termed ‘the organic principle’ of performance. This is a cumulative technique in which new sections overlap with preceding motifs to create a dense lattice of musical expression. He once described the method, explaining (somewhat unhelpfully) that, “the information is taken out at a gradual and logical rate”. At points, it sounds like musical contradiction: a rhizomatic hodge-podge of paradoxical melodies. In ‘Gay Guerilla’, the pianos rise like Shepard tones into an ecstatic fanfare. At its peak, the piece merges into a cacophonous canon of the Lutherean hymn, ‘A Mighty Fortress Is Our God’. It has since been dubbed a 'manifesto’ for its ecclesiastical grandour and emotional power. In language typical to the ambiguity of Eastman’s thought, he once said of its title, “without blood there is no cause. I use 'Gay Guerrilla' in hopes that I might be one, if called up to be one.&quot;</p>\n<p>Catch a performance of ‘Evil Nigger’ and ‘Gay Guerrilla’ as part of the opening concert for this year’s CTM festival.

    "content": "<blockquote>\n<p>“Mika [Vainio] was not only a friend and collaborator, but also an inspiration for my work as an artist. This is a celebration of his contribution to our work.” - Carsten Nicolai, aka Alva Noto.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In September 2002, three luminaries of the electronic music scene came together at the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art in Newcastle, for a collaborative performance that would be lost to the halls of time for near 16 years. It re-emerged in recorded form just this month, sadly with Mika Vainio no longer with us, having tragically passed away last year aged just 53. Given this context, the release takes on a new meaning, paying tribute to the Finnish artist’s staggering legacy; one which saw him collaborate with everyone from Björk to Alan Vega, and even face legal action from Japanese tech giant Panasonic for the name of his collaboration with Ilpo Väisänen and Sami Salo. For this reason, it was renamed – and became best known as – Pan Sonic.</p>\n<p>The timing of the release is fitting in more ways than one however. It also comes following the separation of Raster-Noton. Having diverged into Raster Media and NOTON last year due to the difficulties of running a label from different corners of the world, <em>Live 2002</em> makes a bold mission statement for the newly independent NOTON.</p>\n<p>It is also an invitation to consider the alignments and divergences of the three artists, offering a listen which is in many ways typical of all of them, yet hard to imagine them constructing individually. Across the 11 ‘movements’, you will find Noto’s characteristically deft static polyrhythms, the laboratory precision of Ikeda’s <em>Test Pattern</em> LP, and the deeply meditative alternative ambience of much of Mika Vainio’s offerings on Sähkö, in abundance.</p>\n<p>This is music wired directly from the mainframe; grinding electronics building to insurmountable pressure. A marching anthem for the technological generation if you will, and both a stunning tribute and timely reminder of Vainio’s legacy from two who knew him closely.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/368412137&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>There’s a received wisdom that visual elements of music production (the artwork, light shows and fashion) are merely auxiliary. Music should be appreciated in an almost Platonic way: wrenched from context and understood in terms of sound only. After all, why should your listening be coloured by a dazzling light-show or a flashy press shot?</p>\n<p>Indeed, there are some artists who have tried to negate this by 'anonymising' themselves. Zomby, Burial, Klaus are famous for it. There are degrees of consistency here, from the near-entire invisibility of Klaus to the pseudo-disguise of Zomby. With Zomby, the anonymity <em>is</em> the look. He is always half-hidden behind a coat or a mask, but dressed in designer clothes. His press-shots both hide his identity and confirm it. Even the man who conceals himself nonetheless reveals himself as a self-concealer.</p>\n<p>There are also musicians who use visual components as a way of making sound. IDM artists have been using spectrograms to encode secret messages for decades, and last year, Jasmine Guffond released an album of ‘sonified’ data from GPS signals and facial recognition software. Even Daphne Oram ruptured this audio-visual dualism with her famous ‘Oramics’ machine.</p>\n<p>Then there is the visualisation of sound. A common cliché of modern music production is its visual bias. These days, producers use laptop screens to <em>see</em> how something <em>sounds</em>. As a consequence, we are alienated from sound. The language of production — soundscape, aural decor, furniture music, sonic sculpture — must always make recourse to the visual.</p>\n<p>In the 20th century, many avant-garde composers attempted to liberate music from the conventions of visual representation. John Cage, György Ligeti, Krzysztof Penderecki, Karlheinz Stockhausen and Iannis Xenakis all wrote ‘graphic scores’ that attempted to disrupt the orthodoxy of classical notation. Staves, clefs and crochets were bent out of shape into psychedelic configurations. Beyond pitch and rhythm, this radical new notation captured all aspects of sound including timbre, space and emotion.</p>\n<p>Finally, there is the strange but consistent flirtation of fascist imagery in techno and industrial music specifically. In trying to shock their audience out of their dogmatic slumbers, Throbbing Gristle appropriated the ‘flash in the pan’ logo of the British Fascist Union and projected footage from Auschwitz at their live shows. More recently, revivals in gabber have made similar gestures, such as Gabber Eleganza’s fashy-looking flag-waving on stage. Their intention, I think, is meant to be understood as ironic. But the irony is lost when your audience comprises a demographic of white skinheads.  In this episode of Stray Landings FM, we speak to Robin Buckley and Alice Bettinger about all this and more.

    "content": "<p>Cross Fade Enter Tainment (CFET) are scheduled to release a remastered version of Christoph de Babalon's <em>If You're Into It, I'm Out of It</em>. This edition, limited to only 300 copies and mastered by Rashad Becker, will mark 21 years since its initial release. In 1997, club music had reached an interesting juncture. The optimism of early rave had given way to a darker outlook. The smiley face of acid had morphed into a evil grin, and the melodic riffs and vocal hooks became displaced by yet more percussion and digital processing.</p>\n<p>This turn to the darkside produced some of electronic music's most striking and heavy contributions. Digital Hardcore Recordings (DHR) were instrumental here, incorporating almost all aspects of 'extreme' music (punk, gabber, noise) into one glorious monstrosity. These releases have a bleak trajectory to them, as if written to accelerate the deterioration of social fabric. Take Atari Teenage Riot's anarchic manifesto: <em>Burn, Berlin, Burn</em>, also released in 1997. This was music from the tail-end of Generation X: bitter and violent, its aims were the abolition of all culture and the creation of none. A self-destructive rush into a hot furnace of overdrive.</p>\n<p>Christoph de Babalon joined this scene through this release on DHR. Its high contrast artwork and ironic title capture of the mood of the time. On the one hand, it is cold and maths-y, like the Neo-Noir psychologism of Aronofsky's <em>Pi</em> or Lynch's <em>Eraserhead</em>. But it is also carries a certain swagger, an adolescent anti-everything nihilism. Thom Yorke even described the record as “the most menacing album I own”.</p>\n<p>It's often said that while most genres develop as hybrids of two or more styles, jungle is more like a mutant. Tech-house or dub-techno are clear in their lineage, a cherry-picked composite of two distinct styles. But jungle, born out of techno and hip-hop and yet nothing like either of them, is a different beast. In 1992, Derrick May warned of this impending new genre as, &quot;a diabolical mutation, a Frankenstein's monster that's out of control&quot;.</p>\n<p>If jungle is a mutant, then Christoph de Babalon's music is a mutant's mutant. <em>If You're Into It, I'm Out of It</em> is both hardcore and ambient at the same time, a combo Philip Sherburne described as &quot;a hellishly compelling couple&quot;. Just listen to the epic 15-minute opener, '<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jFmwI_LCAQ\">Opium</a>', a track that predates the gothic ambience of artists like Demdike Stare. In fact, I dare say that DS directly lifted its chords, style and sound for their 2010 track, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK8w6t9JC4Q\">'Matilda's Dream'</a>...! But then there are explosive breakbeat experiments, like 'Water' and 'My Confession' that lash out like rabid Rottweilers. Too weird for a rave but too rave-y for the home, <em>If You're Into It, I'm Out of It</em> exists in a netherworld that is still not understood.</p>\n<p><em>If You're Into It, I'm Out of It</em> is available now from <a href=\"https://boomkat.com/products/if-you-re-into-it-i-m-out-of-it-2018-remaster\">Boomkat</a>.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/326258431&color=%238c8c8c&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>The latest release on Where to Now? reminds me of that scene in the Wallace and Gromit film <em>The Wrong Trousers</em> where Wallace finds himself laying the track ahead of the model train he’s riding one piece at a time, so as not to be derailed. ‘Spoils’ is a series of violent dislocations; dance tropes subverted by wild electroacoustic falterings and squealing percussive outbursts. Written by Cambridge native Joe Higgins, aka Metrist, the release is an exercise in dancefloor turbulence. You’re never sure what’s around the corner, but it’s a hell of a ride.</p>\n<p>Truth be told, we’ve been writing about Joe’s music longer than I care to remember. His first release came about when he was just 17, subverting the post-Blawan diaspora of dubsteppers turning their hand to techno with a pair of violently warped acid-excursions. Since then he has meandered through the most brooding extremities of bass-heavy dance music, releasing twisted low-end abstractions on the likes of Fifth Wall and Opal Tapes. On the other hand, his contribution to the Neighbourhood series is rife with frolicking Radio Boy-style sample tomfoolery.</p>\n<p>Knowing what to expect from each new forthcoming Metrist record can be difficult. But it’s perhaps unsurprising he has continued to explore new possibilities with each record. Joe recently completed a degree in digital music and sound arts at the University of Brighton, an experience which introduced new and unexpected influences to his production. Until last year he was also putting on nights in Brighton, under the name Zallogut.</p>\n<p>With ‘Spoils’ due for release next week, we decided to catch up with Joe to talk about the record, concréte heads, and how he’s been influenced by Mr. Oizo…</p>\n<p><strong>You started producing with a bit of a D&amp;B background right? How do you approach those records compared to the slower techno stuff you’re doing now?</strong></p>\n<p>I think the mixing style is so different; you’re mixing to drops. It’s quite rare you’ll have two tracks going at the same time for a while, which is pretty common in all that ‘arthouse techno’. I think I still have that in mind. That’s why UK and broken stuff feels way more fun to mix still. If I’m mixing something Livity or even Gqom, for example, it’s much more fun to work out where ‘drops’ are and so on.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The whole gunfinger thing was something I'd been ignoring for so long - it felt time for a revisit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>The other thing with that D&amp;B scene is that they have very specific rules – your intro has to be a certain length etcetera…</strong></p>\n<p>I think those rules are so ingrained in me – I honestly find it really hard to escape that! I had the yips with a 4/4 kick drum, do you know what I mean? Like in golf…</p>\n<p>I would literally do a four-to-the-floor kick drum and everything sounded awful. I think this was when I started doing all the broken beat stuff as L.SAE. I would make something with a 4/4 kick drum and then just take it apart. That track on Timedance was originally 4/4 but then it got cut up and done because I felt it didn’t have enough space. I think I’ve managed to find more space in my tunes recently.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/218582813&color=%238a8a8a&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>It's funny talking about these strict production rules because this new EP, especially 'An Soaep', feels designed specifically to confuse DJs...</strong></p>\n<p>I think honestly it’s just because I get bored. Over the years I think I’ve lost a lot of pretence, but also gained a lot of pretence. But I realise I’m not trying to make some kind of big room track for a club in Leipzig… That just isn’t me.</p>\n<p>It’s a concept EP really, but it’s a lot more tongue in cheek. I feel like it’s more my speaking voice. It’s not me trying to do something someone else would do. We have some shout outs on the back of the sleeve… ‘An Soaep’, with that big snare was me doing a kind of play on big beat – Basement Jaxx and all that kind of stuff. Then ‘On Golden Seize’ was like El-B and Groove Chronicles… To be fair it was more Mr. Oizo!</p>\n<p>It felt more me being like ‘what would it sound like me trying to do Mr. Oizo?’ I guess it was me being real to the fact that I do steal a lot. Not in the sense that I just rip a track and reverse it, but I take a lot from what other people are doing and I think I was being quite dishonest with that in the past and trying to hide it. This EP is me clearly doing that style.</p>\n<p>‘Pantomimer Tongue’ was me doing the Brighton techno stuff. [Cristian] Vogel and [Neil] Landstrumm. Big clunky tuned kicks, but with that huge synth in the middle. The last one was a tribute mostly to do with Meredith Monk, neo-dada and Fluxus.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/389002809&color=%238a8a8a&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>That's quite a range from Mr. Oizo to neo-dada... It makes you sound a bit cracked to be honest mate.</strong></p>\n<p>[Laughs] Well if it does then I’m pulling the interview. I think that EP was fun and I’d like to get into that mindset again. In the Mr. Oizo one there’s a lot of stuff taken from the way that Luc Ferrari and [Bernard] Parmegiani, these old Concréte heads… I don’t think they’ve ever been described as ‘heads’ before! [Laughs] The old masters of pure sound meeting a fucking garage beat… That made me crack up man. Doing that kind of stuff that would make you gunfinger, versus really meticulously produced stuff.</p>\n<p>That juxtaposition I found so hilarious. Especially with ‘On Golden Seize’ and ‘Pantomimer Tongue’ which took ages to make, there was this kind of like ‘give a fuck’ feel to it. I’d been trying way too hard previously.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4754/39942669572_a686a4abe9_b.jpg\" alt=\"qw\"></p>\n<p><strong>That is one of the funny things with the electronic music scene today. There's a constant meeting of these academic scenes and party music.</strong></p>\n<p>I was talking to Omar – Batu – the other day. I’ve just done a track for a compilation he’s doing. He has quite a big say in what goes on in what you’re making. It brings up this conversation of whether the label owner should really be telling you what to do. I think they should. I think you should come to them with a slightly unfinished project and they should know what’s good and what’s bad.</p>\n<p>He really helped me get the best out of this track. It’s a dance track and he was like “this bit’s cool, but could you boost the levels on this bit because that’s what’s going to make the gunfingers come out and that’s why we’re all here”. I just felt like, that’s so true – that’s why I’m in this. To make stuff like when you first heard ‘The Nine’ by Bad Company and you pull a face. I would like that feeling to happen with something I’ve made. The whole gunfinger thing was something I’d been ignoring for so long, it felt time for a revisit.</p>\n<p><strong>It gets disguised a bit I guess. People want to make tracks considered high-art but it's club music at the end of the day.</strong></p>\n<p>You’re making music for people on drugs and I think in the ’90s they knew that. I think clubbing today is less about taking a pinger and losing yourself for six hours. I think maybe it’s lost a little bit of fun along the way… I don’t want to be that guy that says we’ve lost the fun from clubbing because it’s still there but there’s more pressure on clubbing now.</p>\n<p>With Zallogut we had to create and brand and we found it really difficult; it felt really toxic. I remember the first time I set up a meeting about Zallogut; I thought we were going to do well whoever we booked because the club’s Patterns and people go to Patterns… But it’s not Tresor or Berghain. The clubs used to be an institution; they were the brand. Now the onus is on the promoter to deliver.</p>\n<p>I think running nights in Brighton took years off my life because I wouldn’t know how the night would go until half an hour into it. We’d spent all this money on line-ups and the worst feeling in the world is when you have someone who’s travelled miles and had a rough day on public transport to play in front of not as many people as they thought they would. Having to tell them that is difficult especially when you know that feeling yourself.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/341333935&color=%238a8a8a&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>You've stopped doing the Zallogut nights now?</strong></p>\n<p>I stopped doing them last year after the Matrixxman and Batu night. I was in my third year of university and found it too much, although I don’t regret any of university.</p>\n<p>The guy who used to fund us (I didn’t have £4,000 for bookings), he’s moved on from Patterns. He used to trust me with the Zallogut nights because he wanted something with a little bit more edge in Brighton. It didn’t work a lot of the time; we did this party with Objekt and Dasha Rush and we spent maybe five grand and only took three grand back… I just can’t afford to do that on my own.</p>\n<p><strong>The course was the sound art course at the University of Brighton right?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah – I didn’t want to do a music production course because I felt like I’d already taught myself how to use DAWs and stuff on my own. It was something that I’d already done. The course in Brighton opened me up to a lot of sound art… I don’t really like the term because it’s very academic. It’s very highbrow and annoying but I really got into it.</p>\n<p>I was studying under a guy called Milo Taylor who now works at LCC [London College of Communication]. He really got it because he came from a jungle background but was now doing sound art. He was this bridge to that world that previously I’d thought was just really academic dudes with beards…</p>\n<p>Milo was really involved with the fact we were doing Zallogut and he used to listen to my music and get back to me on it. He was really important in giving me some confidence in that world that felt so far away. I think a lot of people find that term artist… I am wearing a turtleneck but… [laughs] The turtleneck wearing, paint-splattered alcoholic. I’ve always known that I come from this small village in Cambridgeshire and whenever I go back I always get rinsed for whatever I’m doing. I always felt like I needed to do an ode to that. Bands like the Kinks or Cleaners from Venus used to sing about little England and this kind of thing. I got inspired by that but didn’t know how to voice it in my own stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>Talking about growing up in small town England - those European football stickers on the back of the record really reminded me of that time in my own life.</strong></p>\n<p>I think the art for that came from the frustration I have that I’ve lost a lot of knowledge over the years; names, places, dates. Things like that. But I could tell you who scored the fastest goal in the Champions League ten years ago, or I could tell you who transferred from Atletico Madrid to Inter Milan for £32m…</p>\n<p>The record sticker itself are these forgotten(ish) football players - Roy Makaay and Dennis Rommedahl. Me and James from Where to Now? talked about loads of these players and it was like they live on in my memory. For me there is this hilarious mystery around retired footballers. Some of them are working as taxi drivers now and so on. Ian Dowie for example is a property surveyor and he used to play for West Ham… We put these players on a pedestal where it’s almost magical when you see them in the wild. I thought I’d can that for this record. I’m glad you had that reaction to it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4712/39992838531_fedbedc599_b.jpg\" alt=\"a\"></p>\n<p><strong>On the subject of Cambridge I wanted to ask what your first clubbing experiences were like...</strong></p>\n<p>The first time I went to a club I had a fake ID and I was 15. I went to see Flux Pavilion at the Fez. I remember loads of the other kids my age didn’t care but I really cared. It’s not something I’m really proud of that I was into Flux Pavilion but after that we started going to these D&amp;B nights called Warning.</p>\n<p>It’s the oldest D&amp;B night in the world if I’m not mistaken. It’s older than me. It happens once every two or three months. I went when I was 16 or 17 and it was sometimes really terrifying. I don’t know how the fuck they would let me in at 16, I looked about 11. Fights used to just break out, such was the vibe. Everyone was really into the music but there was lots of posturing. I remember once throwing up in a urinal and being ridiculed by all these rudeboys that were in there.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/284758239&color=%238a8a8a&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I remember finding those parties genuinely quite scary at times.</strong></p>\n<p>I remember going to one and seeing a 70 year old man in a grey suit and tie going off to some some gabbertech nonsense and thinking that it was just the bleakest thing I’d ever seen. That should have been enough for me looking back - I should have put down the USBs and resigned from dance music then [Laughs]. I should have started a ukelele company or something after. That was really sobering.</p>\n<p><strong>Talking about early clubbing experiences - I listened to your very first release the Nineteen89 thing recently - you would only have been 17 or 18. What was it like getting bookings in clubs at that kind of age?</strong></p>\n<p>I had never done the whole resident thing which I think was to my detriment. When I first started getting bookings I was playing at really good times. I was jumping into these student nights in Nottingham and so on. I think it kind of skewed my mentality, thinking that I could just play what I want. Some people have learnt their trade from years and years of learning what the club’s like and what the trajectory of a night is. It was a bit much starting off.</p>\n<p>I remember just riding off that first release for ages. Then the Fifth Wall thing came out and it was much more serious and much more angry. That’s when the anger started to come out I think; I had a lot more anger in my music then. It was a bit of a muddied anger that I couldn’t vocalise. I don’t think I vocalised it very well in the music even – not that I was really in a bad place, but it was a good way of getting stuff out. I got off on making stuff harder and angrier and that was fun. I think now I’ve lost a lot of that. I’m not as angry…</p>\n<p>I’m still really happy with that body of work but I don’t think I could make that again because I’m not that person anymore. I guess it seems like I’m bouncing around a lot but that’s just my thing, you know! It’d be cool to have this discography of perfectly planned out releases but that’s not how it worked out, so fuck it.</p>\n<p><em>'Spoils' is available on <a href=\"thttps://wheretonow.bandcamp.com/album/spoils\">Where To Now?</a> from the 5th of February.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/378131753&color=%238a8a8a&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\"></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p>My first encounter Daniel M Karlsson came  through his release on <a href=\"http://shop.conditional.club/album/expanding-and-overwriting\">Conditional</a> last year, <em>Expanding &amp; Overwriting</em>. This is an explosive album, bursting with dazzling pyrotechnics of sound design. Karlsson's music is part of a lineage of new music made with code. Many contemporary producers, in an act of anarchistic reclaiming of technology, have disposed of hardware, VSTs and plug-ins to get at the very building-blocks of computer processing.</p>\n<p>I first saw 'live-coding' in Tokyo in 2014, at the 'Beyond Code' evening with Yu Miyashita and Akihiro Kubota in SuperDeluxe. When I returned, it seemed to be everywhere. It's an exciting new format for electronic music in that it attempts to demolish the stereotype of laptop-producers. The argument has long been that performing live on a laptop takes away everything that is interesting about live music. There is really no 'performance' to speak of and the source of the sounds are blocked (literally) by the back of a laptop screen. For all the audience knows, the producers might as well be playing songs off iTunes and checking emails. Sometimes they probably were.</p>\n<p>But live-coding reverses this. By presenting the audience with the raw code as it is being played, we are given a novel way to understand the sound, following the thought process of the performer in the moment and across the screen. This democratising effect has also spawned coding workshops, such as in London's very own Music Hackspace. Coding therefore has an inherently demystifying and inclusive political bent, in contrast to the closed producer-hierarchy of standard laptop sets.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;...music in general, and popular music in particular, is like a virus...&quot; — Daniel M Karlsson</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When I ask Karlsson how 2017 was for him, he immediately taps into what the coding-community seems to be about. &quot;I feel I've had a good year because I learned loads about writing code, making music and configuring my computer. I've felt tremendously inspired this year by making new friends who also write code, make music and spend a lot of time configuring their computers.&quot;</p>\n<p>This latest mix he has done for us comes with an instruction manual, written by Karlsson. &quot;This kind of thing can be done on any OS&quot;, he begins. &quot;You most likely already have a Terminal of some kind already installed on your computer. I use a Terminal Swiss-army-knife style music program called <a href=\"http://sox.sourceforge.net/\">SoX</a>. It is free. I used two instances, because as you know, a DJ has two decks and mixes between them. The thing that lets me have two instances of SoX with that look and feel is called <a href=\"https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki\">Tmux</a>, which is also free. The commands I use to screw the tracks in this particular way that I like can be seen in the video.&quot;</p>\n<p>The actual music in this mix is not what I was expecting. The majority of 'coding' sets sound disappointingly uniform. Anyone who has not been to one of these shows should expect lots of erratic, highly-compressed percussive pops and repetitive loops whilst we wait for the performer to enter code for the next phase. But this live set is slightly different, taking the format of a standard DJ set but presented in code, like watching the computational map of a VirtualDJ set. &quot;I am very into the idea of doing DJing in this way in the future&quot;, Karlsson expands. &quot;I would love to DJ at a wedding or something like that where this way of doing it would be extra super weird. Fingers crossed you know.&quot;</p>\n<p>The sounds themselves are also fucked with in a 'chopped &amp; screwed' kind of way. This style of sample-processing typically lowers the tempo down into a murky tranquillising effect. Karlsson, in an attempt to protect his identity, also uses this processing on his voice during interviews. &quot;Swedish state radio and television news shows used to transpose voices down and sprinkle with ring-modulation to protect the identities of certain people like whistleblowers or just people caught in bad scenes when I was a kid&quot;, he goes on. &quot;It really made a lasting impression on me. Privacy is a growing concern these days. I think a lot about how the future might turn out for people who generate a lot of very personal data like voice recordings and pictures of their face today. Screwing stuff like this is meant to be playful but also maybe a little sinister. It's really fascinating to me how the mood can change so much by altering a voice in this simple way. There is a lot of very strong potential for subtext there, for me at least&quot;. Karlsson also told me that he has never heard the pre-processed originals of some of the tracks in this setlist: &quot;I just downloaded them and immediately screwed them.&quot;</p>\n<p>This anti-pop sentiment, turning that which is sweet and pure into shit, brings to mind the 'excremental Marxism' of people like Georges Bataille. For Bataille, capitalism turns everything into shit, voiding it of all value through creative destruction. For revolution to occur, we must accelerate the process to finally be rid of our rotting culture. I believe Karlsson is influenced by these ideas, albeit from another source, <a href=\"http://www.erikbunger.com/\">Erik Bünger</a>. &quot;Do you remember that scene in The Matrix where a Smith says he feels as though he's being infected by the stench of humans? It's like that but for popular music for me&quot;, Karlsson explains. &quot;At the core of what has always fascinated me about Bünger's work is the idea that music in general, and popular music in particular, is like a virus. These catchy tunes are cleverly designed to get us to buy in to a life of conformity&quot;. He continues, &quot;I grew up watching way too much <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danielmkarlsson/status/917658670464299009\">MTV</a>. It fucked me up to the degree that I often daydream about deleting that part of my memory. I don't want to be able to sing along to those tracks. I read a lot of Bünger's intentions in his musical works as variations on the idea of performing a kind of exorcism on this uninvited guest which plagues the mind in the form of reflexively nostalgic recollections of sugary pop goo.&quot;</p>\n<p>But for Karlsson, this is also an opportunity for reinvention, for which he thanks Stockholm imprint, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dromfakulteten4ever/\">Drömfakulteten</a>. &quot;They've been tremendously inspiring to me in my metamorphosis. I've changed my way of thinking about the role of the DJ fundamentally. I no longer see DJing as something set in stone which I must adhere to. The role of the DJ and the ritual practice of DJing is entirely in flux. I can address it as my own by thinking of what is idiomatic for where I'm at now working with a computer to organise sounds in new ways. As I've delved deeper into working with algorithmic composition I've become increasingly enchanted by the look and feel of The Terminal. More commonly used contemporary interfaces are incredibly distracting to me and I want out. I've been wanting to create a kind of Terminal equivalent to the ritual of DJing and to use that format to perform a musical exorcism.&quot;</p>\n<p>He also has some very exciting projects for 2018 on the horizon, including music for a Gamelan ensemble and electronics for a split cassette with Mats Erlandsson which will be released this year.

    "content": "<p>The cover of the ‘Protest’ EP, due for release shortly on Eomac’s Eotrax label, features the words ‘resist’ and ‘persist’ ad infinitum. Aside from being the titles to the two original tracks the EP is centred around, its message is one of out-and-out resistance, steamrolling through the darkest excesses of apocalyptic techno. Defiant battle cries, thudding kick drums, gauzy atmospherics and warped sonar transmissions feature in two dense and foreboding warehouse tracks, backed by remixes from former Eotrax signee LAIR and Orphx collaborator Christina Sealey.</p>\n<p>Resistance to what, you might ask? Well, the offering is written by two Berlin residents, Kaltès and Nene Hatun, aka Nene H. Kaltès has been curating the all-female line-ups of the female:pressure parties at Berlin’s Tresor since they began in 2013, which might give some indication of where this aforementioned dissent is directed. The parties have seen Kaltès book everyone from female:pressure founder Electric Indigo to Paula Temple and Adriana Lopez. She is also responsible for <a href=\"http://www.electronicbeats.net/femalepressure-promoter-weighs-female-lineups/\">this fantastic article</a> on Electronic Beats from a few years back, tackling the criticisms of all-female line-ups and highlighting their importance as a political act.</p>\n<p>Nene H., on the other hand, originally grew up in Turkey and studied composition in Ankara, Tel Aviv and Stuttgart. She has delivered everything from bit-washed minimal to circuit board R&amp;B on labels like Seagrave and Salem Rashid’s Bedouin Records.</p>\n<p>With the release due out in the next few weeks, we invited the pair to contribute to our That Time When series and discuss five of their most memorable gigging experiences.</p>\n<p>###Rémy Bricka _ Unknown</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4757/39110860625_f81d03c20f_b.jpg\" alt=\"x\"></p>\n<p>My very first concert was Rémy Bricka. I was three years old. A family member took me there to surprise me as apparently I liked that shit. I remember a crappy venue with lots of children clapping offbeat to Rémy’s performance. ‘Performance’ is the word here as Rémy was known to simultaneously play a drum, a mandolin and a number of special ‘effects’. A few doves were released at the climax of his show, while fireworks exploded.</p>\n<p>The birds were obviously scared but no one seemed to care – not to mention the poor rabbit on his shoulder! I felt so sorry for the animals and so angry at the rest of the world for standing there not doing anything. I threw a tantrum and yelled at him to stop and free the birds. The aunt accompanying me was very embarrassed so she tried to get me out, but I fought hard and became the change I wanted to see in the world… I think I kind of succeeded that time, as I took over the show. I even lost my balloon in the turmoil! I obviously needed to attend that concert, but gosh, that gig was the worst. I hate that gig. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYy3q-qDtO8\">Forever</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Kaltès.</em></p>\n<p>###Tresor with Paula Temple and The Lady Machine _ 2014</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4747/39977027152_8cef38d267_b.jpg\" alt=\"q\"></p>\n<p>One of my all time favourite gig is one I played for female:pressure at Tresor in Berlin in 2014. Paula Temple and The Lady Machine were playing right before me; I was quite nervous. But damn, they both played absolutely killer sets. The Lady Machine has rare technical skills and a great knowledge of music which makes her a monster on the dancefloor. She’s fast, precise and consistent. Very impressive. I can of course say the same about Paula.</p>\n<p>Both these artists – despite their remarkable talent – are profoundly kind, humble, supportive and loving people. So instead of being crushed by such imposing acts to follow, I was totally lifted up and ended up playing a great set too. That night was on fire. Altogether we created something very special. I remember this strong sense of resistance floating in the air; it was palpable. Underground meant something that night. When I have doubts about my work, I just tap into that moment, and I know exactly why I do what I do.</p>\n<p><em>Kaltès.</em></p>\n<p>###Eotrax label night at Säule Berghain, Berlin _ 2018</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4602/39110860195_e758f760d7_b.jpg\" alt=\"a\"></p>\n<p>The last gig I played was at Säule Berghain for the very first Eotrax label night. It was definitely a milestone in my career and a night I’ll remember. It’s always an adventure to release a record, but when you do so surrounded by artists you adore, it becomes absolutely magical. Eomac and Arad (who together as Lakker) happen to be amongst my favourite producers, so of course that was quite meaningful. I’m very happy I could see LAIR’s first live show, it was outstanding. I realised that with techno I perform a sort of catharsis, a purge of emotions, a reset. LAIR’s music works the other way around. It puts you back where you are supposed to be, right at the centre of yourself. It’s a transcendental alignment and a confirmation, should we need one, that music can heal and is a form of love.</p>\n<p><em>Kaltès.</em></p>\n<p>###Mick Harris at Berlin Atonal _ 2017</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4675/39110860485_223e17519c_b.jpg\" alt=\"i\"></p>\n<p>Mick Harris played right before me at Berlin Atonal this summer. I think this was one of the most powerful live sets I’ve ever experienced. Building the richness of the sound layer by layer, alongside the transitions among the architecture of Kraftwerk; it was a masterpiece. I am very picky with live sets and the most fascinating thing for me is when I don’t really know how the artist has done something. That feeling motivates me to push my sound further.</p>\n<p>I was pissed that I couldn’t enjoy it properly, because I was playing right after him and trying to focus at the same time. But that whole Berlin Atonal in 2017 was a very special one. My other favourite from that year was Puce Mary; her music made so much sense.</p>\n<p><em>Nene H.</em></p>\n<p>###Gonjasufi in Stuttgart _ 2012</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4755/39977027382_7aae9e75a6_b.jpg\" alt=\"f\"></p>\n<p>At that time I was still studying classical piano in Stuttgart. Gonjasufi’s music was the kind of thing that I needed; he was proving me wrong on the theory that Turkish music doesn’t have any access in Western countries. He would put out tracks full of Anatolian psychedelia that my ears feel like they were home. I was composing, doing field recordings and had already written some musique concrète pieces back then, but I didn’t quite know how to produce. It made me curious about sampling and inspired me in a way.</p>\n<p>When we saw that he was coming to Stuttgart, we of course bought the tickets. The day comes, we go to the venue. He starts the gig. Me and my friend Tine are already in the front line. Then there is this dude from his crew who stands near me and offers me a toke from the spliff he rolls. Having grown up in Turkey, that offer was probably the second or third time I had smoked weed. I take up the offer and all of a sudden get too stoned; the Eastern influences come in and out; too many emotions; my legs disappear; I am totally paralysed. I had to leave maybe ten minutes after he started, I don’t even know how I got out of there. I waited outside for another friend to come and pick me up. One woman apparently yelled at me for sitting somewhere I wasn’t supposed to sit or something, but I don’t remember that either, the friend who came to pick me up saw this happening. I just remember that I really couldn’t move my legs for very long time. Afterwards Tine told me it was an amazing gig.</p>\n<p><em>Nene H.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/366371879&color=%238a8a8a&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>This month will see the release of Koenraad Ecker’s fourth full-length LP, <em>A Biology of Shadows</em>, on his nascent In Aulis imprint. Ecker’s music exists in a kind of netherworld between jazz and… experimental electronics? Sound design? Noise-art? The music is hard to categorise, not least because terms like ‘sound design’ are vague enough to be void of any meaning. What music isn’t ‘sound design’, exactly?</p>\n<p>Moreover, sound design doesn’t fit the bill as a genre so much as a job. To be a sound designer has sense of the professional attached to it. Alongside the roles of director, editor, and producer, you have the sound designer, whose role is to turn the creaking of doors and patter of rain into spine-tingling effects. Perhaps this is why a lot of sound design music evokes an almost automatic visual narrative. Listening to Ecker’s music, it is hard to resist the rolling of imaginary film in your head.</p>\n<p>Ecker’s work with the Lumisokea outfit has made compartmentalising his music even harder. Every release is forged from a wealth of resources: natural sounds, digital processing and the live recording of acoustic instruments. Ecker himself works with the cello and guitar. This provides a much broader foundation for his work.  There is a sense in which, with Ecker’s music, the dualisms between electro-acoustic, natural-nurtured, organic-inorganic become meaningless. Sound is sound: its source is irrelevant.</p>\n<p>I meet Ecker in the bustling hubbub of Berlin’s Neukölln district. On the street, there is the racket of fruit markets and Reggaeton blasting out of passing cars. But the inside of Ecker’s flat is peaceful and sedate. There is Massive Attack’s <em>Mezzanine</em> and some Kropotkin essays on his coffee table. After a string of evenings at CTM festival, I can, for the first time that week, hear the ringing of tinnitus in my ears. It’s only inside the quiet interiors of Berlin do you realise the cacophony of the outside world. “So,” he begins. “Where do we start?”</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/395250168&color=%23949494&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I didn’t hear any music from you in 2017, which is unusual for you! What have you been up to?</strong></p>\n<p>I was a bit off the radar. It was a year of a lot of changes and I had to work a lot on the side to make rent. I had one big project with Fred [Meulyzer] doing the music for a dance performance in Norway. Aside from that it was very much a year of preparation for me. I was working on Lumisokea’s new 'Dervish' project (a new Lumisokea live project with two percussionists), and on this new album that I am about to release, <em>A Biology of Shadows</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about the album, where did it come from?</strong></p>\n<p>It was a very long process, one that I restarted from scratch three times. I actually started working on it right after <em>Sleepwalkers in a Cold Circus</em>, back in 2015. I finished something of an album then but when I listened back it wasn’t right. I realised that to make this album, I had to collaborate with other people. That’s when I contacted Audrey [Chen] and Alex [Rendall] and the clarinet players Kai, Michael and Chris and I organised a few recording sessions. Then in 2016 I moved to London for a few months because of my wife. I didn’t really know anyone there, so I had the time to work with that material pretty much non-stop at home for five months with headphones trying to create the second version of the album. I finished it by the time I left London. But when I listened back to it with some distance after coming back to Berlin, it wasn’t right.</p>\n<p><strong>In what way was it ‘not right’?</strong></p>\n<p>I had a lot of ideas that I wanted to put into it. And every time I listened, it just wasn’t what I was striving for. Somehow the isolation of London made the album seem strange too… I started revising and revising it but it wasn’t happening – and at that point I basically gave up on the idea of doing the album altogether. But it was like a ghost haunting my brain – after six months, I was still thinking about it. I realised this 'guest' would not leave and that I’d have to deal with it. On January 1st 2017 I began writing it for the third time.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think you work slower than most musicians?</strong></p>\n<p>Maybe yes, at least I have the impression I work much slower on my solo work than on other projects. This album was certainly the slowest process I’ve ever been in, but I’m not sure if it’s for the better? It seems there’s a point at which a constant critical evaluation of your own work becomes immobilising rather than creative. It’s a difficult balance. In my daily practice I feel there is very little correlation between how complex a sound sounds and how complex or laborious it is to make. Sometimes something extremely rich and sensitive can be the result of an accident. Or I can work for two weeks on a sound – recording and re-recording, editing and enhancing – but it still sounds lifeless.</p>\n<p><strong>I guess a lot of the labour you put into music happens prior to the event too.</strong></p>\n<p>Indeed, a lot of it is technique and vision that one develops through years of simply doing it. If I work with a cello or guitar, there are lots of techniques and sounds that I have been developing for years and I are now part of a kind of repertoire, but it took a long time to lead up to that point. The same goes for microphones – I am constantly learning my way around the specific ‘ears’ of different microphones.</p>\n<p><strong>You’re from a jazz background; how much of your sound design output comes from this?</strong></p>\n<p>A major inspiration from having worked in the experimental improv scene is how a lot of people are constantly in search of beautiful, special sounds. For example, one of my best friends, Onno Govaert, is a fantastic drummer in the improv/free jazz scene and a lot of his praxis is also a kind of sound design. He is always looking for a particular bell, a particular skin, a particular way of playing that one sound and refining it and so on. In a lot of his music, it’s no longer strictly about rhythm, there is a lot of very detailed work on the texture of the sounds. I think many free jazz/improv musicians are sound designers without computers. That world was a gateway for me into computerised sound design. It’s a long term goal for me to build interactive processes with the machines and instruments I use. I like setting up processes, and learning to 'play' them as an instrument. This way, I feel like I can make sounds that are way more surprising and dynamic, because what I am doing is less premeditated, and more decisions are taken simultaneously, rather than making music in a step-by-step additive process. I wanted the album to have a looser, more embodied feel.</p>\n<p><strong>Like a kind of ‘naturalistic’ process?</strong></p>\n<p>Maybe 'embodied' would be more accurate… A praxis, a collection of processes and techniques that I can 'practise' and refine and which have the freedom to move into unplanned territory. For me, working with sound is a way of discovering how (in a very non-scientific way), everything is animate. You can go very deep into a sound or you can experience your surroundings in an intimate way through sound. It has happened so often to me that the simple act of consciously listening to the sounds of my everyday environment allow me to discover the extraordinary in the mundane. You realise that objects are not dead, they are alive. Listen to a short sharp snare drum [clicks his fingers] – it was fleeting and you missed it. But you can record it, resynthesise it, stretch it and suddenly it starts speaking: you can hear all of its voices. They were there all along but you miss them because your perception of time is different from that of the snare.</p>\n<p><strong>To me that sounds like a very scientific approach to music.</strong></p>\n<p>Yes in a way it is, like 'uncovering' what is hidden. But in another way I prefer to see it more as a spiritual, non-quantifiable, thing, without the aim of 'controlling' something: using technology to partly unveil the incredibly beautiful world that surrounds us. There is so much music made from things that people never thought could be instruments. In many ways, that’s a defining mark of much of the last 50 or so years of music: making music from things that weren’t meant to be used that way.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/395250165&color=%23949494&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I guess it’s an important lesson we get from structuralism.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah it ties in very well with general structuralist thought where the tools you use to measure, to see, to hear, to talk about things, re-create and define reality – a consensus. It depends on the tools you use and the overarching ideological structure. That makes a huge impact on what you hear and what you don’t. Aside from the ideological, there is also the simple biological need to make some perceptual ‘choices’: for example, if we were in a bar, we would filter out the background noise to be able to hear each other. And as our surroundings become progressively noisier, we become progressively more deaf to a lot of beautiful sounds simply because they are weaker and softer. The metaphor in that is telling I think…</p>\n<p><strong>I read recently that some birds are getting PTSD from the noise of deforestation</strong></p>\n<p>That’s quite shocking, but not surprising unfortunately. I have recently discovered this branch of ecology dedicated to sound; ‘acoustic ecology’. It's about how we can measure changes in biotopes with sound. For example, how a pond or a swamp or a forest changes over 10 years – you listen to how it sounds at different points in time and you build a very clear acoustic picture of how the ecology has changed. For instance, in many places the noise of insects in summer is much quieter now due to pollution. An acoustic analysis allows you to measure certain long-term ecological changes that remain hidden to the eye.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you use many samples from the natural world?</strong></p>\n<p>A lot, yes. And I like working in opposite ways – 'de-naturalising' natural sounds to find the uncanny in them, and making unnatural sounds sound as if they could be found in nature. In a kind of naïve praxis, I like to make kind of 'foley' environments that could be 'real' acoustic scenographies or attempt to do things like replicate bird songs with synthesisers.</p>\n<p><strong>Kind of like Olivier Messiaen I guess?</strong></p>\n<p>Exactly, but Messiaen was much more systematic in this: he was a real ornithologist. He could tell the different bird songs apart, whether they were in mating season and so on. It is fascinating how sometimes I visit a place I’ve never been and hear a bird song that sounds like it could be coming from a feedbacking sherman filter. And vice versa! You can spend days working on a sound, you think it’s really out-there and special and the next day you hear a bird singing it better than any computer could. I would love to one day just try and create the sound of an entire imagined forest using only synthesisers and play it back into the forest. I want to cross those barriers between nature and nurture: the web of life is actually very entangled though our particular world-view tells us everything’s neatly compartmentalised.</p>\n<p><strong>Have you seen the video of the lyrebird replicating the sounds of deforestation and car alarms?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes! It’s really baffling. It’s part of a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjE0Kdfos4Y\">David Attenborough documentary</a> right? I actually saw it in an exhibition in Berlin at the Stoschek collection. I think it was part of a group of works dealing with conception of the 'self' and subjectivity. They were showing it as an example of how animals are capable of adapting to their environments in moments of rapid change, by becoming the environment. It’s a kind of extreme alienation (from our traditional view as a 'self' as autonomous from the environment) through extreme embodiment, paradoxically enough.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s funny how many of those 20th century composers were interested in nature. I remember seeing Penderecki using the veins of a leaf to guide the notation of violin parts.</strong></p>\n<p>That’s true, in the 20th century composer there was a lot of direct referencing to certain natural processes – but also in earlier classical music there are a lot of references to nature, even though they are maybe more poetic, less systematic? I’m definitely not anthropologist but it seems like the majority of music reflects the maker’s environment. The first things people painted were things from their immediate environment (whether visible or not). I don’t even think they saw this art as ‘imitation’, the art and the nature was all part of the same continuum.</p>\n<p><strong>I guess someone like Plato would argue that’s because art is by nature representational. What art does is represent the ‘real world’.</strong></p>\n<p>Plato was an extreme compartmentaliser. He wanted to separate everything into categorical divisions: what is human, what is an animal; what is real, what is ideal and so on. Where I disagree with this perspective is when the truth is placed in an intangible location, accessible only to men of standing, philosopher kings. Concepts like ‘justice’ are suddenly placed completely outside of our immediate and shared human experience and only accessible to a subsection of people. Out of this you generate an immediate social hierarchy.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/251614037?byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>Tell us about the political side of this album.</strong></p>\n<p>When I was London, I would start every day with a walk around this small park in Arnos Grove. It struck me how often I would be walking there and I would hear the sound of helicopters. And the underground was just full of adverts trying to get you to monetise your own debts. It was like an extreme subjectivisation of yourself as a commodity. The majority of talking points in London seemed to be making rent and being successful. There was a kind of weight permeating the air, a pressure to give in to the “there is no alternative” consensus. At some point I got really tired of the same voices, in politics, newspapers, fiction… repeating ad nauseam that this is how it is going to be, there is no alternative. I have been lucky to experience how people have an enormous capacity of mutual aid and solidarity, even though the circumstances and power structures do everything they can to sabotage it. I kept asking: how can I investigate this? I had the idea of imagining the 'infernal machine' as a biological outgrowth that we could surgically investigate with sound. I split the album in two halves: on the one hand, here’s the current situation (you’re alienated from the rest of the world, you have debts, you have to see yourself as an investment); on the other hand there’s also an anarchic solidarity, a sense of community and warmth, that keeps people human. The tension between these two poles was on my mind a lot.</p>\n<p><strong>I understand you have written some pieces for Black Mirror. What are your thoughts on it as a show?</strong></p>\n<p>I think Black Mirror has an acute understanding of our current trajectory: smartphone addiction, social status and ratings, the dehumanisation necessary for war and so on. But I also think that most current sci-fi is intellectually lazy: there is nothing extraordinarily creative about taking the development of the last 10 years and mirroring it linearly another five, 10 years into the future. I think that at this point dystopian fiction has become so much the dominant vision of the future that it becomes reactionary instead of critical. If the future is exclusively imagined as dystopia in contemporary fiction, it loses its critical function and becomes a smokescreen. The message is: the only future we can imagine is a slightly worse version then the present – accept it. I much prefer the science fiction of someone like Ursula le Guin: for all its imperfections and vulnerabilities, it dares to imagine alternatives (worlds without gender, or anarchist communes on the moon), with all the difficult, far-reaching questions that they bring along.</p>\n<p><strong>It seem like for many people, watching dystopian sci-fi can become a surrogate for serious thinking about transforming society: ending capitalism, patriarchy and so on.</strong></p>\n<p>I guess that these dystopia provide some temporary relief, in the sense of 'it’s quite bad now but not as bad as it could be' in the same way as a Macron needs a Le Pen to be perceived as acceptable. But that kind of reasoning reproduces the power structures by making them seem inevitable. Neither the 'there is no alternative' camp of neoliberal hegemony, nor the nihilism of fundamentalists (whatever brand) are workable ways of dealing with our present situation. And the ubiquity of dystopia as a past time says something about privilege too. Take climate change: we have the option to be endlessly fatalistic about it because we are in a privileged part of the world. We’re not farmers in the Mekong Delta or poor inhabitants of New Orleans. There, climate change is not some metaphysical problem, it’s not an abstract set of statistics, not a script for a Netflix series, it’s a brutal reality. We have a responsibility not to think of the end of the world as merely fiction – and thus, a responsibility to dare to imagine alternative ways of organising our societies, however difficult that is.</p>\n<p><em>'A Biology of Shadows' will be released by In Aulis on February 23rd.

    "content": "<p>I'm unsure how best to describe the Re:st or the 'Relation Reset' label as it's otherwise known. On the one hand, nearly all of its offerings occupy 160+ BPM tempos, yet to term it as a drum and bass label in the classic sense would probably leave a lot of jump-up heads disappointed. Re:st operate at the very periphery of the genre, dabbling in everything from skittish percussive experiments to low-gravity ambience.</p>\n<p>The same assessment can rightly be applied to their latest signee - Romanian artist Eduard Costea aka Dyl. His 'Hybridisation' EP, due for release on Re:st in the next few weeks has as much in common with noise cassette labels like Hobo Cult as it does the legacy of D&amp;B. The opener, 'Anthropomorphism' for example is packed with the kind of joyous electroacoustic oddities you might find in a Frank Oppenheimer thriller, twitching its way through factory hits and crumbling distortions.</p>\n<p>Included in the EP is a collaboration with Hidden Hawaii mainstay Dylan Brownsword aka DB1, entitled 'Veil of Ignorance'. The track is the most identifiable of the lot in terms of being a D&amp;B track, yet it still enjoys its own quirks along the way.

    "content": "<p>Despite releasing albums since the early-2000s and working with everyone from Blixa Bargeld to Iggy Pop, Carsten Nicolai, aka Alva Noto, has been at pains not to term himself a musician. I remember watching a panel discussion where he mused that despite releasing over ten albums, he barely owned a single instrument. Instead he chooses to work with scientific tools: oscillators, waveform generators and basic audio processors. Rather than thinking in terms of tempo, time-signatures and harmonies, it’s a question of grid sizes, frequencies and oscillation speeds.</p>\n<p>Carsten was born in 1965 in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR), growing up in Karl-Marx-Stadt – now Chemnitz – before moving to Dresden to study landscape architecture, a subject that still interests him and which perhaps explains his mathematical approach to composition. He also explored visual art, which led him to begin experimenting with sound, with a particular focus on rhythm and the extreme ends of the frequency spectrum. Carsten’s releases feature bass frequencies so low they are felt physically rather than heard on the scales we have become accustomed to. Similarly, his music frequently includes piercing high-end tones; 14kHz is a particular favourite of his – the test tone emitted by East German TV sets during intervals between programmes.</p>\n<p>It’s not all lab coats and oscilloscopes though. You can catch recordings of him on Boiler Room with one finger raised in the air, blasting the audience with static and sine wave techno hybrids. Similarly, the label he co-ran for nearly 20 years, Raster-Noton, features plenty of work straddling the line between electronic academia and tongue-in-cheek pop or dance abstractions. Take a listen to Atom™’s chart music satire <em>HD</em>, or Kyoka’s disjointed vocal collages on the ‘Ish’ EP for example.</p>\n<p>Raster-Noton began as a joining together of Carsten’s NOTON imprint and Olaf Bender’s Raster Media in 1999, separating into two labels again in mid-2017. NOTON resumed operations as a solo imprint earlier this year with <em>Live 2002</em>, dusting off an archived live collaboration between Carsten, Ryoji Ikeda and Pan Sonic’s Mika Vainio, who sadly passed away last year. The label is also shortly set to release <em>Glass</em>, a joint project from Carsten and long-term collaborator Ryuichi Sakamoto. The project saw the pair invited to record an improvised performance at Philip Johnson’s Glass House in Connecticut, playing a range of instruments as well as using contact mics to extract tones from the building itself. The recording is an enigmatic and meditative listen, picking up on the building’s tranquility, but also an uneasy sense of isolation.</p>\n<p>We caught up with Carsten last week to discuss <em>Glass</em>, celebrity budgies and what it was like growing up behind the iron curtain.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m enjoying your album with Ryuichi Sakamoto, <em>Glass</em>. It differs slightly from your other work in that it features – dare I say it – you playing something approaching an actual instrument. You were playing the crotales with something like a string bow?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah. I think it has a little bit to do with the fact we’ve recorded five albums together, more or less. There was no plan to continue recording more because for us they are kind of complete. During the last tour, four years ago, Ryuichi got cancer as you probably heard. We stopped touring while Ryuichi focused on his health and recovered. I think this changed how we wanted to continue with our collaborations.</p>\n<p>One idea was not to plan as much as we did before. To keep projects more open and have a level of improvisation; don’t have tracks that you need to replay, but instead step into completely new territory. One of the first offers we got was to make a really beautiful improvised show in the Glass House. A friend of mine – Irene Shum – who wrote some liner notes in the record, she initiated that project.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/395842260&color=%23e2e2e2&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>You two were reacting to her proposal?</strong></p>\n<p>Right. I studied architecture and actually there was always a plan to look for unusual performance locations. We talked for a long time about doing a project in Barcelona in the Mies van der Rohe Pavilion which was kind of a blueprint for the Glass House. He [Philip Johnson] designed it I think maybe twelve years later. We wanted to take the architecture as the instrument. It’s why the album is called <em>Glass</em>, because the building is made of glass. We added some instruments based on this idea.</p>\n<p>I think what was radically different in this case was that Ryuichi was only using acoustic instruments and electronics, not the piano.</p>\n<p><strong>So you’ve switched places a little bit?</strong></p>\n<p>[Laughs] Kind of! I was playing some acoustic instruments because it felt very natural in that location. It was a great restart to our collaboration. I completely agreed with Ryuichi in that we didn’t want to start at the point we stopped – touring and playing existing tracks that we’d already recorded. We wanted something totally open and new.</p>\n<p>Because we’ve known each other for so long, we didn’t need to talk much about what we wanted to do, we just did it. It feels very new to me to improvise in a situation and see what happens.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4754/25406226617_69563f1660_b.jpg\" alt=\"r\"></p>\n<p><strong>Do you remember your first meeting with Ryuichi, and what’s it like looking back on 20 years working together?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah I remember it quite well. It was in ‘97 I think, so 21 years ago. It was my first trip to Japan; I was invited by the German Goethe-Institut with Oval, Porter Ricks and Ryoji Ikeda. Our first gig was in Tokyo. Afterwards I was with a few friends including Ryoji and some people I didn’t know – I didn’t know many people at this point because it was my first trip to Japan. I met a lot of people then that I’m still in contact with and Ryuichi was there watching the performance.</p>\n<p>Ryuichi is a very open-minded person and he asked me if I would be interested in remixing some stuff. I said of course; at this time he’d just released an album which was more like Brazilian music I would say – it seemed very far away from what I was doing. Around that time I was going a very experimental way; working with high frequencies, sine wave constellations… He gave me the material and I did a remix. He loved the remix and he more or less kept sending me material…</p>\n<p><strong>…for 20 years.</strong></p>\n<p>Kind of! [Laughs] I mean now it’s a little bit different, sometimes we have a focused situation like when we worked together on <em>The Revenant</em>. I’ve collaborated with him on a few little soundtracks before too, like my own short movies.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/331999576&color=%23e2e2e2&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Is it true you made an opera about a budgie?</strong></p>\n<p>That’s the opera with Michael Nyman. We called it an opera but of course it was not a real opera. It has a vibrato and a wonderful story behind it. We only did one performance but I still have all the recordings and materials. We always wanted to publish a book about it because there’s so much material about this budgie.</p>\n<p><strong>It featured on lots of TV ads and so on right?</strong></p>\n<p>It did. The woman who had this budgie was kind of teaching him to talk. He became so famous that there have been some records released of him talking and singing, and then they used him for advertisements and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>A celebrity budgie.</strong></p>\n<p>[Laughs] A celebrity budgie. The backbone of the story is very interesting; he got humanised. In a way he was trained to speak, but on the other hand everybody thought he was a real human. It happens very often with pets when you love them too much, they get humanised and in the end they become like a family member. This budgie was almost a perfect example of how much a pet can become a member of the family. It’s a great psychological study too because they did some research and they found a diary as if it was written by the budgie! It was a little bit curious but at the same time fascinating.</p>\n<p>In terms of electronic music, John Cage wrote a book about birds and electronic music. It had this kind of feedback system into the fact that birds have influenced electronic music for a long time. It became a kind of conceptual work in the end but I liked it.</p>\n<p><strong>Going back to the Glass House, I was reading about how Philip Johnson initially lived there but in the end used it just for entertaining; it brought him a fair bit of unwanted attention from what I can tell. Apparently Yale architecture students made a bit of a game out of trespassing on the property. What were your impressions of the space the first time you visited?</strong></p>\n<p>If you know the Mies van der Rohe Pavilion, you can see the inspiration clearly. I think for him it was such a modernist icon. He tried to build something like it for himself. I think as an architect you always have the problem that you would like to do radical things but it’s very dependent on who gives you money or the purpose of the building. This building only served one purpose; it was for him a very experimental building I would say, but at the same time he could be as radical as he wanted because it was for him.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4762/39380451725_5e85b20836_z.jpg\" alt=\"p\"></p>\n<p><strong>It’s nice to see something like that actually get built as so many experimental buildings just remain as blueprints.</strong></p>\n<p>I think it’s always interesting to see this kind of small scale building, especially as Philip Johnson was mainly doing large scale buildings – skyscrapers and so on. He changed his style from very modernist to post-modernist and back. I think the family own the property and there are also three more buildings there and some other structures. You can see that he was trying to build pavilions and experimental things where he could learn about how to approach his bigger buildings. It was very obvious.</p>\n<p>The Glass House is kind of radical in a way because the first time you enter the Glass House it’s very beautiful, but you’re asking yourself is this a place I could live? It feels like a house for a single person rather than a couple or something and I think he built it more for studying and for isolating himself.</p>\n<p><strong>How far down the line did you get yourself as an architect?</strong></p>\n<p>I studied architecture but I specialised in landscape design. I studied during the East German times, the GDR times. During that period it was problematic because there wasn’t much experimental architecture. There was social housing and very generic modular buildings. The architectural standard was very low I would say. The perspective studying architecture in East Germany was very sad. You study the radical ideas of 1921 and know that you’re never going to build anything like that…</p>\n<p>This was the same period I studied deconstructivism. A lot of these architects did projects in this time that were so conceptual and radical that no-one ever thought they were going to build anything. In a way this is the reason I was so interested. Coop Himmelb(l)au, or Daniel Libeskind; for me it was always a surprise that Daniel Libeskind built buildings because I never thought about it. I thought it was more conceptual work. His drawings were a big inspiration for me but it was more or less paper architecture let’s say.</p>\n<p>Studying architecture, I was more interested in the conceptual ideas and I am still very influenced by this kind of thing.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/23469734&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Can I ask you a little bit about that time in East Germany? I read in another interview that when you were younger the TV was always on, and there’s a frequency you use that was emitted in old TV sets which gave you a feeling of comfort. What kind of things were you watching, and were you intercepting broadcasts from the West as well?</strong></p>\n<p>You have to understand in that time TV stations didn’t broadcast the whole time. It was only specific programmes; it was mainly in the morning. Programmes for teaching and then they stopped until the afternoon. Then there were more entertaining programmes. A lot of movies that were liked in East Germany, but it was a very limited selection. There were a lot of Fellini movies, for example, maybe because of his political and social criticisms on capitalism.</p>\n<p>The biggest influence for me was maybe not the TV programmes, but the test picture [laughs]. It was basically a test frequency and a test picture… There would be eight hours of programmes and then 14 hours of test picture! The only thing that was moving on the test picture was the digital clock [laughs]. I think it was a 14kHz tone or something like that in the background.</p>\n<p><strong>I was reading about the guy who presented ‘The Black Channel’, which was essentially used to denounce or reinterpret Western broadcasts…</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah I remember this programme; ‘Die Schwarze Kanal’. Karl-Eduard von Schnitzler was the presenter. For us it was clear that it was propaganda…</p>\n<p>It’s a funny story with him because his name tells you he is from an aristocratic background, but he became a communist in the end. He was criticising capitalism; he took the news from Western TV and he was giving you background information saying that it’s all lies. Of course as a viewer you didn’t believe it.</p>\n<p><strong>I see your work as very boundary pushing in lots of senses… Do you feel the fact that there was the opposite of that when you were growing up – lots of artistic repression – had an impact on you? Did that inspire you to push things further when the wall came down and you had this freedom?</strong></p>\n<p>Of course, I think that’s a big influence. Some things you realise much later that you are being influenced by, even if you thought you weren’t. I think this is a very natural situation; everyone is influenced by their childhood. I think as children we didn’t really have the whole picture because it was a very local situation for us, it was the Cold War. Everything was very politicised every day and I think when you become a teenager then you start looking to alternative information sources. Music was very important for us during this period because music was the main media where you could find alternatives of how to live your life, let’s say. A simple example is that you could ask someone which band he likes and know how he’s politically thinking or the mood he’s in. If he likes The Cure he’s a depressed guy maybe or if he’s into The B52s he’s more happy.</p>\n<p><strong>You mentioned just then how if you listen to The Cure you might be a fairly sort of demure character; I was wondering how you see your own work in that light? I often feel like you’re presented as quite a serious figure, maybe because your work takes a lot from science and mathematics. Do you see yourself as this serious researcher or is there still something playful and fun about making music?</strong></p>\n<p>Totally. I think when you do music you can’t ignore this and maybe this is the biggest fascination. Even if you have a very analytic way of approaching music or take a lot of influence from psychoacoustics; if you’re trying to find out what is sound, what are frequencies and what are electromagnetic waves…</p>\n<p>I was very interested in reading more about what exactly sound is but in the end, even with this background and even with experimental music it has a very individual approach. You do things you like basically. Even if you can’t describe why; there’s no conscious explanation of what you just did. This is the beauty of music too, that it has this power. You do things with a certain discipline and then at some point you can say I like this a lot and I think this is part of the process with music. Maybe you realise at some point that you do music; I always had a problem calling myself a composer.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you feel more relaxed about calling yourself a musician now? I mean we talked earlier about how on <em>Glass</em> you’re playing the crotales…</strong></p>\n<p>I think it’s much easier for me to say that I do music now, in the past I found it difficult. It’s just an acceptance maybe, after realising that you’ve put out a lot of records already… [laughs]</p>\n<p>You meet people too; like I worked with Blixa [Bargeld] from [Einstürzende] Neubauten. As a musician you are very isolated, you listen to a lot of stuff but you always work in isolation and think it’s only happening to you. When I met Blixa and he was telling me about the early days I was fascinated that so many other musicians started in a similar way to me, not knowing that in the end they are musicians.</p>\n<p>The music world is full of these people that didn’t study music and started just doing things. They started from a different angle and a different background, but great music appeared in the end.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/355541294&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I wanted to ask a little bit about the divergence of Raster Media and NOTON if that’s OK; NOTON is going to be your own projects right?</strong></p>\n<p>For now, yeah; it’s still in process. We separated our labels mainly because after 20 years some part of the structure of Raster-Noton became like too serious of a label? It was always founded as a tool for us; an artist tool let’s say. Some parts of the label became so important that we couldn’t really tell any more if we were a label or if we were artists. It was always two labels; Olaf [Bender] was based in Chemnitz and I was based in Berlin…</p>\n<p>I think the main motivation of the label was independence. In the beginning we achieved a lot of this independence because there was a strong group feel. We had serious concepts, the layout and design that everyone had to follow; but maybe ten years ago we started realising that it was about individual projects rather than group projects. Frank [Bretschneider] left the label – we still kept him as a member of course but he was not very interested in label work anymore, he wanted to do his music – he moved to Berlin and then I moved to Berlin. I think there was a moment where we simply had to decide to go our own ways because Olaf wanted to do the label, and I wanted to follow stronger artistic concepts rather than building a structure around a label.</p>\n<p><strong>Was it something that happened suddenly or were you thinking about it for a long time?</strong></p>\n<p>The whole process and the discussions started five years ago already. To be honest, we were afraid that we would lose opportunities not working together anymore. We tried to figure out what could be a good model for continuing, but in the end there weren’t many options. We decided to separate and see what would happen.</p>\n<p><strong>It must have been quite daunting in the sense Raster-Noton is a very established name. I know the label was always a collaboration between Raster and NOTON but that was certainly news to me when I heard about the split. Lots of people don’t know the complete history of the labels.</strong></p>\n<p>In the background there is a lot of very boring stuff. You have to figure out publishing rights, mastering deals, all this stuff. Basically in the end these discussions became kind of stiff. There wasn’t much movement happening and we didn’t know how to react to it. To run a label these days is difficult because you have to exploit yourself and the other people on the label as well in order to make something that will work financially.</p>\n<p>I always wanted to wait for the 20-year anniversary so we could publish the book. In a way, when we published the book and had this installation done – the big Berghain show – this was the moment for me when I said it’s time to start something different. Even if you give up on something that had a great impact and was very positively communicated on the outside… Sometimes you have to break yourself in order to continue.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4710/39272081185_9755f8fe92_b.jpg\" alt=\"k\"></p>\n<p><strong>Next on your own label is <em>UNIEQAV</em>, which you’re also playing at the Barbican. Can you tell me a bit about the album? Anne-James Chaton is playing with you at the Barbican as well right?</strong></p>\n<p>It was a natural choice because we’ve been collaborating a lot; he was always part of the <em>Uni</em> series. He had a performance project based on his own texts I worked on with him and we’re actually working on a new collaborative show at the moment. It will probably premiere next month.</p>\n<p>To come back to my album, I have this tendency towards concept albums as you maybe realised [laughs]. I started with the <em>Transform</em> series, then the <em>Uni</em> series and the <em>Xerrox</em> series. For <em>Uni</em>, the idea was always to do three records sitting in between experimental music and club music. I was diving more into rhythmic concepts. If you listen to <em>UNIEQAV</em>, it’s between rhythmic music you can listen to at home or in a club; sitting between these situations. The Barbican is a seated venue so I don’t know if that’s good or bad… It will work there too, but it could also work in a small club in Japan.</p>\n<p>I’m always collecting material and I know it’s time to record when I have enough material. I took a different approach with this album. I built the live set first and then played a few tracks to see how they felt. During the recording process I realised that I wanted to add many more tracks. It was a very fast process in a way. It took me like half a year to finish.</p>\n<p><strong>I wanted to ask a bit about <em>Live 2002</em> – it had been sitting in hibernation for a bit?</strong></p>\n<p>I discovered it in the archives, it was the only recording I had from when me and Ryoji [Ikeda] performed together with Mika [Vainio]. The main reason I put it out as the first record was because Mika died last year. Me and Ryoji wanted to support his family and decided to do a release and give the family the money. Theoretically we probably wouldn’t have put that record out because if we had the option to touch it again we all would do it differently. We said no, let’s release it as a document as we can never touch it again.</p>\n<p><strong>It felt wrong to do anything to it without Mika being part of the process?</strong></p>\n<p>Of course. We had to edit it down a little bit because some parts were very distorted so we had to cut them off. We took at least ten minutes of pure noise out – we all loved that noise attack in the live situation, but on a recorded work maybe not… We wanted to emphasise the quieter parts.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/368412137&color=%23e2e2e2&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Do you remember your first interactions with Mika and the first time you heard Pan Sonic?</strong></p>\n<p>I think the first record I got was <em>Vakio</em>; it came as this beautiful blue 10”. They were called Panasonic at that time. I had a meeting with Mika when he was living in Toku and then I was living in New York and going between the two places. That’s how I met him. We worked on <em>Mikro Makro</em> together, became friends and continued working together. We lived in New York at the same time and did some more recordings.</p>\n<p><strong>You have previously mentioned the importance of having a really good soundsystem to listen to your music. Do you think about the listener’s resources? I’m lucky enough to have decent speakers but lots of people wouldn’t be able to afford a quality soundsystem.</strong></p>\n<p>There was a period where a lot of people asked me what kind of speakers they should listen to my music on. I’m not going to give recommendations as it should work on everything; that’s a part of the mastering process.</p>\n<p><strong>I had a friend that used to master in his car…</strong></p>\n<p>A car is the best! I always say if the mastering works in the car then it works everywhere. It’s definitely one of the best places you should test your CD. I always test in my car before mastering even, to see how the mixes sound. When you have a long drive you have plenty of time so you can see what works.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m learning to drive at the moment and I’ve stopped thinking about music in the same way; the question now is would this sound good driving on the motorway.</strong></p>\n<p>The great thing about driving is it becomes a road movie automatically. You’re creating the soundtrack. One of the best visualisations for music is driving through a tunnel at night. It works with any music I think [laughs]. It’s so filmic it’s kind of unbelievable. I think there must be hundreds of movies where they have these scenes, because it works so well.</p>\n<p><em>'Glass' is <a href=\"https://boomkat.com/products/glass-a195dde5-6810-4148-8382-6def218da337\">available now</a> on 12&quot; vinyl.</em></p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/191205737?color=ffffff&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Despite its seeming nascence, coded music has a long history. During the slave trade, people in Nigeria and Ghana used drum telegraphy to communicate with each other over long distances. When colonial European intruders came into the jungles, message of their arrival and their intention was often carried through the woods a step in advance. A transmission through drumming could travel at a speed of 100 miles per hour. This 'coded drumming' was thus banned by the slave owners, as it functioned as a secret language and a tool for resistance.</p>\n<p>Musicians as far back as the Baroque period have also included hidden messages (or 'musical cryptograms') in their scores. Most notably, Bach included <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BACH_motif\">his own signature</a> into his music in an act of bizzare narcissism. Pauline Oliveros even used a C-A-G-E motif for her obituary piece for John Cage, <em>CAGE DEAD</em>. I've often thought that someone should do an A-C-A-B motif as a coded song against the police.</p>\n<p>Musical cryptograms received some unwanted attention in the 80s when Christian fundamentalists began accusing heavy metal bands like Led Zeppelin of 'backmasking' satanic messages into their music. The claim was that listening to 'Stairway to Heaven' backwards would reveal sinister commands and ritualistic mantras for the malleable minds of youngsters. Inspired by these spurious lawsuits, Slayer made the ingenious twist of logic to <em>purposefully</em> include clear and obvious satanic messages in their music. When under fire for supposedly corrupting the youth, vocalist Tom Araya explained that these messages were, &quot;purely for effect...&quot;</p>\n<p>Now we have 'live-coding', a technique that seems almost ubiquitous in underground electronic music, from Tokyo's Japanoise scene to the 'Algorave' parties. Here, the underlying programming code of the music is projected on to a wall, for the audience to follow and admire. This serves two interesting purposes. First, it has a democratising effect, in that it allows the audience to see the source of the sound. 'Laptop-DJing' (such as Gold Panda's so-called 'space-bar sets') have been lampooned for their closed-off nature. The running joke goes that DJs are just playing iTunes and checking E-mails. But live-coding dodges this problem by giving full disclosure to the audience. This anti-hierarchical attitude resonances throughout the coding community, who unite through shared values of open-source mutualism and transparency.</p>\n<p>The second interesting effect of live-coding is the reintroduction of a visual element. Earlier this month, <a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/mixes/0084-daniel-karlsson\">Daniel M Karlsson</a> told us that he has become, &quot;enchanted by the look and feel of The Terminal&quot;. Indeed, many artists have taken the spectacle of code to new levels. Throughout their work, Ryoji Ikeda and TCF encourage us to gawk at dazzling flickers of numbers and data. AGF has even found beauty in speaking code live, like a kind of poetry of programming. The 'pure effect' of coded messages that Slayer employed is also found in the music of Boards of Canada. BOC's music makes you feel as though you are being hypnotised by subliminal messages. Uncanny voices run through the alphabet and random number sequences to create a sense of nostalgic whimsy. But the messages themselves don't really matter, it's the effect that counts.</p>\n<p>Today, there is something potent in the mixture of fear and love that we share for our computers. Economics, employment, entertainment and even our love-lives are beholden by streams of big data and faceless algorithms. Art that takes code as its subject seems to suggest either a caution against the future or the worship of a new master. The question is: why is the information encoded? Who does it protect? Who does it exclude? In which direction is the power flowing?</p>\n<p>In this episode of Stray Landings FM, we spoke to Jasmine Guffond and Calum Gunn about code, codification and codified music.

    "content": "<p>Derek Piotr is busier than ever with a string of new projects in the works. His new album, <em>Grunt</em> (meaning 'earth' or 'ground' in Polish), will be released later this year. The name 'Grunt' also suggests a mean, animalistic sound. Perhaps a response to his 2017 'pop' record on Bit-Phalanx. Indeed, anyone trying to predict what the album might sound like could look at the <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/derek-piotr\">recordings</a> of his most recent noise tour. Expect an album of growls, snarls and barks in what looks to be his nastiest album yet.</p>\n<p>But before the release of <em>Grunt</em>, Piotr is also set to release a <a href=\"https://lineimprint.bandcamp.com/album/underlined\">series of remixes</a> on Richard Chartier’s LINE imprint. Here, extracts from Piotr's sprawling career get reworked by the likes of France Jobin and AGF. Piotr has also been busy launching his own podcast, B E A U T Y, featuring interviews with Safety Scissors, Maja Ratkje, C. Spencer Yeh and many more. You can find all previous episodes of the show <a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/radiodotcomputer/playlists/beauty/\">here</a>. To celebrate these new projects, we caught up with Piotr to discuss the shows that have shaped his sound.</p>\n<p>###Issue Project Room with Thomas Brinkmann _ 2017</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4747/26584091778_cba543a7d9_h.jpg\" alt=\"3\"></p>\n<p>I had approached issue in early 2016 to play a show in their space. I had seen several concerts put on by them in their main boerum space, most notably a performance of Morton Feldman's &quot;For Philip Guston&quot; and I was so envious of the performers for being able to interact with the acoustics in that room. Issue agreed to host a performance of mine but requested that i choose a more established artist to pair with; I immediately chose Thomas. He and I had worked on a piece for my 2016 record <em>Drono</em> called 'Absolute Grey'. In addition to us performing solo sets, we played a 30 minute rendition of that piece. Laurel Halo was also on the bill. It was great fun hanging around with Thomas the day after the gig in Issue's space, recording the reverb and discussing work.</p>\n<p>###22rpm festival, St. John in Bethnal Green _ 2017</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4656/40411332172_c20ce0ef96_h.jpg\" alt=\"1\"></p>\n<p>I was invited by one of my labels, Bit-Phalanx to partake in their 22rpm festival which they co-brainchilded with Japanese artist coppé. One of my bucket list wishes was to gig in a church and this provided a wonderful opportunity to do so. I am proud to say I disregarded all noise limit warnings and pushed my set into the red; testing out some new noise pieces I have been working on and playing a few pop tracks. My time after my set was gorgeous as well; I spent the majority of the evening hanging with Leila Arab and iPhone jamming on noisy synth apps and recording them to her little iPod shuffle. I also got to finally meet Stray Landings crew and Robin Rimbaud aka Scanner, bumping into Valgeir Sigurðsson was lovely as well.</p>\n<p>###NYU with winds ensemble _ 2015</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4759/40454990201_b24cb0d2b8_h.jpg\" alt=\"2\"></p>\n<p>This was the first time I'd been on stage with acoustic musicians for my work. I had written a solo album <em>Bahar</em> for release in 2015 and had worked with a friend, Kyle Tieman-Strauss (who is a fabulous composer) on re-arrangements of some of the solo material. Bahar as an album leaned heavily on woodwinds but Kyle's direction replaced most of my sounds entirely with the players. It was scary and yet somehow relaxing to be able to close my laptop and perform just with my voice. At one point I had to close my eyes to distract myself from the absence of my Macbook, electronic teddybear. Kyle and I went on to do several shows in this configuration (I was backed by clarinet, bass clarinet, and flute) but the first gig remains to me the scariest and most rewarding. Worth noting: Michael Gordon was in attendance!</p>\n<p><em>'Underlined' will be released on March 2nd, 2018 with LINE.

    "content": "<p>France Jobin's latest work, <em>Intrication</em>, takes its cues from aspects of quantum theory I'm not going to pretend to understand with much coherence. In essence, the album looks at a process known as 'quantum entanglement'; when particles interact in such a way that the quantum state of each cannot be described without reference to the other. The album puts the tiniest fragments under the microscope, revealing within them kaleidoscopic expanses.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact <em>Intrication</em> explores these scientific complexities, it could equally be replicating religious or near-death experiences. 'm' is a good example of this reverent quality; like an interlude from a cLOUDDEAD track stretched to the extreme. '03V' follows a similar mood, delicate sun-blushed washes of ambience lightly brushing past. Playing into France's concept for the album, this track forms part of a larger picture. The 'V' stands for 'vignette', and '01V' to '04V' are interspersed between the rest of the tracks, acting as a familiar motif throughout.</p>\n<p>While these act as palette cleansing interludes, the tracks between cover more wide-ranging territory. One of the albums greatest nuances is the combination of natural and synthetic tones. Take 'graviton' for example, a glorious combination of warm, expansive dub-ambience and microcopic static pulses. Perhaps the crux of <em>Intrication</em>, 'e-', is another case in point. Delicate chimes ring across the stereo field, gentle reverberations rising and falling abruptly in the backdrop. These resonant twinkles are eventually met by undulating low-end structures, the chimes dissolving into itching twitches of static.</p>\n<p>It's fitting <em>Intrication</em> sees its release on Material Object and Atom™'s 'No.' label. Throughout his own work Atom™ has explored similar mediations between the scientific and the psychedelic (take a listen to his mid-90s DATacide project for example). Speaking with France about her interpretation of quantum entanglement through the album, she discussed applying the same concept to the relationship between sound and our perception of it. At this point the question becomes almost a philosophical one; as we are presented with the possibility that each of our perceptions may differ, although still pertaining to the same 'real world' sound. Whatever our sensory differences might be however, there is a joyous sense of wonder and cosmic discovery to be found throughout <em>Intrication</em>; a considered tribute to the unknown.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=746690917/size=small/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/artwork=none/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://no-ware.bandcamp.com/album/intrication\">Intrication by France Jobin</a></iframe>",

The label have been in operation for just over two years, beginning as a platform for releases from 'Infinite Fields'. These early EPs are synth-y, high-octane tech-house. But fast forward a few months and the label are about to release some seriously extreme plunderphonic breakcore noise (or 'computer music', for short). So how did we get here?</p>\n<p>&quot;I don’t have a musical background&quot;, he begins. &quot;I started listening to a lot of music very young but never properly studied it. I remember going to the library, borrowing some CDs in order to rip them at home, returning them and doing it again. It was almost faster than downloading at that time! I think listening to a lot of music without knowing its theory has helped me develop an approach based on perceptions. I rely on what it makes me feel, what it conveys in terms of sensation. I also like to document my listening, learn about the context of a record, the history of a movement, and the ideas its protagonists were saying&quot;.</p>\n<p>In anticipation of their new release from ＧＡＭＥＳＨＡＲＫ™, Quanta Records have provided the latest installment of our mix series.

    "content": "<p>It could just be me getting older, but I’ve noticed a growing popularity for techno events with relatively sober punters and conservative closing hours. You might call it the Plastic People effect - a version of clubbing in which people are content to let the music carry them; they dance if they feel to, but it's not a necessity. <em>511593</em>, the long awaited debut album from Susanne Kirchmayr aka Electric Indigo, seems to have tapped into this one-foot-in-the-club approach. The album drifts between pointed warehouse abstractions, mottled ambience and well-tempered hybrids of each, nightlife soundtracks recalled with varying levels of lucidity.</p>\n<p>The album features rusted impressionist monoliths such as dank ambient thriller ‘Second Organ’, or the sun-blushed modulations of ‘Darcy In Paradise’. However it also includes head-scrambling scaffold techno like on ‘Ntandathu’ or ‘Sept’, a track repackaged from Kirchmayr’s excellent Het-released ‘Seven’ EP. Then there are offerings like ‘Trois’, a wickedly slurred take on something like ‘Autobahn’ meets Anne-James Chaton. Clinical diagnosis readings fall into line alongside shattered glass percussion and caustic melodies.</p>\n<p>There's often an inclination to term music of this nature as 'dark' or 'foreboding', yet what I hear is an album teeming with energy and an eagerness to explore. This is made all the more impressive by the fact Kirchmayr has been releasing music as Electric Indigo since 1993; indeed it's hard to believe the author of adrenaline-pumped speed-acid of 'Skyway' or 'No Headroom' is the same as that of <em>511593</em>.</p>\n<p>Asking her about her distinct meeting of granular experimentalism and roughshod techno rhythms in 2015, she said: &quot;I feel that I have to go further - I’m not there yet.&quot; The destination may well have been reached here; she has tackled something often attempted, yet rarely carried off so successfully.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/384970769&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Quanta Records are set to release <em>SHARK 4 お歯黒</em>, the fourth full length LP from Echo Hazard under her ＧＡＭＥＳＨＡＲＫ™ moniker. With a name like that, in near-parody vapourware font, and matching 90s cyberspace artwork, it might be tempting to dismiss a release like this as a cartoonish meme. But in the accompanying press release, Quanta reveal that the album is inspired by a much older (and better hidden) art movement: Flashcore.</p>\n<p>In 1998, the French imprint Hangars Liquides, founded by Laurent Mialon (or 'La Peste') defined Flashcore as, “the spatial and temporal conception of air landscapes of which ‘sonic atoms’ are being controlled with the exclusive aim of making us explore our minds and perceive any kind of transcendence”. In simpler terms, Flashcore plays with tempo and rhythm in its extremities. Expect anxiety-inducing BPMs and a barrage of unique kick samples.</p>\n<p>This latest release from ＧＡＭＥＳＨＡＲＫ™ is a ride through sonic pyrotechnics and hyper-engineered production trickery. Often, the tempos slip down or up mid-track, making the whole experience joyfully disorientating. It is wrong-footing at every step: every time the pulse seems to stabilise, the rug is pulled from underneath.</p>\n<p>In an exclusive for Stray Landings, ＧＡＭＥＳＨＡＲＫ™ has shared a track from her new album, out on March 20th on Quanta Records.

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Hanna Kihlander.</em></p>\n<p>When we last spoke to Andreas Tilliander in 2015, he was laying his Mokira project to rest for a while. He noted it was one of the few projects he was entirely comfortable with, so it's understandable that he might not want to jeopardise a more or less immaculate run. Given this, it was somewhat of a surprise to see a new full-length Mokira offering emerge this year in the form of <em>Chill Out</em>. Tilliander can rest easy though, as Mokira's discography remains unblemished.</p>\n<p>Across six tracks of aquatic dub-ambience, we reach Mariana Trench level depths. Despite this, <em>Chill Out</em> is far from an exercise in crafting the darkest, most brooding soundscapes possible. Tracks like 'Kobbar' or 'Cancelled Show in Paris' sit in catatonic bliss, bugged-out arpeggios and woozy synthetic motifs drifting by innocuously.  Other offerings such as 'Cuchla Congos' and 'Octa Octaves' drift in and out of gauzy, faded stupors, vaporous atmospherics and tumbling rhythms locked in hypnotic sway. <em>Chill Out</em> is an album for the after party's after party; those roll-throughs where we cling to the night before in smoke-filled living rooms with the curtains tightly drawn.</p>\n<p>Tilliander will be dusting off the Mokira guise again for a live performance at this year's edition of Intonal Festival in Malmö. Entering its fourth year, Intonal will bring together choice Nordic talents such as Tilliander himself, Aleksi Perälä and Ellen Arkbro, as well as internationally revered acts such as Charlamagne Palestine, Pan Daijing and Japanese noise-wave duo Group A.</p>\n<p>In light of the Mokira project's reemergence, we invited Tilliander to contribute to our That Time When series, discussing five of his most memorable gigging experiences...</p>\n<p>###Advanced Art in Hässleholm, Sweden _ 1993</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/801/25974405167_cd50cdd4cd_b.jpg\" alt=\"a\"></p>\n<p>I made my live debut in March 1993 when I was 15 years old. It was during a night of electronic 'body music' in my hometown of Hässleholm, Sweden. I was singing in a band. I’m an awful singer and I knew that back then too, so I was super nervous. The headlining act was this Finnish band called Advanced Art. Their singer Jana is a short guy, and I’m over six foot. My band was called One Inch Too Small and after sound checking Jana approached me and said: ”One Inch Too Small? I can’t see that. Or maybe only the groupies will see that?” Being a virgin at the time, I responded with a nervous teenage smile...</p>\n<p>###Helsinki, Finland _ 1999</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/822/25974404757_c3565f7884_b.jpg\" alt=\"e\"></p>\n<p>The first time I got to play outside Sweden was in 1999 with my friends Mikael Stavöstrand and Benny Nilsen. We played in Finland, the neighbouring country to Sweden. There’s a ferry going from Stockholm to Helsinki that's legendary. It takes 16 hours each way and you get to purchase tax-free alcohol and listen to shitty live bands covering old Swedish and Finnish hits. People go on these ferries not to visit Finland or Sweden, but with the sole purpose of getting super drunk and dancing to the weird cover bands, returning home after 36 hours or so with a month's supply of cheap vodka. I once played on the ferry myself too...</p>\n<p>###Tokyo, Japan _ 2001</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4775/40804445412_cd8537e048_z.jpg\" alt=\"j\"></p>\n<p>Japan has always been my favourite country. When I was a kid I studied Japanese martial arts. I could tell you many stories about my eleven visits to the country (I’m being precise here because Kontra Musik's Ulf [Eriksson] always nags me about this). One of the favourite moments was playing during Onsen Festival in Nagano in 2013... You never forget your first love though and in 2001 I played in Tokyo for the first time. This was the second time ever that I was on a flight and I forgot to ask for vegan food so when asking on the flight I was handed an apple, a spoon and a napkin. The gig was also memorable. It was a sleeping bag concert, meaning I travelled to the other side of the globe to perform while people slept. I loved it.</p>\n<p>###Rhythm &amp; Sound in Amsterdam, Holland _ 2002</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/800/40831137441_c4d7525414_b.jpg\" alt=\"v\"></p>\n<p>If you’ve followed my record output, you probably know already that I’m a huge fan of all things Moritz von Oswald and Mark Ernestus. I think it was in 2002 that I opened for them and Tikiman in Amsterdam. While sitting backstage we got interviewed by a local journalist who thought I was part of the Rhythm &amp; Sound posse too. Mark and Moritz played along, so for a brief moment I felt that I was part of the best duo (well, trio then) ever.</p>\n<p>###Nadah El-Shazly at Fylkingen in Stockholm, Sweden _ 2018</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/818/25974403777_5de4b62579_b.jpg\" alt=\"q\"></p>\n<p>In January this year I witnessed a concert by Egypt's Nadah El-Shazly at Stockholm’s best venue, Fylkingen. It was something else, I tell you.\nFor some reason, I never listen to music with vocals anymore. Well, I sometimes listen to My Bloody Valentine, The Cure or some hip hop when I feel nostalgic. I really dig the voice of Nadah and I don’t speak any Arabic at all, so perhaps that’s one of the reasons I dig it. No lyrics for me to process while enjoying the music. I did an interview with her for my radio show 'Elektroniskt i P2' and her set at Fylkingen is the best I’ve heard this year. I’m looking forward hearing it again at this year's Intonal Festival in Malmö where we both are performing. My show will be very different from my usual live sets...</p>\n<p><em>Find further details about Intonal Festival on their <a href=\"http://www.intonalfestival.com/\">website</a>.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/428346344&color=%23919191&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\"></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p>The Stockholm cassette label Moloton are celebrating their first anniversary with the release of a new ambient album from Atonet, <em>Ido</em>. This release straddles the intriguing duality between contemporary electronics and gothic art. There is, I think, something specifically Nordic in this crossover. You can find it in the recent Swedish gabber revival (see HAJ300, Kablam etc), which takes the harsh deathly aesthetics of metal and applies them to hardcore. Then there is Fever Ray and The Knife, who use masks, face-paint and costumes borrowed from Paganism and the occult. Even the Stockholm Drone Society don matching biker-jackets, like the Hell's Angels of ambient.</p>\n<p>This latest release from Moloton taps into this idea, albeit from another angle. Where a lot of ambient music places the listener in a spacey Internet-netherworld, this music is tactile and grounded. A quick scan of the label imagery will also uncover bat wings and Medieval typeface. Indeed, although made with synthesisers and drum machines, the mood on <em>Ido</em> has more in common with Sunn 0)), Boris and Earth than it does with Oneohtrix Point Never or Emeralds. The opening drones of 'City in the Sky' and the heavy rumbles of 'Spine Hustle' sound like zombies emerging from the soil. There are also delicate moments on here, like the innocent steel pans of 'Angel Born Again' or 'Reality Crumbles'. The album concludes with 'Another Childhood', which rings out like a funeral organ, making one final return to the earth.</p>\n<p><em>Ido</em> is available now on Moloton records as a cassette limited to only 100 copies. Head over to their <a href=\"https://www.moloton.com/product/atonet-ido/\">website</a> to buy a copy.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jS5wHLdGjCc?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

Stacks of vinyl are placed on top of one another, each triggering a different loop and culminating in a towering cacophony of juddering mechanical techno. It's almost like an elaborate magic trick. Indeed, there is an incredible sense of danger with his work, as if everything could go wrong with one wobble of the table. This tense energy propels the show forward, and gives huge payoffs when it works.</p>\n<p>Dunning’s work is arguably part of the lineage in sound art that wishes to make a ‘return to the physical’, rediscovering the joys of pops and crackles in physical formats that contemporary music tries to hide. Christian Marclay is perhaps most known for this, famous for <em>Record Without a Cover</em>, an LP sold with no protective packaging such that each copy became a unique artefact with unique damages suffered in packaging, shipping and playing. Marclay was determined to remind us to look beyond the message and return our gaze to the medium.</p>\n<p>But unlike Marclay, Dunning’s work is more than an art gallery installation. In other words, it’s actually nice to listen to! His upcoming EP, <em>Way Too Much Time</em>, is an intricate and considered record that would be welcome on any dancefloor. ‘Protest Dub’ in particular takes me back to my first listening experiences of those early Maurizio 12”s: it’s raw, gritty and groovy as fuck.</p>\n<p>Ahead of his upcoming show with Edited Arts this month, we spoke to Dunning about vinyl, Jenga and 'mechanical techno'.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/413201019&color=%236464ac&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Your musical background is interesting insofar as you came more from Manchester’s noise-rock scene than any ‘sound art’ or art school experience.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah I was playing in noise bands and I’ve always been doing the DIY recording thing. I guess I was in my late 20s and realised I’m not gonna make it in a trendy indie band [laughs]. I just happened to get more into experimental music and I started to realise that more of my mates were 'artists' than musicians per se. It just opens up a lot more options if you call yourself an artist. There’s no pressure to get signed by a label, for one thing.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think you are seen more as an artist or as a musician?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m not sure - it’s interesting. My output has become more ‘musical’ I suppose. I started doing more abstract work with turntables, but since I started doing this ‘mechanical techno’ stuff it’s become a lot more beat-driven and accessible. But clearly there’s a big performative aspect to what I do so as well. I guess I’m somewhere in the middle.</p>\n<p><strong>Your new EP does strike me as being a lot less like the recording of an art installation. It sounds more like a classic 4-track 12”.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah I sometimes feel a bit split with my work in that sense. A lot of my output is simply recordings and edits of live shows. But I also make stuff in the studio, where it’s built in a totally different way and I can take my time. It becomes more about how it sounds than how it looks.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about mechanical techno, is it a process? A genre?</strong></p>\n<p>Well it loosely just means music that I make with mechanical parts. All the sound that I produce comes from the rotation of the turntable. If the turntable is off, everything is silent. When I do mechanical techno, I set myself certain rules. I build the machine in a certain way. It’s also always a live mix, no multi channel recording. The records that I sample are always white labels that I get second hand. So by the very nature of the white label, the samples tend to be from other dance music. Maybe I could make nicer music if I was sampling old 78s or organ music or something. But the limitation to white labels is an important part of the whole mechanical techno process, I think.</p>\n<p><strong>Limitations are often what make music interesting in the first place I guess.</strong></p>\n<p>I’m super into all the DIY home recording approach to music, precisely because of its limitations. I love it when you can hear how a piece of music was put together: you can see through the cracks, in a way. There’s an Arthur Russell track where this guitar part comes in way too loud [laughs] and for whatever reason it was mixed that way and it’s super jarring and abrupt, but it makes it really intriguing and endearing at the same time. That one guitar part is on the edge of ruining the whole piece but somehow it works.</p>\n<p>I’m currently editing down some new tracks of mine at the moment and I have the same problem. There’s a synth part in there that is just just way too loud so I’m having to chop and cut around it. But I like that those errors can force you to work in a different way. I could easily make a formulaic techno track (4 bars of kick, bring in the hats, 32 bars then drop et cetera) but then you fall into the same old patterns of behaviour.</p>\n<p><strong>I like a good sense of danger in music too. I want to feel like it could all go wrong in a second. Watching you build a tower of vinyls is like watching a game of Jenga or something.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah I think that’s what people engage with in my work. I could continue to refine the set up and make it super stable and resilient to fuck-ups but it would be too safe. I’ve chosen to keep it more dangerous because that’s what keeps it exciting for me to play. This way of playing keeps me surprised even now. Sometimes a loose cable catches onto the contraption and everything slows down [laughs]. When that happens I can’t help but grimace or laugh, but then the audience can see it’s not all smoke and mirrors.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wl1ZrEza7uY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>It’s amazing how the brain can find rhythm in those off-kilter loops too. You can find a beat in almost anything as long as it's got some repetition.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah the random aspects of my set are my favourite things about it. Sometimes I can be totally lost trying to find the pulse amongst all of these arthymical samples, and I’m just having to concentrate so hard to work out where the kick should come in. Then as soon as you bring it in, it locks everything together. That’s a joy.</p>\n<p><strong>What can you tell us about your new EP, ‘Way Too Much Time’?</strong></p>\n<p>I wanted to make some weirder dancefloor stuff. I’m trying to explore my set-up and find the sounds that you couldn’t easily make with a computer. So I made some records that use prime numbers (1, 2, 3, 5 and 7) per cycle. Like for this track ‘Escaped Clank Replicator’, which is 5 against 7 against 3 time. It’s super wonky. There’s also a track on there called ‘Protest Dub’ that is a bit more spacey and dubby but in 3 against 4 time. An artist called Tom Richards also made me this optical trigger so I can make records with white squares on and the reader uses the visual cue to create rhythmical patterns. The title comes from a comment on the mechanical techno video that went viral, classic ‘this guy’s got way too much time on his hands’ remark.</p>\n<p><strong>I feel like the danceability of your music is often missed, have you ever played in more of a club environment?</strong></p>\n<p>That’s the point of what I do at the end of the day. It’s meant to be fun. I played at this squatted caravan park rave in South Germany once. It was the only place I’ve performed where they asked me what BPM I would play, because that determined how late in the night you would be on. I’d like to do more of that stuff to be honest. I like to get people dancing. I prefer to play in the middle of the room for that reason. I don’t want to feel disassociated from the audience. To be honest, I don’t really feel like I’m performing. I’m busy trying not to fuck up. It’s the machine that’s doing all the performance.</p>\n<p><em>Graham Dunning will perform alongside Ewa Justka, Dane Law amongst many others on Thursday 22nd March.

    "content": "<p>Malmö-based experimental music festival Intonal continues to push the boundaries of expectation with the announcement of the final wave of acts for this year’s edition in late April.</p>\n<p>Deena Abdelwahed, who released the beguiling fusion of futurist club music and Middle Eastern tonalities ‘Klabb’ on French label Infiné last year, will perform on Friday 27 April at Inkonst. Additionally, Austrian avant-guitarist Fennesz, Morphine label boss Rabih Beaini and Jamaican dancehall duo Equiknoxx will also be joining the bill for Intonal, which runs from 25 to 30 April. Comprising Gavsborg and Time Cow, plus collaborators such as Shanique Marie, Bobby Blackbird and Kemikal Splash, Equiknoxx released the <em>Colon Man</em> LP late last year, a convention-defying exploration into stuttered bass-heavy dancehall. The group’s distinctly leftfield electronic take on a range of Caribbean styles has seen them booked at festivals such as Unsound and attracted remix treatment from Hardwax founder Mark Ernestus.</p>\n<p>Intonal have also revealed further details about previously announced acts, revealing that Pan Daijing and Group A have both developed their performances specifically for this year’s Intonal. Andreas Tilliander has also unveiled his plans to close the festival with a “six hours sleeping concert” entitled ‘Slumbering Sounds and Drowsy Drones’, which will see him “live-tweaking” sounds composed with the aid of random generators.</p>\n<p>For tickets or learn more about the festival, visit the <a href=\"http://www.intonalfestival.com/\">Intonal website</a>.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xBcX2lDXCo4?rel=0&controls=0&showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>A caldera is a volcanic crater formed after an eruption of magma; a scar left on the earth after one of the planet’s most dramatic natural processes. It’s a bold title to give any artistic project, and German producer Malte Schumann has certainly risen to the challenge. He counts the likes of Jan Jelinek, Martyn and Flying Lotus as influences, crafting an expansive discography of everything from the ethereal, slow-motion dub-house he has released with labels like Sonic Moiré, through to the skippy, UK bass tinged work he has put out with labels like Edinburgh’s Cut Music.</p>\n<p>Last year Schumann released the ‘134% OK’ EP on WNCL Recordings, an oddball fusion of unhinged avant-house and discordant, lo-fi melodics. Asked about his developing relationship with the label, he reveals his first introduction to the South London label: “I bought my first WNCL record in 2013 - the ‘Krenshaw’ 12” by Bobby Champs. What grabbed my attention was the interesting drum work and sound design. It was at a time where I was starting to get more into techno, house and UK bass after a few years of playing drum and bass and dubstep.” Schumann contacted the label’s founder Bob Bhamra a few years later to share some of his own music and discuss the label. “I don’t really send out many demos and even though these initial tracks didn’t make a release on his label, I was impressed with how dedicated his feedback was. You could really tell that he took his time to listen and respond. I think everyone knows how much that’s worth as a small artist, and how frustrating it can be to send out demos. We kept in touch and at some point randomly met in person at the counter of Rye Wax in Peckham. He’s the nicest guy in South London! I’m sure people who’ve met him will agree, plus his organisational skills are 134% on point. I think it’s important to know the people you’re releasing with and be able to relate to them… It gets a bit lonely in this internet music world sometimes!”</p>\n<p>Originally from Duisburg, Germany, Schumann moved to Brighton in 2015, having seen the opportunity to finish a vocational training course in childcare he was undertaking. The UK music scene was an additional pull, playing an important role in his decision. He has stayed in Brighton since, but that’s not say there weren’t any cultural shocks to be had along the way. “I have to admit that I was a bit confused when I went out in Brighton for the first time and everyone was already drunk by about 8.00pm”, Malte comments when asked about the difference between the two countries in terms of club culture. “Maybe that’s more of a Brighton thing because of the big student population. What I miss most are clubs with more than just one or two floors - more than just a space to dance. An event can be such an important hub for community and creativity – I think the strict regulations in the UK make it difficult to cultivate that kind of vibe. In general though, I’ve never heard so much good music and met so many gifted musicians as in the UK.”</p>\n<p>Malte’s mix for us is comprised exclusively of material from Brighton-based producers. “I wanted a snapshot of the current state of the music scene and the people that surround me”, he says when asked about the mix. “It contains mostly friends of mine and people who are involved in the local electronic music scene here. During my first week living here I attended an event called ‘Wax Work’ which was about hanging out and playing short vinyl sets in a club or bar during the week. I met so many great people through that and it was a great hub for the local community. It still has a positive impact even though it’s not happening anymore. A lot of these connections are maintained through ‘Patterns’, where Charles Green, Circa 2000 and I all have residencies.”</p>\n<p>“I’ve also included some people that I haven’t met before – or only briefly – like Etch, Medrea, Jaime Read and Four Heads. Jaime Read has been producing house since the ’90s, Etch is one of Brighton’s (or even the UK’s?) finest break-slicers and Medrea is an amazing up-and-coming producer. Four Heads are involved in Brighton’s experimental/ambient/noise improv scene, which is actually surprisingly big. There is a monthly event called ‘Splitting the Atom’ with musicians performing experimental music all day at the Green Door Store. I always enjoy going there for a pint. There’s a visible community spirit.”</p>\n<p>###Tracklist\nQGB - And Then They Burst The Bubble [Unreleased] <br>\nCaldera - Untitled [Unreleased] <br>\nCharles Green - Gamma Rays [Four Triangles] <br>\nMetrist - Nos Ossos [Neighbourhood] <br>\nEtch - Synapse Cluster [Gully] <br>\nFour Heads - In The Tunnels (Onemancrimewave Mix) [Spirit of Gravity] <br>\nCirca 2000 - She Made Me Wait (Computer Club) <br>\nSDXN - Turtle Dove (Thru With Love) [Quietly Making Noise] <br>\nMedrea - Untitled 02 [Hokkaido Dance Club] <br>\nQGB - Morph Impossible [Forthcoming Present Tense] <br>\nCaldera - Untitled [Unreleased] <br>\nCaldera - Untitled [Unreleased] <br>\nCharles Green -  RDT #2 [Four Triangles] <br>\nJaime Read - Da breaks [Fragmented Records] <br>\nMedrea - Untitled [Hokkaido Dance Club] <br>\nQGB - Quivering Grumbling Braying [Forthcoming Present Tense] <br>\nNightwaif - Xmas1 (Version) [Unreleased] <br></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?feed=%2Fstraylandings%2F0086-caldera%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p>In 1992, Castlemorton Common Festival sparked a moral panic around illegal raves. What made it unique was both the scale (20,000-40,000 attendees over a full week, the biggest of its kind for a decade) and its visibility in the public eye. The police faced criticism from the local town for their ‘soft touch’. In fact, the police arrested over 50 people, 10 of whom were taken to court for public order offences. After pressure from the media around the growing ubiquity of illegal raves, Parliament passed the now notorious Criminal Justice and Public Order Act of 1994. This act made the unusual move to police music itself, banning parties that play, &quot;sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats”. The state used this legislation to criminalise raves on the basis of the music they played. It acted as a fatal blow for UK rave, from which it never really recovered.</p>\n<p>There were acts of musical protest that immortalised Parliament’s decision in 1994. The Prodigy’s ‘Their Law’ is a direct response to the bill, and Orbital's ‘Are We Here?’ single contains a ‘Criminal Justice Bill mix’ comprising four minutes of silence. Autechre mocked the wording of the bill with their <em>Anti EP</em>, written to be both rave-able and at the same time non-repetitive. The packaging of the CD wore a sticker with the following message:</p>\n<p><em>“Warning. 'Lost' and 'Djarum' contain repetitive beats. We advise you not to play these tracks if the Criminal Justice Bill becomes law. 'Flutter' has been programmed in such a way that no bars contain identical beats and can therefore be played under the proposed new law. However, we advise DJs to have a lawyer and a musicologist present at all times to confirm the non repetitive nature of the music in the event of police harassment.”</em></p>\n<p>There is something delicious about the idea that the contents of the CD could only be accessed by breaking the seal that the message was printed on. Finally, in The Streets’ ode to rave, ‘Weak Become Heroes’, Mike Skinner reads what sounds like a eulogy to mark the death of the good times: “Out of respect for Johnny Walker, Paul Oakenfold, Nicky Holloway, Danny Rampling and all the people who gave us these times. And to the government, I stick my middle finger up with regards to the Criminal Justice Bill.”</p>\n<p>There are recent echoes of rave and its antagonisms with the state. One of the most renowned and egregious examples of club policing comes from the world of grime. Form 696 was a necessary license to be submitted to the London Metropolitan Police 14 days in advance of an event in any of London’s 21 boroughs. The aim of the form was to, “identify and minimise any risk of serious violent crime happening”. Billed innocuously as a ‘Promotion Event Risk Assessment Form’, Form 696 is actually an exercise in racial profiling and social control. In its original incarnation, the form required promoters to specify the ethnic demographic of attendees, as well as the names, stage names, private addresses, and phone numbers of all performers. After pressure from high profile musicians, the police removed questions requesting information relating to race, but retained the highly <em>racialised</em> questions of genre.</p>\n<p>Nights listing grime, bashment, R&amp;B, garage and so on were highly targeted, shut down by police before they could begin due to ‘safety warnings’ and even ‘terrorism scares’. The same level of scrutiny was not applied to metal, punk or hardcore nights despite their notoriously frenetic live shows. This is the continuation of racist policing by other means. The form was supposedly scrapped at the end of last year, but many promoters have since stated that other forms fulfilling the same purpose have been used.</p>\n<p>There were two unintended consequences of Form 696 that inadvertently helped spread the popularity and influence of grime in the early years. First, the form was initially only required by London promoters. Grime thus moved outside the city and into other neighbourhoods, helping to spread the genre to new audiences. Form 696 also targeted shows which, “predominantly feature DJs or MCs performing to a recorded backing track”. In a sly attempt to sidestep the technicality of the wording, some promoters began hosting nights with instrumental grime. A new mutation of the original genre: grime without the ‘rime’.</p>\n<p>In the last few years, grime has finally become an accepted form of mainstream music, with drill music becoming the new Met scapegoat of choice. Despite their international success, groups like 67 are subjected to heavy police interference. In an interview with <a href=\"http://www.clashmusic.com/features/beautiful-south-67-and-ray-blk-on-their-london\">Clash</a>, Scribz explains that the police have tried to censor the band altogether, cancelling or postponing shows to make it near impossible to book tours. Scribz was even issued an ASBO banning him from making music, leading to a new mysterious masked member, ‘LD’, taking his place. In a move that mirrors MF Doom’s ‘super villain’ stage persona and the use of stand-in performers, Scribz now ‘ghostwrites’ for LD (although the distinction between the two remains ambiguous).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;...The anarchic spectre of UK rave may be back to haunt Europe once again...&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Earlier this month, the Metropolitan Police revealed that the number of illegal raves has nearly doubled, from 70 to 133, between 2016 and 2017. The Guardian reported that these unlicensed events, “ranged from a rave in Liverpool accessible only by an underground tunnel, to parties in a field in Berkshire and an industrial estate in West Sussex. Last year in Hounslow, 1,500 people descended on a closed-down Morrisons, set up sound systems and kept going until riot police stormed the venue.” The anarchic spectre of UK rave may be back to haunt Europe once again.</p>\n<p>Why have parties moved to fringe once more? The answer might be disappointingly simple. Last year, the London Mayoral Office announced that the city has lost 50% of its nightclubs and 40% of its live music venues over the past eight years. There are varied and interlinked reasons for this. There are economic catalysts: the unmanageable growth of London’s rent and falling wages in real terms. But these also have knock-on social effects. In central London, property developers are on a continual ‘cool-hunt’, transforming cultural hubs into plush glass monstrosities: ‘<a href=\"http://www.straylandings.co.uk/mixes/0071-towards-collapse\">luxury flats for luxury twats</a>’. The increased presence of these properties correlates with a rise in expensive noise-abatement notices. It is probably safe to assume, with the transformation of the Heygate Estate from social housing into holiday homes for foreign investors, that the days of Corsica Studios are numbered. Because wherever the icy net of property development draws tighter, nightlife dies.</p>\n<p>There is also the apparent unwillingness of millenials to ‘go out’. 18-34 year olds spend more of their weekends inside, and alcohol consumption amongst young people is at all-time low. People who don’t understand politics point to iPhones and narcissism as the cause. The argument goes that ‘young people’ are too self-obsessed and addicted to Netflix to live authentic, joyful lives. Rather than socialising, we would rather argue about gender politics on the Internet; we would rather binge box-sets than booze. Any young person living in London knows this is crap. The causes aren’t personal, they’re material. The spike in rent and student debt, alongside casualised employment and enfeebled trade unions mean that Millennials will be the first generation to wind up poorer than their parents. For some reason, Printwork’s eye-watering entry fees or the £5 pricetag for a bottle of beer take the charm out of an evening.</p>\n<p>Another issue is the increased securitisation of nightclubs, with humiliating and dehumanising processes to maintain ‘safety’. Two years ago, many celebrated the reopening of Farringdon’s fabric nightclub after it was forced to shut its doors following two drug-induced deaths inside. But the <a href=\"http://mixmag.net/read/fabric-to-re-open-news\">conditions of reopening</a> included increased CCTV surveillance and ‘covert surveillance’ within the club. Depending on how charitable you want to be here, the meaning of ‘covert surveillance’ could range from plain-clothed cops to G4S to just more bouncers on the dancefloor. At the heart of the capital city, fabric has always been close enough to the ugliness of modern commercial culture to be included within it. But the state won new concessions against the club: they won greater control and state regulation in exchange for the continuation of fabric’s name and legacy.</p>\n<p>The idea of the ‘state sanctioned’ club is an oddly modern one. Afterall, the counter-cultural nature of illegal raving is part of what gave it a rebellious allure in the first place. Amidst an intense culture of ecstacy, dubplates and pirate radio, illegal raves were both an act of indulgent hedonism and calculated defiance. The very ambiguity of purpose was part of what made raves transgressive in the first place. There was no real ‘point’ to it, but it felt good. To an outside observer, the rantings and ravings of pillheads and pirate radio MCs was a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. But to anyone on the inside, ‘in the know’, it was everything.</p>\n<p>Simon Reynolds wrote in <em>Energy Flash</em> that if raves had any purpose, it was to, “make of joy once more a crime against the state&quot;. By their very nature, raves were first and foremost criminal activity. They operated away from the proximities of power, offering a glimpse of self-determination and radical freedom. Whenever the state did try to intervene, ravers found creative and ingenious ways to circumvent it. Although seemingly ‘mindless’, raves nonetheless function as a psychological corrective, to minimise hierarchy and maximise freedom. This joy can only be found in opposition to the state, not alongside it.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p><em>Listen to our latest radio show on music and the state, with Dr. Monique Charles &amp; Hence Therefore <a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/radio/the-state-monique-charles-hence-therefore\">here</a>.</em></p>\n",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Laura Bemrose.</em></p>\n<p>The debut LP from AJA is long overdue. I had heard of her notorious live shows years before news of any ‘official’ release. Part of the reason for this is that her music, although clearly written and produced with meticulous detail, is nonetheless a live experience. Indeed rarely do electronics sound so <em>alive</em>. Although brutal and harsh in timbre, it’s clear that this music has a carnal intimacy to it. The shrieks and shudders of noise jump and twitch like muscle spasms. The sharp shifts in dynamic genuinely make my body respond in reflex. Listen to the new single from her upcoming record, ‘Tuck It, Tape It’, on full volume and try not to jolt upright involuntarily when it kicks in.</p>\n<p>AJA’s live performances also have a kind of psychoanalytic pull to them. Throughout the course of a show, she draws the audience deeper into their psyches. The cacophony of screams and noise bring (or force) to mind the return of childhood repressions. Fear, trauma and anxiety come to the fore in the safe enclosure of the stage. She even compares her live shows to witnessing childbirth. It’s unsurprising to me that lyrics are of secondary importance to AJA. Because her squeals and squarks are fundamentally <em>pre</em>-linguistic. They come from a place that is deeply embedded in the mind but rarely accessed. As with primal scream therapy, there is an understanding that no progress comes without some carefully controlled regress.</p>\n<p>But unlike a lot of the screamy noise power-electronics of today, AJA’s music is actually fun. Her theatrical costumes and shapeshifting visual persona have more in common with Marilyn Manson than Merzbow. This gives AJA’s sound a unique queer identity. It is like a drag performance pushed to the extremes. Queer art today often takes the body as its subject. With Arca's bulbous torsos and Lotic's twisted skeletons, the body becomes a metaphysical abstraction. The anatomical ambiguities and contorted limbs can reflect the psychological anguish of gender dysphoria, or the experimentalism of queer sexuality. AJA projects these themes through the lens of psychedelic noise. Her music is like biting into a lemon. Bright and glossy on the outside, but with a fleshy interior that tastes acidic, bitter, and sharp.</p>\n<p>In anticipation for her debut album on Opal Tapes, we spoke to AJA about gender, performance, and death metal.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/422286753&color=%23763961&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>When I was researching for this interview I thought there were two AJAs — the style of music you used to play is so far away from what you do now!</strong></p>\n<p>I started off making punk and experimental music when I was 16 and then when I was 18 I started an experimental project with a producer called Andrew Course and we made this really thrashy extreme music. It was like Crystal Castles on crack. That was my first taste of production. But after that I had this idea of trying to bring these punk roots into the mainstream. I was so sick of hearing the same old shit all the time. I was also really frustrated with how women were being represented, so I kind of subconsciously started trying to make music that was more commercially viable but with quite intricate production. But when I was writing pop music I was just always missing something. I was trying to be something that I’m just not. And it was when I saw Emptyset at Norberg festival that it all changed. I got back to England and cancelled all my shows, cancelled my EP release and got rid of everything. I wanted to completely start again from scratch.</p>\n<p><strong>What happened at Norberg?</strong></p>\n<p>Norberg festival spiritually reconnected me to experimental music and I just thought ‘what am I doing?’ So I moved to Berlin and joined a grindcore band called Batalj and just started learning to make harsh noise and power electronics. I was learning about hardware, synths, noise pedals. I had to reconnect to my roots and it was such a special time for me. I felt like a kid again, rediscovering a part of myself that was dormant for a while.</p>\n<p><strong>And I see you’re playing Norberg festival this year?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah - I guess that’s where it all started for me. I absolutely love Norberg festival. It’s the most inspirational live event I have ever attended. I did an early performance there that was basically just an improvised jam that ended up lasting hours. I love playing environments that are smaller and tight-knit. You know the audience are going to ‘get it’. It’s so nice to know that all your hardwork and vision will be received in the right way. Sometimes I play shows and I can tell I am going to be misunderstood.</p>\n<p><strong>I suppose your live sets are quite extreme and theatrical, so they’re naturally going to be quite polarising.</strong></p>\n<p>When I was in Berlin I tried to fit into that ‘female noise artist’ trope: no makeup, no costume, all in black. It’s kind of rare to see a noise artist in a bio queen/drag queen kind of look. So it took me a while to come out of my shell. I now collaborate with a costume designer called Lu La Loop. She makes individual costumes for me, depending on where I’m performing. I’m wearing a new costume for Norberg festival, for example. I also make my own acidic visuals, based on queer and drag influences, around gender and sexuality and so on. I love the combination of bright pink colours and obscure grotesque aesthetics with dark, dingy noise. That’s the juxtaposition I go for. I was super influenced by AIDS Wolf and Skin Graft Records for this - these female fronted artists who really didn’t give a fuck. I just want to get to the core of how I’m feeling; the core of whatever emotion I’m trying to process. I feel like the more open I am, the more the audience can sense that energy. Strange and magical things happen when you perform from this place within yourself. I want people to just lose their inhibitions and lose themselves in the performance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/803/41161256531_dff07eae79_b.jpg\" alt=\"vv\">\n<em>Photo by Simon Parfrement</em></p>\n<p><strong>There’s that track on your new album, ‘Tuck It/Tape It’. I guess there is something specifically queer, or drag, about your costume performances.</strong></p>\n<p>I feel as though Lucy [Lu La Loop] and I are interested in exploring what is ‘between’ gender. I definitely identify as female and I definitely bring lots of femininity to the costumes, but I really find the idea of ‘asexual being’ very interesting. The illustrations I do and all the whole visual component of my work stems from queer interests. I do feel quite passionately about supporting the LGBTQ+ community and I really enjoy playing in places which hold a safe-space policy around this.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you feel like your audience has changed, or become queerer, since you started using imagery and costumes?</strong></p>\n<p>To be honest, when I’m performing I don’t really see much [laughs]. I’m either hyperventilating or spinning around in a frantic circle. I’m usually on another planet so I can’t really comment [laughs].</p>\n<p><strong>I understand you have also done some workshops related specifically to gender too?</strong></p>\n<p>I started teaching workshops over a year ago on field recording manipulation, hardware, costumes and branding: the whole shabang. I was lucky enough to work with Huddersfield University for their Music, Gender and Identity course for a researcher called Liz Dobson. I taught a workshop of young girls, and it was amazing to be part of raising a generation of girls to have the confidence to produce and experiment, and not be intimidated by misogyny in the music industry. The girls were amazing, they were so switched on. I feel very passionately about trying to empower women, girls and non-binary people. To be honest, I’ve had some shitty experiences in music, and I want to lead with positivity and tell girls: you can do it, and it’s really fun.</p>\n<p><strong>I personally find the crowds at events with a good gender balance are way more fun anyway.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah I've played at festivals before where there’s like two women — it’s bizarre. But at Norberg they don’t really shout about how great they are with the gender balance, it just is. And that’s how it should be. I’m not that bothered about events that boast about being ‘50/50’ or whatever. It shouldn’t be a big deal. There’s so many fucking amazing female artists out there - bookers don’t have an excuse not to in my opinion. There’s no goddamn excuse anymore!</p>\n<p><strong>It strikes me that you have been performing and producing for a long time, if you’ll pardon my impatience, why has it taken this long for your first proper release?</strong></p>\n<p>I’ve been trying to find the right label for a long time. This album was finished about a year and a half ago, so a long time. Now I’m on Opal Tapes, I’ve been pinching myself every morning when I wake up [laughs]. I’m so happy to be with them. But the process of making this album has been quite tough to be honest. I’ve had so many people let me down and I’ve discovered things about labels that aren’t in line with my politics, so I’ve had to drop things. I just knew that I had to get this out, somehow. Plus I don’t really like contacting people, I just want to perform [laughs]. The album uses a mixture of field recordings, hardware and sample packs that I made myself. I was really inspired by Puce Mary, Samuel Kerridge, AIDS Wolf. I think that album is a subconscious expression.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RWkcFSHMcLo\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>Is it like a collection of live recordings, or more ‘written’ in a conventional sense?</strong></p>\n<p>It was very meticulously written. Every bar was taken into consideration. The whole album took two to three years to write. My live performances are about 90% improvised, but the album is more of a self-contained journey. It has its own story.</p>\n<p><strong>I love the singing on ‘Black Stain’. How do you relate to your voice when you perform?</strong></p>\n<p>I definitely see my voice as an instrument. I don’t do much singing live, I just open with some opera… [laughs]. I love processing my voice in a way that makes it like an instrument, especially when you tune it down and whack up the chorus. I use it more as a background sound, covered in delays and reverbs so it’s just a drone. A lot of my tracks don’t have lyrics actually, which I guess is quite unusual. I used to write lyrics but I’d never really stick to them and there’s something really magical thing that happens when I perform. I don’t really have to think and this sound comes out of my mouth [laughs]. It took me a while to accept that.</p>\n<p><strong>In an odd way, I feel like the use of vocals in that way is quite similar to death metal too.</strong></p>\n<p>I kind of grew up on metal so I really love a good scream [laughs]. I do scream a lot in my performances. I really honed my scream over time. When I went on tour with Batalj, we did 25 dates in a row and I was screaming every word. Luckily I can do it now without wrecking my throat. It’s quite satisfying. It’s really cathartic to release energy in that way.</p>\n<p><strong>There does seem to be something quite psychoanalytic about your music. It’s almost like witnessing an exorcism.</strong></p>\n<p>That’s exactly it really. It feels like I’m being exorcised sometimes. My shows are fucking intense. They’re like watching someone give birth. And you just have to deal with it. I found myself through making that brutal noise stuff, and the screaming really channeled the heart of everything I was dealing with then: childhood traumas and loads of negativity. Before I went on stage I used to think to myself, ‘OK, what do I want to deal with?’ I used to try and put myself back into a situation and kind of ‘relive’ it in a safe space, trying to express how I felt then through the performance. But that was a year and a half ago, and I’m kind of at peace with a lot of that stuff now. I used to get nervous thinking ‘how am I going to conjure up all this aggression if I’m no longer feeling it?’</p>\n<p>But I can see my sets going in a different direction now. I want them to be more more fun. I’m creating a virtual-reality experience at the moment with the University of Nottingham, with a kind of music video coming later in the year. I’m looking forward to reaching a different audience with that. The stuff I make now is still crazy and manic and noisey. It’s still like 160bpm wonky noisey techno with some fucking banshee whales or something over the top. But whether it’s aggression or pain or humour, there’s always going to be this manic ridiculousness to it. That’s just who I am.</p>\n<p><em>AJA's debut album will be released on May 2nd with <a href=\"http://opaltapes.com/\">Opal Tapes</a>.

The word 'research' is apt here because Taeggi, and Lumisokea's work more broadly with Koenraad Ecker, takes an holistic approach to sound.

    "content": "<p>Charlotte Bendiks' career has run a different track to most. In her late teens, she began organising events in her hometown of Tromsø, Norway. As well as putting on underground raves with co-conspirator Maximo [Graesse] under the name 'Moist', Bendiks was heavily involved in the development of Insomnia Festival. The Tromsø-based event has been running since 2002, pulling together an eclectic mix of talents from all over the world. Previous editions have seen the likes of Public Enemy, Apparat and Thomas Fehlmann booked, yet Insomnia are also keen to showcase Norway's homegrown talents, such as Biosphere, Lindstrøm and Röyksopp.</p>\n<p>Around 2010 however, Bendiks' own productions began to gain traction. As she made the transition to artist and DJ herself, labels like northern Norweigan powerhouse Love OD Communications and John Talabot's Hivern Discs began to take note, playing host to her bugged-out dancefloor jams. Most recently Cologne institution Cómeme put out 'Hidden Tracks'; blending silk-spun drum-machine workouts like 'Hjemme' or 'Kaia' with small hours mindbenders such as 'Moped Jacks'. Musically, Bendiks describes her releases as 'body music', and it's fair to say both her productions and DJ sets are delivered with a bump.</p>\n<p>At the end of the month, Bendiks will DJ at Malmö's Intonal Festival. In light of this, we caught up with her while she was in Berlin working together with collaborator Jon-Eirik Boska on a couple of upcoming live shows. Among other things, we discussed how her experience has changed transitioning from running events through to travelling as a DJ and artist, the arctic sound, and DJing fetish events...</p>\n<p><strong>What’s it like being booked at events having worked on things like Insomnia and Moist yourself?</strong></p>\n<p>One thing I noticed when I started travelling more as an artist - compared to when I used to travel as an industry guest - is that if I was invited to a meeting or to network as part of Insomnia I was invited to speak in meetings and have an opinion. As an artist I don’t really have to think at all… Now I feel more like a teenager again. When you are an artist you are there to play and create content. When you are an industry guest you are there to think and discuss and be part of meetings.</p>\n<p>I used to meet a lot of the people when I travelled as an industry guest - they were curators that had been musicians when they were starting their career. I went in the opposite direction. I started putting on shows and gigs and stuff when I was very young and then figured out I wanted to do more music.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/365292578&color=%2344444c&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I watched ’Northern Disco Lights’ the other night - do you feel connected to the lineage of that scene?</strong></p>\n<p>I feel very connected to the northern Norwegian scene, not so much the Bergen and Oslo scene. What they talk about in the film - this started way before I started making electronic music. Everybody in that film is like a generation before me somehow. Northern Norwegians like Mental Overdrive, Bjørn Torske and Biosphere were people I met when I was a teenager and started going out. I heard their music and had the chance to become friends because we come from a super small city, which was super inspiring.</p>\n<p>I felt very connected and I still do in some ways, but I also feel that like I’m kind of an outsider there somehow. Per [Martinsen] aka Mental Overdrive that put out my first two EPs also said that. He was like: “somehow you’re the only person that makes music like this in Norway, because the sound is quite different. The percussion isn’t the normal way to do it here in techno or disco”. Maybe that’s because I lived in Cologne and met the Cómeme crew and got inspired by their stuff. But Per also said that there was also some kind of arctic sound that he recognises in my music.</p>\n<p><strong>I wonder if people make the connection in retrospect. If they know your from Norway they make the link - if not maybe it doesn’t matter.</strong></p>\n<p>Per also put out some tracks from Boska. The first track he put out was called ‘Arrival’. It’s a very garagey, UK bass kind of track. When it was released, Juno Download’s summary was something like “Norway disco, Oslo, Prins Thomas, etc…” But then they described the track as something very different. It feels like people need to place you in some scene to categorise you, even if it doesn't really fit. In my case, many people think I am German because I lived in Cologne...</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/319381394&color=%2344444c&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I guess nowadays it makes even less sense because the internet means we are much less tied to our location - we can hear music from all over the world.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah nowadays, but when I started buying CDs and vinyls I was still living in Tromsø and not travelling as much as I do now. The internet wasn’t such a big influence on music when I was a teenager so in the end I felt disconnected and I felt isolated.</p>\n<p>I guess that part of the whole arctic sound - when you’re so remote as Tromsø - you <em>are</em> somehow an outsider. I was recently playing at a festival in Murmansk in arctic Russia. I was there with Mental Overdrive and another guy from the Tromsø scene, Third Attempt… We did a panel discussion and they were asking how they could grow the scene like we did in Tromsø.  Per said something like “dare to be different and personal”. Find your own sound that fits with who you are and where you are coming from, don't try to imitate the sound of big central European cities.</p>\n<p><strong>I’ve always liked Biosphere and I find it really interesting how directly linked the scenery is to his music because he was into mountaineering and that kind of thing.</strong></p>\n<p>It is. He’s a very outdoorsy kind of guy, he likes hiking and skiing and he does field recordings in the high mountains, so it is very location specific. His music was very influential on me when I started making electronic music.</p>\n<p>I remember one super early version of a track on my first EP called ‘Lofoten’ - before it was finished I played a version in a DJ set. A friend of mine asked if it was ‘Novelty Waves’ by Biosphere… I later told Geir [Jenssen] aka Biosphere - that I thought it was because of the bassline. He asked what synthesiser I used and I said I borrowed a friend’s Yamaha. It turned out he had the digital version of that synthesiser. I didn’t know how he’d made his music but obviously I was inspired by that.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/808/40362103155_0aa8216e57_b.jpg\" alt=\"q\"></p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell me a bit about your time in Cologne and linking up with the Cómeme crew?</strong></p>\n<p>I was in my early 20s. I was working with Insomnia and had just started DJing; it was before I’d started making music. I started travelling a little bit as a delegate for Insomnia and realised that I wanted to get out of this small, remote city and get some perspective. I was planning to go to Berlin like everyone else [laughs].</p>\n<p>At the time I was putting on illegal raves called 'Moist' together with my friend Maximo in Tromsø. Maximo had lived in Cologne in the '90s and was an old friend of many people in the Cologne music scene, including Matias Aguayo who runs Cómeme. I got to know many of these people because the c/o pop festival was doing projects together with Insomnia and I was attending the meetings in Cologne. Ralph Christoph from c/o pop then attended some meetings at Insomnia and at an afterparty where we all were hanging out together I decided to move to Cologne instead of Berlin, at about 5.00am... A couple of months later I was in Cologne.</p>\n<p><strong>You mentioned you put on nights like Moist… What were those early parties like and how does it work running underground parties in Norway? When someone mentions an illegal rave I instantly think of someone playing raggatek or something out in the woods off a motorway…</strong></p>\n<p>In Norway there really were no clubs for underground dance music. Tromsø is a city with lots of electronic music exported, but when we started Insomnia, the first year only 50 people came. It was always a rock and roll city so it was really hard to create an environment where you could experiment and play less-available dance music.</p>\n<p>We arranged it like a private party and sold tickets upfront so we had money to rent the soundsystem and everything. We worked with an art student and put on parties in the basement of what is basically an arts society building. They were really cool. They liked us and rented it to us super cheap. We also got good deals on soundsystems, but we spent lots of time and money on lights, projections and installations… I think half the parties we lost money because we spent so much money on the decorations [laughs].</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/165129619&color=%2344444c&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I saw you played at one of the Pornceptual nights in Berlin recently, do you take a different approach playing there to say, a festival like Dekmantel? How does the experience change?</strong></p>\n<p>Pornceptual is a very mixed crowd which is great. It is not really a music party, people dance but the main reason they are there is because it is a fetish event. I hadn’t been to any fetish events like that before.</p>\n<p>It’s a cute story as to how I got booked for it actually. In November I was working here in Berlin and I used a friend of mine’s studio. It’s near where Pornceptual have their photo studio and meeting rooms. They were sitting outside having meetings while I was working on music and they were just asking me who I was. The next day they were asking about my mixes and decided they wanted to book me. I would walk in on their meetings and they’d have naked people in the photo studios [laughs].</p>\n<p>I was curious to see these parties. I’m not the kind of person who would have public sex or get naked in public, but I really appreciated that people that wanted to do that could, without judgement and in a safe space. They have very strict rules on how to behave and how to respect other people. I felt very safe there. I walked around and the vibe there is very free and liberal. I tried to work on that in my set and build some sexual tension. DJing is a very sexual experience anyway because you’re trying to move people - have them respond to you and find out how you can push them further. It’s a pretty physical and sexual experience - moving your body and being emotional. I felt like I fit in really well there.</p>\n<p><strong>What is next on the horizon?</strong></p>\n<p>I have this workshop which I am very excited about doing as an uneducated idiot [laughs]. I feel nervous about it but I’m also very excited about teaching and showing my methods. I think I will learn a lot from that. I’m also working on an art project which will be showing at Insomnia this year. I was hired by a curator working for the municipality of Tromsø; they have six sound artists creating art for public spaces.</p>\n<p>I’m also going to Nuits Sonores in May… They are part of this content sharing thing called We Are Europe. They ask some of the artists that are part of the festival to deliver a podcast. It could be a DJ mix, it could be field recordings, it could be a joke or your family’s cheesecake recipe… I’m going to start putting that together when I finish the workshop in April. I want to do a radio podcast with some unreleased tracks of friends and also interviews with friends from northern Norway. I think it’s going to be strange. Probably half the people listening to it will think I’m crazy or won’t get it. It’s all about being playful and daring to be personal…</p>\n<p><em>Catch Charlotte Bendiks on Saturday 26 April at <a href=\"http://www.intonalfestival.com/\">Intonal Festival</a> in Malmö.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"325\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/L9JPM6q_FmY?rel=0&controls=0&showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Arikon is the solo project of Berlin-based percussionist and producer, Arik Hayut. Readers of Stray Landings may recognise the name from his 'doom-tech' project, <a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/mixes/0052\">Gainstage</a>, with Pierce Warneke. Arikon's debut release, <em>The Prophet's Blood is Boiling</em>, is inspired by the 'beasts of holiness': mythological monsters that appear in the Hebrew Bible and Jewish Apocrypha. This historical context should give you some sense of the mood on this album. This is a serious, grand record.</p>\n<p>The cover artwork also gives a clue as to its sound. Inspired by Baroque painting, the cover of <em>The Prophet's...</em> presents a bowl of rotting fruit. Following a serious health-scare in 2004, and a very gradual recovery, Hayut has focused his work on concepts of time, decay and death. This is music back from the abyss. In anticipation for his latest release, we caught up with Hayut to talk about the shows that he remembers best, for better or worse...</p>\n<p>###The Young Gods,  London _ 1989</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/785/39538748680_d94e5ac8d2_h.jpg\" alt=\"x\"></p>\n<p>I was living in London as an art student at the time. The ‘New Musical Express’ magazine chose the debut album of an unknown Swiss band as album of the year 1989.  I bought it, played it extensively, and immediately fell in love with the trio’s unique sound concept – samples, drums &amp; vocal.  Their London gig that year took place at a big pub in Hammersmith, and was fully packed.  I stood in front of the tiny triangular stage at the corner of the pub, which was inhabited by a huge Akai sampler-keyboard, a drum kit and a microphone stand.  For that time, it was a very unusual  set-up.  When the Young Gods finally appeared on this little platform, they managed to transform it with their output and presence into a huge stadium stage. Imaginative and rhythmic, very original use of sampling, combined with killer idiosyncratic drum-beats, and a singer/front man Bono could only have dreamt of becoming.</p>\n<p>The power and energy that this trio generated at this point in time, nearly thirty years ago,  was simply overwhelming.  The atmosphere in the pub was gritty and hard, rough and sweaty. At a certain point a man carrying a fainted woman, shouting “out of the way!”, rushed his way through the mass towards the door. It felt like a war-zone.  I remember noticing a paddle of thick red liquid on the bar surface, which looked like blood.  Since I don’t react so well to the sight of blood, I needed to go out for some fresh air, but after a very short while on the pavement, I was simply drawn back in by that amazing sound.  One of the best gigs ever, and a huge influence.</p>\n<p>###Edu Delgado Lopez and myself, Berlin _ 1998</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/792/40452128545_eb79bf451a.jpg\" alt=\"xx\"></p>\n<p>One of my first collaborations in Berlin was with bass player &amp; DJ, Edu Delgado Lopez (Caspar Broetzmann Massaker).  Before we formed our band ‘Monoblock’, we used to play as a duo at weird parties in the strangest locations – of which there was plenty of in late-nineties Berlin. Edu was on the turntables, and I was playing a Wavedrum (the original electronic drum by Korg) with effects, in that set-up we reached some pretty ecstatic moments together.</p>\n<p>When it comes to gigs where the groove is the main thing, I have a habit of observing the audience from the stage, and tuning in on one person - meaning that this person would become my barometer for the ‘grooviness’ of the occasion.  Through the body language and generated aura of that selected person I can read the situation and direct my playing accordingly – push the beat, hold it back, drop out, etc. I simply let my energetic field connect to someone else’s.\nOn one occasion, we played an all-nighter in a pretty scruffy club called ‘Gartenhaus’, located at the end of a huge backyard behind the old legendary ‘Tacheles’. Neither of these places exist anymore.</p>\n<p>I remember the atmosphere being quite heavy that night. Most audience members seemed to be very high on a wide variety of substances, whereas the situation on stage was not that different.  Then, soon after we started playing,  I saw him, and immediately recognized my ‘groove-barometer’ for that evening – a really big muscled young man, bold head, Ray Ban shades, black bomber jacket, army boots with white laces, tattoos on his forehead, robotic movement.   It was clear to me, that had we met in any other situation, things may have not been so friendly, or simply put – this guy was pretty scary...  At a certain point he was dancing ecstatically in frenzy just in front of the small stage on which I was playing.  We were staring at each other, and it was clear we were feeding one another with energy. I was experiencing a state of trance with a Nazi. Not necessarily a pleasant experience, but most definitely a memorable one.</p>\n<p>###Self-Built Percussion Solo, Hong Kong _ 2000</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/794/39538748840_1c1037a655_z.jpg\" alt=\"xxx\"></p>\n<p>I was invited to play a self-built-percussion solo as apart of an exchange festival between Berlin and Hong Kong. It was an open air stage located on a huge parking lot, beneath the sky scrappers of the Bank of China. The organization was quite messy though, the technical crew did not really speak English, but all was done with a good spirit.</p>\n<p>The sound-check was long and complicated, the micing of the set-up was important for the instruments to sound good. After it was over, I repeatedly emphasized to the sound engineer how important it is that the microphones remain exactly where they are, and the mixer settings kept. He reassured me that nothing will be moved until the concert, a few hours later. Alas, later that evening, when back on stage, in front of  an audience filled parking lot, I felt that something was not right.  Only after starting to  play, had I noticed that a microphone placed above a big mounted bass drum, was completely off, about a whole meter away from it’s original position at the sound-check. Then I looked up, just to realize the two overhead microphones where not even mounted, there were only stands. It became clear to me, that the long, painstaking sound-check was in vain, and what came out of the PA was very far from what it needed to be.  I got so mad, that I stopped playing, went off stage,  through the audience towards the soundman. “What the fuck is happening? Where are the mic’s?  Fix this NOW!!” I yelled at him.  The guy looked at me, at first clearly disturbed by my rage, but then he simply smiled, nodded his head with both thumbs up and said in a profound Cantonese accent:  “Yes, yes, very good!”</p>\n<p>The audience mistook this rather awkward event for a gag, some even started laughing, when I was close to crying.  At the same time, this was a moment of enlightenment: ‘screw the mic’s, fuck the sound, it’s all about energy’ – so I thought to myself, went back on stage and just beat the hell out of my plastic pipes, metal sheets and bass drum with full intention.  It turned out to be a good gig after all.</p>\n<p>###Scenic Panner, Linz _ 2007</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/787/39538749080_30320f8761_z.jpg\" alt=\"xxxx\"></p>\n<p>Scenic Panner was a live A/V performance, which I was a part of. The idea - developed by programmer Urs Hoffer and video artist Stefan Bischoff – was MIDI triggering of urban images through live playing of acoustic instruments. I had triggers on my small drum-kit, generating midi-signals, so did the other musician, Jayrope, through his guitar. The result was an ever-changing landscape, as one sees through a window of a moving train, only these landscapes were sometimes rather absurd.</p>\n<p>We played for the opening evening of Ars Electronica 2007 - however the memorable experience from that occasion was not the gig itself, but one of the sound installations on the festival’s program I witnessed the next day. It was an ‘audiowalk’ through nature and a small neighborhood which was built on the ruins of the former Gusen concentration camp.  Participants would receive an mp3 player and headphones, and simply follow the instructions as of where to go at their own pace, while listening to descriptions and facts about the premises as well as survivors’ memories in their own voices.</p>\n<p>It was a grey chilly day, and walking the main street, amidst the little renovated family houses, the land upon which they were built was sold for a rather moderate price during the sixties - the same soil which witnessed sheer horror some 60 years before - that was a bewitchingly strong and eerie experience.  The colorful silence of nature, a train passing by, mixed with dry instructions and vivid recollections of horrific moments in the past, contributed to a rare sensation of past and present over blending into one another. One of the best sound-art events I had ever experienced. More details <a href=\"http://audiowalk.gusen.org/index.php?id=24&amp;L=1\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>###Swans, Berlin _ 2013</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/813/40452129375_71be36de55_h.jpg\" alt=\"xxxxx\"></p>\n<p>It was a time when Pierce Warnecke and myself were busy in the studio, working on a track of our ‘Gainstage’ project. I had tickets for the gig, so after a long day in the studio we headed to see and hear Swans. When we arrived at the beautiful Volksbuehne the show had already started, and since it was completely packed, we ended up standing just beneath the stage (yes, with earplugs, I admit…).</p>\n<p>The amount of energy, volume  and power this band generates is simply astonishing.  Both Pierce and myself where so charged and excited after the gig, that we decided to dedicate our project - which was mostly electronic until that point - to live tracks of  drums and electronics.  The result was our <a href=\"https://portals-editions.bandcamp.com/album/prtls002-gainstage\">debut LP</a> release on Portals Editions in 2015, ‘Gainstage’, which was created under a direct influence of that gig.</p>\n<p><em>Arikon's new LP, 'The Prophet’s Blood is Boiling', is out 13th April, with <a href=\"https://portals-editions.bandcamp.com/album/arikon-the-prophets-blood-is-boiling\">Portals Editions</a>.</em></p>\n",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Richard Stow and Dizqo, generative processing by Spatial.</em></p>\n<p>Utilising everything from cardboard boxes to car engines, plastic bags to ventilators, Swiss artist Zimoun creates colossal sound sculptures from everyday detritus. His installations dominate the spaces they occupy, often impacting galleries architecturally, as well as sonically. These spatial considerations also characterise Leerraum, the record label Zimoun founded in 2003 with graphic designer Marc Beekhuis. Releases are often mixed in 5.1, and use ambisonic techniques to create ‘full-sphere surround sound’, including directing audio from above and below the listener.</p>\n<p>The label’s latest release from Matt Spendlove, aka Spatial, places the listener right in the centrifuge, with DNA-altering vibrations directed from every angle. <em>Ombrion (5.1)</em> came together after Zimoun caught a Spatial live show at Montreal’s Mutek festival, after which Spendlove live-coded the piece using Tidal Cycles, later mixing it at London’s Call &amp; Response studio using a 14.1 speaker array.</p>\n<p>Almost akin to a heavily drawn out dub-mix, the album sees elements drift in and out of consciousness, crafting narratives from a web of seafloor drones and feathered acousmatic timbres. Spendlove straddles the line between regimented sonic purism and more flagrant, FAX-style ambient sensibilities. Crystalline low-end vibrations are offset by static crackles, itching sonar pulses and muted hoover sounds. As <em>Ombrion (5.1)</em> builds to a close, strings chime boldly, finding clarity as Spendlove’s cacophony of natural sounds reduces to a simmer.</p>\n<p>His last album, <em>A Music Of Sound Systems</em>, was an homage to UK bass culture of all variations. This may make him seem an unusual fit for a platform intended for ‘creative exchange among artists, designers, architects’. However, Spendlove has proved himself a versatile artist – one interested in the physicality of sound and its ability to affect environments, which is perhaps the common thread between an album evoking sound system nostalgia and <em>Ombrion (5.1)</em>.</p>\n<p>Stream the release on the <a href=\"http://www.leerraum.ch/\">Leerraum website</a>.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Uwe Schmidt has many alternate identities. So much so, there are projects I've come across without even knowing it's him. There's been latino fusion covers as Señor Coconut, psychotropic ambient oddities with Tetsu Inoue as DATacide, glossy downtempo lounge musing as Erik Satin and countless others. Currently, he is best known as Atom™, a name under which he has consolidated his archive.</p>\n<p>Schmidt grew up in Frankfurt, Germany, entering the world of music in the early 1980s, switching from drum kit to drum machine after hearing a Linn Drum on the radio for the first time. Producing work influenced by the emerging techno and trance scenes, he developed a partnership with Peter Kuhlmann (better known as Pete Namlook), putting out early works on the legendary FAX (or FAX +49-69/450464 for the pedants among you).</p>\n<p>He also set up his own FAX subsidiary, Rather Interesting, in 1994. The label acted primarily as an outlet for Schmidt's own productions, allowing him to experiment with a plethora of different genres, from glitch to Latin America-inspired electronica. Schmidt's relationship with Latin America deepened upon his relocation to Chile in 1997, a move he made in an attempt to isolate himself from the increasingly marketable electronic music scenes consolidating themselves in Europe.</p>\n<p>Following Kuhlmann's sad passing in 2012, Rather Interesting closed after 18 years of operations. Schmidt created a new label with Andre Ruello aka Material Object, another collaborator of Kuhlmann's, a couple of year's later under the name 'No.'. The imprint's aim is to remain 'independent from classification'; most recently releasing <em>Intrication</em> from France Jobin, an album inspired by the reactions of subatomic particles.</p>\n<p>We caught up with Schmidt to discuss the founding of No., his relocation to Chile and the unstoppable march of Western pop...</p>\n<p><strong>Tell me a bit about how ‘No.’ came to be… How did you first meet Material Object and what made you want to start a label together?</strong></p>\n<p>I got to know Andre while he was doing artwork for Pete Namlook's FAX label. We were in touch very briefly through email, exchanging ideas about artwork - nothing special really. Every couple of years he would send me some pictures of what he was doing, or he would say hello.  I hadn’t really met him, and in those days he was actually much closer to Pete than I was. We kept working together me and Peter but we weren’t really talking much. Everyone was busy doing their own thing I would say.</p>\n<p>When Peter died, Andre was the person who told me - he notified me that morning. He was the only link really, between me and Peter I would say. I think without Andre no one would have told me that quickly. That kind of bound us together a little bit, in that moment. We kept talking about things related to Pete - very practical things like who was in charge of certain things. Aside from being friends I was doing business with Peter. It’s like a second level to when somebody dies - suddenly you have business considerations. I had to figure things out on that level. It’s a little bit odd - when somebody dies you don’t want to think about that stuff but at some point you have to. Andre had a little bit more insight into that side of things.</p>\n<p>We met a couple of times in Berlin and a few other places. We both felt like it would be good to create a platform that would be a place for a certain type of music that we felt didn’t really exist. It’s not necessarily an ambient label I would say, we wanted to create a platform where we could put out stuff we liked independent from styles or classifications.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/221114234&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>In the bio on your website, there are a lot of bankrupt labels mentioned along the way (such as Mille Plateaux). Have you learnt lessons from the mistakes of others so to speak?</strong></p>\n<p>Not really. A lot has changed since I started making music up until today, especially on the business side. I would say it’s completely incomparable to what is going on today as compared to five or ten years ago. That said, I think there is a lot you can learn from that - everything is in flux. On a personal level there are definitely things I have learnt. It’s more about with whom I want to work.</p>\n<p>One of the things I told Andre is that I'm not interested in bureaucracy. I really want to see No. as a musical endeavour. I don’t like to think about music as a product and all that. I want to make music and release it without a big fuss, without all the promotion and business considerations which leave a strange aftertaste I think. You make music and then it suddenly turns into a product. Of course you have to do it to a certain degree, but I really didn’t want the operation to be transformed into just that. Often when you do a label you suddenly become like a banker or something. You’re not really thinking about music anymore you’re thinking about other things.</p>\n<p><strong>You mentioned earlier that you might not have heard about Pete’s passing if it wasn’t for Andre. Do you really feel that cut off from that world living in Santiago?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah I think so. Pete wasn’t a friend I was in touch with on a daily basis and we didn’t share much of a common group of friends. There were a couple of people like Andre and David Moufang [Move D] who I know, but we weren’t involved that much. There weren’t many direct links.</p>\n<p>Living in Chile, I’m not reading the press, I don’t watch TV… I try not to consume any external media as much as possible. If something really important happens in the world of course I’ll receive it, but maybe a day later or something. In the case of Pete, I think someone would have told me, but it would have been a few days later and through a very indirect route.</p>\n<p>I’m working hard on my isolation. With all the positive things about the internet, it’s also brought information closer to me; I think it’s way too close. I don’t like that part of being connected. When I moved to Chile it was slightly pre-internet. Not many people had it. A year or two after, the connection happened but when I moved here communication came through phone calls or sending faxes or letters.</p>\n<p>In that sense I don’t really see myself as being part of some kind of scene in terms of music. Those discourses in terms of genres I found them more of a problem than a solution. I find staying neutral and working on your own ideas much more useful than having to deal with other people’s ideas. The fatal thing with an idea, is that once it is in your head you can’t get rid of it. Even neglecting or rejecting it becomes a thing.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"325\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/twGkc-pYV6Q?rel=0&controls=0&showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>It struck me there are many parts of the world you could isolate yourself in. What has kept you in Santiago all these years? What do you like about living there?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, Chile is physically really far away from everything so the mentality of the people is different. I always say it’s like an island mentality - people are really isolated. They have been isolated both historically and physically for a very long time. When you are here, you feel like people aren’t really connected. If you live in other parts of South America, even Argentina for example which is just around the corner, they are much more connected to Europe. In architecture - how they build their cities - the things they talk about and how they see themselves. With Chile it’s a little bit different.</p>\n<p>When I first came here there was no connection to the outside world possible really. Being a foreigners was something rather new. People would look at you in the streets because you look different.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/797/27575506718_c01e31ddc6_b.jpg\" alt=\"as\"></p>\n<p><em>Atom™ at Decibel Festival, 2011.</em></p>\n<p><strong>You moved there in 1997, at which point Pinochet would have still been leader of the Chilean army (just). I’m guessing you must have seen a lot of change politically.</strong></p>\n<p>I think he was gone by the time I got there but you could still feel that and you still can today. It was much more isolated in that sense. When Tetsu [Inoue] came here in 1999, he was walking around the neighbourhood and someone shouted ‘chino’ out their car, which doesn’t actually mean Chinese - Chilean people call anyone Asian 'chino'. He was really offended because as a Japanese person he thought it wasn’t nice to call him Chinese. But he stood out as an Asian tourist.</p>\n<p>It has changed quite a bit, I don’t think that would necessarily happen today. When I came here - people would honk their horn at me and want to talk. You would have weird experiences on the streets. I liked that at the same time and found it very inspiring to be disconnected. In that sense when you said there are many places where you can be disconnected - I’m not so sure. The world is big and there are many places you could cut yourself off - certainly if I moved to central Africa I would be isolated… I was looking for a certain balance between isolation and being able to do my thing. Being far away but not on the moon or something [laughs].</p>\n<p><strong>I am a big fan of your Datacide project. I read you recorded the first album stopping off on New York on your way back from Costa Rica. How did you and Tetsu first meet and how long did that particular album take to make?</strong></p>\n<p>That album was recorded really quickly at his apartment in New York and partly at my place in Frankfurt. Tetsu was a friend of Station Rose - an artist couple from Vienna. I was supposed to produce an EP for them in my studio in ‘91 I think. Tetsu was friends with them. I found out he was making music as well and we decided to work on a track together. On Station Rose’s first EP there’s some bits of Tetsu on it.</p>\n<p>When I went to Costa Rica I asked him if I could come over to stay for a couple of days. That’s when we did the first album. It was done really intuitively I would say, not much planning. I was very much into hard techno but also ambient and more obscure derivatives. We both got much more interested in abstract electronic music and the albums after that we recorded in Frankfurt. We became close friends and talked a lot on the phone.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Ondas</em> struck me as a particularly interesting listen - can you tell me a bit about the recording process? There’s lots of avant-garde sort of interludes (like the lip trumpet solo, recordings of footsteps etc). Was the approach different to DATacide I/II?</strong></p>\n<p>I think both Tetsu and myself were trying not to repeat ourselves. When working on something we would have a brief talk before the recording; we realised we were really in sync with each other.</p>\n<p>It was the same case with <em>Ondas</em>. It wasn’t really a concept, but we were both interested in things that happen when you are tripping - we were trying to extract those experiences into  an audible scenario. We were always interested in how to go from one scene to the next. Suddenly we both got really fixated on those really harsh cuts that happen when you’re on acid. When you’re totally into one thing and then it flips - like you’re flipping a channel - you’re out of it and into something else.</p>\n<p>A lot of that information was stemming from trip memory - things that impressed both of us about the experience were very similar. We were certainly both interested in making ambient music trippier. The classic 'ambient sound' doesn’t have much to do with psychedelics - it’s more to do with Klaus Schulze and these people. We were interested in developing something different.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/18546707&color=%23343c3c&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Do you have a love hate relationship with pop? You do a lot of pop covers as Señor Coconut and as part of LB. At the same time there’s a lot of comments about the state of mainstream music in <em>HD</em>…</strong></p>\n<p>Well I really like <em>well done</em> pop music. The entire topic of what pop is I find an interesting phenomenon. There is music made for popular consumption which needs to be compatible with a massive amount of people. It has to resonate with the masses; in that sense it’s always a mirror to what’s going on. In that sense it’s a very complex system, it’s not only a mirror of the listener, it’s a mirror of the market because it’s a commercial enterprise; I wouldn’t even say it’s a necessarily musical enterprise.</p>\n<p>When something good is being produced I really like it. Currently though, I’m not very interested by what’s going on in the world in general, and this reflects into pop music as well. <em>HD</em> uses a pop format in order to make certain types of statements. If I tried to revisit that state of mind, I would say I’m a little bit bothered with the fact electronic music has turned into that kind of neutral, abstract zone of art that feels like it doesn’t have to comment on anything.</p>\n<p><strong>I’ve noticed how marketable it’s become in recent years. You see producers you consider as experimental now making music for adverts - it’s been kind of hijacked in that way...</strong></p>\n<p>With <em>HD</em> I was trying to open up a certain attitude being very aware of the difficulty of making any kind of statement nowadays. I was very aware of the contradictions within the work. I was more interested in making music that made a certain statement even if it wasn’t coherent - than not making a statement at all. I would perform the music live and someone wouldn’t like it. Someone would come up to me and say it was a really superficial way of seeing things. I liked that much more - being able to talk to someone about that.</p>\n<p>The word hijacked that you used describes it pretty well I think. I was looking back at - maybe ten years ago - many old things I had done. Very often when making music, I’m  perceived in relation to other stuff that surrounds me. Suddenly I realised I had to defend myself in a surrounding that had kind of hijacked me. I was thinking, what do I have to do with this? What is the relationship between what I’m doing and EDM let’s say?</p>\n<p><strong>You have that ‘Insulting the DJ’ track which seems to reflect a dissatisfaction with a lot of conventional club music.</strong></p>\n<p>Certainly. It’s weird - you start making something under a certain premise and slowly it gets infected by something else. You still like doing it but you are part of something different suddenly. You have to react to that. I sort of created my own world with things like Señor Coconut and then I realised after a while it would be nice to go back to things like ambient and techno.</p>\n<p>Techno has become such an industry and there are so many boring things being produced. I distanced myself from that because I didn’t like the surrounding. I didn’t like the idea that it had been ruined for me by something else though; with pop it’s a bit similar.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/18557381&color=%23343c3c&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>One of the things I’ve noticed doing music writing is how simple the story needs to be for writers and consumers. I did my dissertation on what most people know as ‘krautrock’ - it always struck me as a good example in that most of those bands didn’t know each other and they sound wildly different. But still the press had this impulse to try and band everything together.</strong></p>\n<p>I think this has always happened with music. There is always the impulse to bind everything together and give it a coherent analysis. I think the same same thing with punk. I only see a couple of bands doing similar things. Maybe you can say there is a common attitude but I don’t think punk existed as such. I often have problems with those classifications but at the same time find them very interesting. A lot of the things I was doing with Señor Coconut was playing around with genres; breaking them up and combining them. The classifications stop making so much sense.</p>\n<p>For someone who makes electronic music today, you are immediately classified into a genre. This happens every time I talk to young people who are starting to make music. Even before they have made a single tone, they know what they want to be, which is weird. “I want to be a D&amp;B artist”. It’s like, really?</p>\n<p><strong>I sometimes wonder what effect this has on localised music scenes - say things like gqom which are suddenly put in the media spotlight in Europe.</strong></p>\n<p>It’s a problem of course if a scene or a genre is being discovered and exploited because it necessarily means this scene becomes part of an economic timescale. Those timescales are getting shorter and shorter. If you remember at the beginning of the ‘90s there was a new hype every year. Someone would come up with 'bleep' or something, and then 'clunk'… The cycles became shorter and shorter until 15 or 20 years ago the cycles became so short that the whole operation became useless. Eventually everyone threw up their hands and admitted we don’t know what’s going on [laughs].</p>\n<p>I found that really positive. Finally they gave up! Now of course there is a certain appetite for new products. I’m not living in Europe so I don’t know what’s going on. The old scenes are exploited - how much movement can you generate? You burn those genres basically. When you, for example as an artist approach the media or a festival, there is this permanent attitude where they go “yeah but is this new?” You go “well I don’t know, it’s me. How new can I be after so many releases!”</p>\n<p>I always found that very disturbing. No one would go to you as a journalist and say why are you just asking me questions like in the old days - come up with a new kind of journalism... But for the artist you are constantly being asked to come up with something incredible every six months.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s also like - what’s the difference if something’s new or you’ve only just come across it?</strong></p>\n<p>Totally. My favourite example is Sun Ra. I always say that if Sun Ra had not been discovered by anybody when he was alive he would have just been a crazy somebody and nobody would give a shit. The fact that he was discovered and absorbed by free jazz and even people like Miles Davis - who transformed his ideas into something popular - he then in a retrospective way became somebody who was like ahead of something. But he wasn’t really ahead of anything, he was just being himself. In my opinion there is nothing really new or old about any artistic creation that is genuine.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/84120789&color=%23343c3c&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p>I think that pop has moved into its own realm a little bit. It’s come to that weird frozen place where everything sounds the same wherever you go on this planet.</p>\n<p><strong>It links to how ubiquitous the exportation of American culture has been. You can go to any country and buy a coke for example.</strong></p>\n<p>I was sitting in a cab in Khazakstan driving back to the airport at 5.00am on a Sunday or something. The guy has the radio on and it sounds like any pop music anywhere but sung in Russian. I really understood it and where it came from and how it was made. I could be in another cab somewhere totally different and the same song but slightly different would be playing. I find it interesting how electronic music does or doesn’t deal with that. I’m not saying when I started making electronic music it was political or anything, but it felt more daring maybe.</p>\n<p>I don’t know who said this, but there is a saying that the difference between art and design is that art is challenging. There’s nothing bad with design - everybody loves design, but it’s not art. Especially festivals who do 'avante-garde' art - very soon you realise if you talk to them their approach is not that daring. Often the entire enterprise is tied into that very comforting machinery which you can feed eternally with the same content more or less.</p>\n<p>Normally the problem is directed towards the artist. But the artist is totally embedded into a much bigger picture. As an artist you are being selected or rejected and it’s a very complex mechanism. I always see the problem being fed back to artist: ‘do something radical!’ I include media and journalism and festivals and venues and everything - they’re all playing along. It’s very easy from any perspective outside the creative one to throw the problem back to the artist.</p>\n<p>When the music industry problems started around 2007; when labels were going bankrupt, distributors were closing down and festivals were disappearing, there were many artist friends I had who stopped working. I was on a panel around that time and we were asked what should be done. It was the first time anyone asked the artist in the 20 years I’d been working. It’d never been a question and now it is - why is it me being asked? Suddenly no one knew what was going on. Suddenly this thing turned around.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/262197826&color=%23343c3c&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\"></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p>I guess it was only a matter of time until we had a trance revival. For whatever reason, I had always felt a shameful affinity towards the genre. It was almost too honest, too unashamedly passionate, to be worthy of 'serious' or 'proper' appreciation. The name itself, and many of the accompanying sub-genres (euphoric-, stadium-, and epic-trance), make no attempts to hide their intentions. They produce music of pure feeling. No degree of cynicism survives on these dance floors.</p>\n<p>But as with many genres of the 90s, trance has been recently abstracted into new, less familiar forms. Lorenzo Senni is one of the first names to mind here, but there are also echoes of this with TCF, Amnesia Scanner and Jesse Osborne-Lanthier. This music cherry-picks trance's sweetest fruit (the fuzzed-out synth pads, the building of ecstasy, the cavernous reverbs) and makes these features primary focus. There is a feeling that within this new context, away from the commercialism of Ibiza and Ministry of Sound, trance can be enjoyed 'guilt-free'.</p>\n<p>The latest release from nascent imprint Petrola 80, <em>Safe Following Distance</em>, is so called in reference to the growing ubiquity of internet surveillance and the death of privacy. But it could be also easily in reference to trance itself. As with Lorenzo Senni's '<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-INk1qkPEw\">Rave Voyeurism</a>', this EP is littered with uncanny sonic references to '90s euphoria. Listen to the pads on 'A Distance In Between' (<em>reach for the lasers!</em>) or the towering arpeggios that conclude 'New Partial Freedom'. But these are made from an epistemic distance, like watching a genre, a scene, or a party from afar.</p>\n<p><em>'Safe Following Distance' will be released on April 20th with <a href=\"https://petrola80.bandcamp.com/album/safe-following-distance\">Petrola 80</a> as a 12&quot; vinyl and digital download.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/430621740&color=%2364645c&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>",

The brainchild of artist Simon Coates, it set out to break the commerciality that had the UAE’s arts scene in a stranglehold, and as a place where like-minded individuals could take time away from the often-oppressive nature of Middle Eastern life.  Coates moved back to London in the summer of 2017 and registered Tse Tse Fly Middle East as a Community Interest with a remit of working with non-profit organisations and charities to highlight the social and political work they carry out.</p>\n<p>Now, <em>Tse Tse Fly Middle East</em> can be found in venues around London, producing live experimental arts events that feature curated films, and live sonic and visual performances. The platform is now home to a loose collective of artists and creatives, all of whom either have roots in the Middle East, Africa or the Indian subcontinent, or who weave strong sociopolitics into their practice.</p>\n<p><em>Tse Tse Fly..</em> can also be found online in the form of a monthly <a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/resonanceextra/playlists/tse-tse-fly/\">two-hour radio programme</a> for arts station Resonance EXTRA. The programme features sound art, noise and experimental music from the Middle East and surrounding regions, and is designed in part to confound the West’s expectations of music and noise made in areas that are often overlooked or disregarded. The monthly programme is also re-broadcast on radical Moscow-based web station New New World Radio.</p>\n<p>The mix that Coates has made for us is a distillation of the kind of music played on the Tse Tse Fly radio programme and reflects the sort of work that’s performed live by members of the Tse Tse Fly collective.

    "content": "<p>It has always frustrated me how often discussions of music become discussions of technology. You see it a lot on forums, with endless debate over the merits of this or that hardware. There is a sense in which, as a listener, you are expected to respectfully doff one's cap to the great machines of our era: 303, 808 and so on. The gear, I am told, <em>really</em> matters. That poor tunes are the product of poor tools. I’ve even heard that analogue sound has an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwXayHbUQ2o&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m54s\">objective superiority</a> because of its frequency range. This is meant to be the bread and butter of electronic music: a genre built on gear.</p>\n<p>I’m sure I am not alone in thinking that this is a dull way to approach music. For one thing, a lot of great music uses primitive technology. DIY punk, noise, hauntological ambient, hypnagogic pop and so on. It’s hard to imagine that Grouper, Daniel Johnson, Guided by Voices, Jandek, Boards of Canada, William Basinski or Harry Pussy would sound ‘better’ if only they had access to a plush studio and expensive equipment. Besides, there was a time when modern electronic music attempted to cleanse sound of its imperfections (tape hiss, vinyl pops). But now, some producers introduce those elements when they don’t occur naturally. You could call it 'retromania' or merely nostalgia. Clearly though, the alleged superiority of hardware and analogue is a judgement based in values, and values change.</p>\n<p>One producer that has been unfairly caricatured as a tech-fetishist is Caterina Barbieri. Last year, she released two staggering LPs: <em>Patterns of Consciousness</em> as a solo release and <em>Remote Sensing</em> as Punctum (with Carlo Maria). Her music creates pointillist landscapes: virtual environments from digital minutiae. These sounds are generated by some classic synths (the Buchla, 303, 606 and modulars), but these are merely tools for a larger artistic project. With both of these albums, ‘consciousness’ and the ‘senses’ are of extreme importance. <em>Patterns of Consciousness</em> in particular aims to emulate the way in which the mind wanders, veers and contradicts itself in thought. In short, this is music about psychology, not technology.</p>\n<p><em>Patterns...</em> also has an unusual structure. Although spanning seven distinct tracks, there are only five discrete pattern sequences. You’d be forgiven for not noticing this. Although comprised of an identical motif, the same pattern can carry very different emotional content. On the opening ‘This Causes Consciousness to Fracture’, the sequence sounds optimistic and driving; on its sibling track, ‘TCCTF’, the same pattern feels forlorn and dejected. On ‘Scratches on the Readable Surface’, the melody is cold and mechanical; on ‘SOTRS’, it is warm and organic. This A/B format works like two hands on a piano keyboard. Each pattern-type generates two tokens, working in opposition. One builds conflicts, the other resolves them. One reports, the other retorts.</p>\n<p>I’m not surprised that Barbieri comes from a classical background. After all, it’s this emphasis on <em>performance</em> that classical music is all about. Despite infinite admiration for the ‘great composers’, the real joy of classical comes from finding the best interpretations. Classical music nerds will argue endlessly over different recordings from different years and different conductors. The jury is still out on which Glenn Gould performance of the <em>Goldberg Variations</em> is best, for example. Artur Schnabel even said that he played the rests, if not the notes, better than any other pianist. The lesson from classical is that music’s formalism (its pitch, rhythm, instrumentation) can last hundreds of years, but can only offer so much. It's the ineffable qualities of performance (tempo, phrasing, timbre) that fade fastest in memory, but are often the most bliss-rich.</p>\n<p>This is the essence of Barbieri's music. The technology and formalism is secondary to its psychological character and textural nuance. Listen, for example, to how 'Gravity that Binds' evolves through its 16-minute course. It's all in the subtle phrasing and the dynamic arch. I couldn't care less what synth it was made on. This emphasis on psychology also encourages a cross pollination of influences. Barbieri studied Hindustani and minimalist composition in Bologna, and you can hear the breadth of her taste in her <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/caterinabarbieri/caterina-barbieri-x-nts\">latest mix for NTS</a>, interweaving Vivaldi, Lorenzo Senni, sludge metal and Bulgarian folk.</p>\n<p>Ahead of an exciting upcoming performance as part of Max Richter’s ‘Sound &amp; Visions’ residency alongside Colin Stetson, we caught up with Barbieri to talk Bach, La Monte Young and My Bloody Valentine.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/345202610&color=%236474bc&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>It strikes me that a lot of writing on your music is much too focused on its technical aspects — the synths, the patches and so on.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah it’s really annoying [laughs]. I really hate it. I guess I use a certain type of equipment that is very in vogue at the moment, and it attracts a certain demographic (usually men) that are super into tech. So they constantly keep asking the same questions about the gear I use. I also understand that the press have to latch onto something interesting, and since the equipment I use is kind of unusual or striking, then that becomes an easy talking point. They love to talk about a girl who plays modular synthesisers [laughs]. But my perception of music is much broader. I would love to talk about different things.</p>\n<p><strong>I guess it’s very easy to cover music that has a kind of ‘gimmick’ but it’s much more difficult to talk about things like the emotional content of music.</strong></p>\n<p>I think it’s getting worse and worse in the press these days. With the web, you always have to find a snappy sentence or captivating title to catch an audience. But then the focus tends to be very limited thereafter. Don’t get me wrong — I like talking about technology. But I like to do it holistically as a bigger part of my artistic project. I sometimes get the feeling that people think I am some kind of tech-fetishist, but I’m not at all! I’ve never read a manual in my life. It’s weird. It also makes it hard to break the loop. Journalists always ask me the same questions about my gear so I talk about it a lot, and then it becomes very associated with my name. You develop a history of yourself on the web, and it’s hard to change.</p>\n<p><strong>I suppose with electronic music, the role of the ‘artist’ has been kind of diminished. It's more about 'production' now.</strong></p>\n<p>Yes at times it can be almost humiliating. Because I want to talk about aesthetics, and emotion, and my thoughts on music! But the focus always comes back to the gear. I was even once asked to detail exactly what I do with my hands on stage [laughs].</p>\n<p><strong>Well the album is called <em>Patterns of Consciousness</em>, right? It shouldn’t be too hard for people to recognise that it’s got an important psychological element to it.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah! <em>Patterns of Consciousness</em> is all about the power of sound on consciousness and the psycho-acoustic affects of pattern-based operations in music. How sound can shape, expand and reconfigure spatio-temporal perceptions. I’ve emphasised this aspect a lot, for example in the liner notes for the album. But very few people dare to ask me about it! Maybe because it’s quite a complex topic and some people perceive it as vague. But for me it’s not. <em>Patterns of Consciousness</em> was very much about exploring sound as a medium to explore our own mechanisms of perception: how pattern and repetition in music can alter our perceptions. The technological aspect of the album is secondary, even if very present. It’s a tool to express those ideas.</p>\n<p><strong>Some of it is really emotional. I love ‘Gravity That Binds’ for that.</strong></p>\n<p>That’s a really emotional one. I initially didn’t want to include it on the album because it felt a little too emotional, too warm, too vulnerable. But it works as this long reflective ending, with this kind of cyclical temporality.  It also breaks the duality of the other pieces on the album: every other track as a slow or fast ‘version’ of the pattern but ‘Gravity That Binds’ is a standalone without a counterpart. It’s my least favourite piece in the album but it’s the track that people like the most in live performances [laughs]. <em>Patterns...</em> is a very emotional album in that sense too. There’s a lot of calculations, working with generative principles and so on, but it’s a record where I kind of opened myself a lot compared to previous work I have done. I wanna keep exploring this difficult balance of psychic, human, emotional thought and structured, organised, glacial form.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/946/26796555287_11c9117997_h.jpg\" alt=\"yas\"></p>\n<p><strong>There is an idea in music that songwriters ‘have an emotion’ and they then express that emotion through the music. But often it’s the other way around: you’ll start writing music and you will form an emotion out of that process.</strong></p>\n<p>That’s a very nice interpretation. And it’s true! When I work, it’s the process of creation that teases out a new flavour of feeling.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s amazing how music can introduce what feels like a new emotion. I felt like that the first time I heard My Bloody Valentine.</strong></p>\n<p>I actually discovered MBV during my first trip to London when I was like 15. I was at some summer school to learn English. At that time, it was still the golden age of CDs and they were much cheaper than in Italy. So I bought Loveless and it was such an enlightening experience. It was like some alien record. It has such a different perception of time and space. You can almost disappear into the sound. There’s a feeling of self-surrender to the wall of noise. That feeling of immersion in music was a big influence on me. When I was studying in Stockholm, I was in the same class as Ellen Arkbro. We were sitting next to each other one day and we were chatting about the new MBV album and that’s how we became friends [laughs].</p>\n<p><strong>Am I right in thinking Ellen sang on one of your records?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah she sings on the last track on my <em>Vertical</em> album. She’s pronouncing letters from the alphabet. It was a very weird collaboration [laughs]. Ellen has been doing beautiful music for many years and I was really happy when <em>For Organ &amp; Brass</em> came out. It’s an amazing record.</p>\n<p><strong>Have you thought about teaching your music to a larger ensemble?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah. I just wrote a piece for voices and electronics, which will probably be part of my next album. I wrote down scores for the singers and it was actually the first time I have really done that. It was a slow process. I was applying the same principles for the voices that I use for my synthesisers. So sometimes I was writing parts that are actually super difficult to perform. It’s a mix of written material and more oral, free-form instructions.</p>\n<p><strong>What made you want to start working with voice?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, I’m using the voice in kind of an abstract way. There’s no words, but it’s very structured. I wrote these very intricate patterns. It does kind of sound like a synthesiser — there’s lots of high-pitched stuff, super-fast lines with a lot of polyrhythmic ping-pong effects too. For example, I wrote a kind of monophonic melody but split it between two voices so it has this weird, jumping effect. So I suppose it sounds kind of mechanical, but it has a lot of emotional potency to it too.</p>\n<p>I’m also really influenced by baroque. I was doing a residency at the Bienalle in Venice and I had access to this harpsichord, and I wrote part of that piece on the harpsichord. A lot of it does sound totally like pure Baroque style, to be honest. I want to do a lot more of that kind of stuff in my future work. I just want to free myself from spatial, temporal restrictions. There are threads of influence that run all the way from Bach to modern electronic music, and I’m keen to uncover them. There’s going to be voices, harpsichords, synthesisers, electric guitars… you name it. I’m also very influenced by metal. I don’t give a fuck about stylistic boundaries [laughs].</p>\n<p><strong>Bach is my idol.</strong></p>\n<p>Mine too.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/395755665&color=%2364645c&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>How much of your classical training informs what you do now?</strong></p>\n<p>A lot, I think. I’m realising that more and more. For a few years, I took a break from classical music and started experimenting with electronics. There was a time when I thought I would never play classical guitar ever again. But you can’t escape your training. First of all, there are certain human qualities that classical training teaches you. For example, a certain sense of discipline and consistency and rigour. Classical training is tough and is constantly challenging. It forces you to have this deep connection with yourself, a sort of 'transparency'.You can’t bluff your way through a classical performance, you really have to become aware of your limits and learn how to overcome them.</p>\n<p><strong>I recently had this horrifying realisation that when you watch a classical virtuoso, you’re witnessing the fruits of a lifetime of hardship and discipline. A lot of those performers at the top of their game went through a lot of pain.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah that world is crazy. To become a good performer, you really have to nullify yourself in a way. You break yourself down and build yourself back up again.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of virtuosos, I see you’re playing with Colin Stetson soon in London.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah it’s at the Barbican, organised by Max Richter. He’s doing a series of nights called Sounds and Vision. I’m super excited because Colin Stetson made a big impact on me growing up. He inspired me to strive for writing original music on “conventional” instruments. He really developed a super personal, unique, unrepeatable way of playing an instrument, very handcrafted and soulful. When he plays he’s sharing his music but also his life. His music is him, his life. An approach that I find super inspiring.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally, I’m interested to hear your thoughts on meditation. Do you consider your sound ‘meditative’?</strong></p>\n<p>My <em>Vertical</em> album definitely is. It came out of my first experience with the Buchla, which really changed how I listen to sound, taking a ‘deep listening’ approach. So my first experience of meditation was through sound, focusing on microscopic elements of music. With deep listening, you start to lose the boundaries between inner and outer reality. It feels like you’re floating beyond the physical. At the time, I really needed drones to enter that kind of ‘deep listening’ mode. Drone music is great for that — it forces the listener to pay attention to sound in its microscopic qualities. The “poverty” of formal changes in drone music encourages a very active participation from the listener. But I wanted to branch away from drone and see if I could create meditative states with more pointillistic sounds, using repetition.</p>\n<p>Drone music, and the music I make, rarely has a definite beginning or end. This is actually influenced by an idea in Indian philosophy of sound. In this tradition, there are two kinds of sounds: Anahata Nada and Ahata Nada. Anahata Nada is literally ‘unstruck sound’, sound which doesn’t come from a gesture, it’s the sound of the universe, the eternal cosmic vibration. La Monte Young was in love with this concept, he even thought of it as a mathematical concept in the mind of God. Ahata Nada is a ‘struck sound’, a sound that is manifested physically, and which comes from a gesture. It’s close to the idea of a plucked string, for example.</p>\n<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about Anahata Nada in relation to a subtractive compositional design in my music. Another influential concept of Indian sound speculation for me is the approach to music as an organic, generative process, sound as an agent of creation and recreation (Nadabrahma). Music-making as a “coming into being”. This aspect is very important to me so I always try to define a personal generative grammar that is able to develop music in real time for the live performance. I start from a limited of values and then use some generative principles to expand the potential configurations of this values. It’s like a computational process, you define a bit of code, a closed system able to produce variation, a larger body of output. I like to turn these automatic processes into practice of creation.</p>\n<p><em>Caterina Barbieri will perform at the Barbican with Colin Stetson on 13th May at the Barbican.

    "content": "<p>The productions of Reba Fay, aka Swan Meat, are often disarmingly tranquil, given their placement in the frenetic, glitch-indebted sample mashup scenes frequented by the likes of PAN, Staycore and Bala Club. The Cologne-based artist has the rare ability to cram an album’s worth of ideas into a single two or three minute track without overcrowding the picture. In short, there is beauty among the chaos; melancholic choir vocals find their place nestled between staccato sound poems, sullen acoustic guitars riff their way between power-drill sound design, and whirling ambience and moments of psychedelic summer bliss prelude apocalyptic percussive workouts.</p>\n<p>Lately, however, these hints of a more meditative side to Fay’s productions have come into sharper focus. Her ‘Lathe of Heaven’ release, for example, centres on synthetic washes of ambience and delicate melodies, realised through the medium of MIDI string tonalities. There is a nostalgia to these sounds for anyone who grew up glued to their games console, and in fact Fay has taken direct inspiration from her own experience of role-playing games (RPG) for her most recent work.</p>\n<p>“Growing up shy, games were the ultimate social panacea”, she begins when asked about how this inspiration has translated into her productions. “Have a hard time looking your friends in the eye? It’s OK, we can just play <em>Soul Calibur II</em> together. Not only that, but games have always provided great and necessary escapism; across a variety of genres, the best games are exercises in the artful coming together of worlds: storytelling, music, theatre, empathy. I know I wasn’t the only kid who’d sprint home from school to play <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> and <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, who sought solace from the trauma of growing up in those games. However, it’s only recently that I’ve begun to realise how being so invested in gaming as a kid has impacted the way I write music and the way I’m drawn to certain motifs, sounds and harmonisations.”</p>\n<p>Currently, Fay is feeding these influences, alongside two short stories she wrote last year, into plans for a full-length release. “The thing still needs quite a bit of work”, she responds when we enquire further about the planned LP. “But I’m working on an album for which I’d like to see a vinyl release. Each side traces the narrative arcs, of [the] two short stories. Side A [will be] symphonic, with traces of that aforementioned RPG influence; side B being quite gloomy and percussive. It will come out at the end of the summer alongside a little book. ”</p>\n<p>Poetry was the intial reference point for the Swan Meat project, and although it has developed and altered over the years, it will still be just as intrinsic to Fay’s latest work. “So long as I continue writing, poetry will be woven into the songs I make”, she answers when asked about its place in the planned album. “However, over the past year most of what I’ve released wasn’t, I don’t think, structured around poetry and didn’t use poetry as [its] backbone. I’m having more fun this way – realising that my voice can come through in my production style sans that explicit link to my ‘fleshy’ body. In retrospect, I think I was hiding behind poems.”</p>\n<p>Fay’s contribution to our mix series gives a taste of her current influences and inspirations for the forthcoming album, from soundtracks to games like <em>Paladin's Quest</em>, <em>Clock Tower</em> or <em>Fatal Frame</em>, as well as soundtracks to films like <em>Under The Skin</em>  <em>Ringu</em> or John Carpenter's <em>The Fog</em>.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?light=1&feed=%2Fstraylandings%2F0088-swan-meat%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>On 5th May, Katsunori Sawa and Yuji Kondo will release their last EP together as Steven Porter. The project began around 2011, seeing the duo release everything from shunting excursions in dub-decay, through to doom-clouded early-hours thrillers on the likes of Weevil Neighbourhood and SNTS. Their final offering, the 'Reservoir' EP, is a Tesla-charged assault on the senses, utilising swollen low-end abstractions, apocalyptic kick drums and nuclear-fallout clouds of ambience to destructive intent.</p>\n<p>Speaking with us last week, Sawa stresses their collaboration is likely to continue in other forms. &quot;We still have unreleased tracks and will continue make music together&quot;, he begins. &quot;But we don't know about releasing more in the future... Steven Porter broke up at the end of 2017. There was no particular reason other that that we want to make music in a new colour. It is something natural. Me and Yuji will walk a new way from this year - there will be lots of releases over 2018.&quot;</p>\n<p>Sawa and Kondo first met at a gig Kondo was playing at, and the collaboration developed naturally from there. &quot;I was surprised about his music and recall that he played drone and noise sounds on stage&quot;, he recalls. &quot;It was a very simple story; I don't like 'band naming' so I gave the name Steven Porter.&quot;</p>\n<p>Sawa's mix for us deviates from the fear tactics they deploy in their own productions, presenting a cross-section of acousmatic experiments, aurora borealis pop and fog entombed synth anthems. &quot;No instant music, only real music in this mix&quot; he explains when asked about the influences behind it. &quot;I cannot describe it with words, just listen. Genre and age are not important here. I feel music was simple but has become complicated recently, in good and bad ways.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;In Japanese Kanji, 'music' is '音楽', 'sound' is '音' and 'enjoy' is '楽'.

    "content": "<p>Plunging dubstep, jungle and grime tropes into the digital brewers mill, ‘Trigger Finger’, the latest release on Haunter Records, is as affront as the title might suggest. The EP comes courtesy of Cairo-based Ahmed Al Ghazoly, aka Zuli, a producer already gaining notoriety for his data-moshed percussive abstractions and noise-caked half-steppers on Lee Gamble’s UIQ imprint.</p>\n<p>‘Trigger Finger’ finds appropriate footing on Haunter, a label oft frequented by a similar amalgamation of mangled drum n’ distortion workouts and Windows 99 nostalgia. The title track is pure dancefloor weaponry; HAL 9000 death throes leaving you in unsettled suspended space between viciously overdriven breaks and demolition-charge low-end. ‘Your Tracks Are Too Short’ meanwhile, leaves a metallic aftertaste. Taught, relay-baton rhythms buffet against stuttered full-fat kicks, itching overhead percussion and torpedoing drones.</p>\n<p>Despite their undoubted club-influence, Ghazoly’s productions enjoy subtlety in equal measure. ‘X3’ sounds like a cross between one of Fuck Buttons’ bitcrushed ambient epics and ultra-sparse Deep Medi-style swayers. ‘Everyday’ and ‘Ladies and Gentlemen’ also place emphasis on textural richness, samples kneaded and reshaped until they take on new forms entirely.</p>\n<p>Haunter Records have had a rather immaculate run of releases by any standards, yet ‘Trigger Finger’ stands out in particular. Ghazoly has added depth and dimension to an already formidable sonic palette, crafting a release both taught and unyielding, yet also syrupy and elastic.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/437414766&color=%23919191&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photos by Curt Lundberg.</em></p>\n<p>Malmö lies on the Swedish side of the Øresund bridge, which runs from Copenhagen in Denmark. My first impression was how tranquil and clean Malmö is, a far cry from the purposeful bustle of a city like London or Stockholm. The people here are relaxed and inquisitive, with a dry sense of humour not dissimilar to that of their neighbouring Danes.</p>\n<p>Malmö’s music scene is something I’ve taken an interest in for a number of years; and a key meeting of those strands of interest can be found at the annual Inkonst and Inter Arts Center-led Intonal Festival. Intonal is an enterprise backed by other similarly structured multi-venue electronic festivals like Unsound, Mutek and CTM. Behind this however, Intonal is the brainchild of Ulf Eriksson, perhaps best known for his role running off-kilter dub-techno label, Kontra Musik. Attending, you can see this first hand, as he can be found ferrying crates of beer in and out of venues, manning the entrances and dancing among the crowd. It makes a refreshing sight to see him playing such a hands on role and enjoying the experience so much himself, and instils confidence that Intonal’s greatest cheerleader is also its principal organiser.</p>\n<p>By extension of this, Intonal’s programming seeks to highlight at least some of Malmö’s local talents, and there are events which take place here which are difficult to imagine being pulled off without a personal relationship preceding the bookings. One of the events which drew me to the festival for example, was the chance to see Andreas Tilliander dust off his Mokira alias for an exclusive six hour sleeping bag concert. Similarly, you could find Finn of Tomland, one of Scandanavia’s greatest hidden treasures, brewing a hypnotic four-deck ambient soup including cuts from the late Jóhann Jóhannsson.</p>\n<p>Another of the less conventional events was the chance to see Subtext’s Ellen Arkbro and Charlemagne Palestine play the pipe organ in the local St Johannes Church. Indeed, Thursday’s principal performer was arguably the structure itself, conjuring cleansing, meditative drones, at times blissfully tranquil, at others working to discordant cacophonies. Perhaps the most interesting thing about the performance was its opening, Palestine chanting gravelly incantations, stomping his feet on the polished wooden decking and chiming wine glasses together like a pissed up distant uncle at a wedding. The building’s architectural presence cast these sounds from all directions, audience members flashing gazes around the building trying to work out where he was situated. “There has been no greater synthesiser built in the 21st Century”, he exalted after his performance, gesticulating from the balcony. Arkbro exposed further nuances in the acoustics of the space, playing simmering brassy reductions akin to those found on her <em>For Organ and Brass</em> LP.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/910/28042870498_f3551ab4e1_b.jpg\" alt=\"e\"></p>\n<p><em>Aleksei Perälä preparing for his set.</em></p>\n<p>Primarily however, Intonal takes place at the aforementioned Inkonst, a former chocolate factory converted into essentially a rather spacious nightclub, with enough function rooms to host several events simultaneously. The space’s versatility was stretched to the fullest, ranging from nightclub to sleepover room, from 3D cinema screen to artist talk space - Pan Daijing ruminating on performance, collaboration and Werner Fassbinder, and Alessandro Cortini talking about synthesisers (rather a lot). At times these spaces seemed a little jumbled, and it would have been nice to enjoy some of the bigger acts in a space outside the venues bar. In particular Japanese motorik drumming group Goat, who played a fantastic set of interwoven drums and amp-crunched drone, and noise-wave duo Group A, who adapted their set to something comparable to one of Carter Tutti Void’s shows, suffered slightly for the inferior acoustics and reduced visibility of the space.</p>\n<p>All in all however, Inkonst made an impressive hub for an array of performers with such a diverse range of styles. Jamaican dancehall troupe Equiknoxx felt like a particularly clever inclusion in the billing, blasting the audience with an hour of hard-hitting bassweight, while collaborator Shanique Marie acted as a rather lively compère, corralling an audience from somewhat reserved music scenes into heavy skanking. Pitchfork commented last year that Equiknoxx are bringing back dancehall by making it weird again, which is a fair observation, but as well as being weird, their music is also a hell of a lot of fun, something lacking in a fair amount of electronic music circles today.</p>\n<p>Preceding this was Elysia Crampton, a performer I’m not sure how to describe other than using the word ‘glambient’. Crampton took to the stage with keytar in hand, like a runaway member from the ‘70s band T-Rex. Her tranquillising, anime-dreamscapes brought to mind Leyland Kirby somewhat for their jarring theatricality, yet it was truly unlike any other performance I have seen, and a very memorable one for that reason.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/978/41870520451_0792c2242f_b.jpg\" alt=\"q\"></p>\n<p><em>Alexis Langevin-Tétrault plays his Interférences machine.</em></p>\n<p>Another of the more vivid performances came from Alexis Langevin-Tétrault, performing as part of Mutek’s curation of wonderful science-fiction oddities in basement concert space, The Black Box. Preceding a kaleidoscopic 3D audiovisual performance from Maxime Corbeil-Perron, Langevin-Tétrault showcased his Max MSP programmed webbing contraption Interférences, causing portal rupturing static explosions as he wrestled with a mesh of thick cord. The physicality of Langevin-Tétrault’s performance would have been enough as a spectacle on its own, yet it was sonically very impressive too - harsh-gated nuclear fission synthesis filling every crevice of space.</p>\n<p>The Black Box was also the setting for some of the bigger names on the lineup. Former Nine Inch Nails session musician Alessandro Cortini performed what appeared to be a rather self-indulgent show about his youth and family, set to mid-00s Oneohtrix Point Never style, arpeggiated ambience. Fennesz on the other hand provided a standout performance of amp-caked crescendos and buzzing guitar fuzz. A friend of mine once posited the theory that the best music makes you head bang, whether it’s appropriate or not, and sure enough I found myself nodding affirmative motions to the oceanic waves of sound blasted through the venue.</p>\n<p>Pan Daijing also made a notable impression, especially following her earlier artist talk in which she discussed the interplay of emotional drain and catharsis playing live has for her. The room fell silent as she began a warm up routine as if about to embark on a mountaineering expedition, donning a silken black mask and chanting eerie vocals atop a snowballing exorcism of musique concreté and chugging Cabaret Voltaire rhythms. My only regret was that the performance didn’t go on longer, as Daijing cut to a sudden silence at the height of tension. Then again, I guess the best things in life should leave you wanting more.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/972/41870521781_e32e54be63_b.jpg\" alt=\"a\"></p>\n<p><em>Pan Daijing throws off her mask mid-performance.</em></p>\n<p>Intonal has a very DIY feel to it in many ways and this is undoubtedly part of the charm. The first night’s event for example took place out in one of Malmö’s supposed former problem areas, in a cabin like structure above an auto garage. Finn of Tomland took up duties playing between performers, delivering an array of styles with remarkable plasticity. Cuts from the likes of Martsman and Dyl morphed seamlessly between oceanic soundscapes and tweaked out minimal rollers. Rabih Beani delivered supple oceanic modulations and there was also reverent slow motion electronics from Body and Guts, yet the highlight of that first evening was undoubtedly local act Börringe Kloster and Imad Al Tamimi. Their hybrid of live oud alongside electronic backing, saw burgeoning Middle Eastern tonalities work to an enchanting climax, prompting Nuri Bilge Ceylan style philosophical introspection.</p>\n<p>One of the things I noticed at this event, as well as several others, was how many of the artists booked hung around to enjoy the experience themselves, not just collecting their cheque and heading out, which is further testament to the curation and programming. Intonal feels as much for the artists as the punters in that sense. Intonal has also committed to a gender balanced lineup without making a big song and dance about it, which is how it should be, and makes the experience much better rounded than some of its contemporaries. Admittedly, there are a few considerations which might make it feel a little slicker, such as being a bit clearer about the ticket prices. A few of the bigger events, including the Mokira sleepover and final party, turned out to be additions to the standard ticket price, which left a slightly sour taste for some (although not too much of a dent in the wallet).</p>\n<p>This didn’t cloud enjoyment too much though, and at Intonal you have the feeling of being welcomed into something intimate and almost cooperative feeling. In essence, there feels less of a removal between artist and audience at Intonal. Perhaps this is the direction we are heading in as more and more people seem to be developing their own involvement in electronic music. Other festivals could take note of this welcome change.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zDvbg2z7760\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>Part of the score for Jonny Greenwood's '48 Responses to Polymorphia', an homage to Krzysztof Penderecki.</em></p>\n<p>After the Industrial Revolution, a lot of art portrayed nature in a pre-capitalist nostalgia. The Impressionists in particular presented life before the impending invasion of technology, progress, and modernism. They wanted to show a world that was neither hostile or in much need of change. One that was wholly-harmonious with humanity. Such a task may seem impossible. Indeed, many of the Impressionists became frustrated that their art could not capture nature’s infinite intricacy. A mere human could not pluck out the heart of its mystery. In a letter to his son a few weeks before his death, Paul Cézanne expressed his dissatisfaction after a lifetime of painting the great outdoors:</p>\n<p><em>“...as a painter I am becoming more clear-sighted before nature, but […] with me the realisation of my senses is always painful. I cannot attain the intensity that is unfolded before my senses. I have not the magnificent richness of colouring that animates nature. Here on the bank of the river the motifs multiply, the same subject seen from a different angle offers subject for study of the most powerful interest and so varied that I think I could occupy myself for months without changing place…”</em></p>\n<p>From Vivaldi’s <em>Four Seasons</em> to Prokofiev’s <em>Peter &amp; The Wolf</em> and Debussy’s <em>La Mer</em>, classical music has made many attempts to regurgitate nature in musical form. But I have always found these impressions somewhat unconvincing. When they do work, the resemblances are cartoonish: like the quack of a duck played an oboe. Other times, the imitation has to be spelt out. If it was not called <em>La Mer</em>, would we still compare the string-swells to crashing waves? It’s almost as if the composer worried that his impersonation lacked conviction. That only by name would the likeness reveal itself.</p>\n<p>To suggest that nature is infinite is also to suggest it is paradise. But a lot of contemporary music has rejected this notion. In the 1950s, John Cage began dissolving the historical opposition between art and life; mind and matter. Through a series of experiments, Cage made music incorporating silence, chance, and noise to show life’s brutal reality, not just its naïve innocence. In so doing, he didn’t only present new music, but a new way of listening. It encouraged an opening of oneself to the environment; to the ever-present here-and-now. It suggested the daring possibility that all noise could be music; and that all music was simply noise. Cage taught us that it is not enough to sound like nature, we have to <em>be</em> like nature too. For Cage, it was dishonest to represent the environment in part only. The natural world is a simultaneous muddle, and ought to be heard in all of its messy complexity.</p>\n<p>Brian Eno made a similar ‘return to the natural’, writing music that not only evoked landscapes, but acted like a landscape itself. The birth of the term ‘ambient’ came with the release of Eno’s ‘ambient series’, starting with the landmark <em>Music for Airports</em>. The idea, as Eno recalls, came from spending time bedridden in hospital, listening to an LP of harp music:</p>\n<p><em>“...I realised that the amplifier was set at an extremely low level, and that one channel of the stereo had failed completely. Since I hadn’t the energy to get up and improve matters, the record played on almost inaudibly. This presented what was for me a new way of hearing music – as part of the ambience of the environment just as the colour of the light and sound of the rain were parts of the ambience...”</em></p>\n<p>Those early LPs in Eno’s ambient series (alongside Harold Budd and Laraaji) became <em>genre-ative</em> for a new music obsessed with scenery. Ambient is now arguably the genre most associated with nature, taking natural environments as its primary subject matter. Wolfgang Voigt has cited his outdoor experiences with hallucinogens as the inspiration for his ‘Gas’ project, working to, “bring the forest to the disco, or vice-versa”. Boards of Canada take their name from the National Film Board of Canada, whose nature documentaries provided inspiration (and sample material) for their work. Ambient even spawned environment-specific subgenres, such as arctic ambient, where the likes of Biosphere, Thomas Köner, and Marsen Jules replicate the glacial movement of ice and wind.</p>\n<p>Field recordings have radicalised some of these principles. Taking the natural sound-world of a particular environment (rainforests, deserts, mountains), field recordings are made to leave you with nature ‘in itself’. Each represents an auditory document of a surrounding, a sonic snapshot from somewhere else. In so doing, field recordings attempt to expunge the human from the creative process altogether. Circumventing the observer’s paradox, field recordings offer a ‘view from nowhere’. As David Igantow once put it, “I should be content to look at a mountain for what it is and not as a comment on my life.”</p>\n<p>Another purpose of field recordings has been to raise awareness of conservation. <a href=\"https://www.birdnote.org/show/kauai-oo-hawaiian-forest-bird\">BirdNote</a> in particular archives the sounds of birdsong from around the world, including those that are now extinct. Their goal is a kind of escapism, “transport[ing] listeners out of the daily grind and into the natural world”. In doing so, they hope to inspire listeners to deepen our care for nature, and ‘biodiversify’ our sonic environment. The ecology and art platform, <a href=\"http://wormworm.org/\">Worm</a>, have warned that such an approach risks romanticising extinction. The field of acoustic ecology makes a similar move, logging the diachronic changes of an environment through sound. One famous example of acoustic ecology tracks the buzz of insects in response to increased pollution levels. Through deep listening, and analysis of sound, we can track changes that remain hidden to the eye.</p>\n<p>The ‘90s brought an unusual resurgence of the environmental movement. Mystic ravers Spiral Tribe espoused an anarcho-primitivist politics, hosting free raves (or ‘gatherings’) in the open spaces of the home counties. Their calling was to make a primordial return to our prehistoric selves through dance. In many ways the UK rave scene wished to hit reset on culture, to free us from the tyranny of history, and start again decoupled from capitalist drives. Psytrance also flourished, marrying spiritual mantras with animal song. It even produced a subgenre, ‘Forest’, devoted to organic and earthy timbres. At the time, new age spiritualism had entered the public mainstream. First Lady Nancy Reagan visited an astrologer, Princess Diana consulted spirit mediums, and Norwegian Princess Märtha Louise even founded a school dedicated to communicating with angels. There was also a resurgence in UFO conspiracies, healing crystals, and spiritual self-help manuals. One unintended consequence of this was the introduction of ‘chillout’ CDs. British supermarkets sold whale-song, rainfall, and dolphin sonar for the ‘stress-buster market’, fortifying the urban info-warrior for battle. A spring-cleaning of the head for a clearer mind in the office.</p>\n<p>I suppose there is something strange that music based in electronics wants to replicate nature. After all, there is some squabbling amongst musicians over the perceived ‘naturalism’ of certain electronic sounds. At some point in the past, detractors regarded almost all electronic music as lifeless, cold, animatronic. This is perhaps unsurprising given its pre-occupation with futurism, cyborgs, computation and so on. But now, hardcore tech-heads have begun arguing for the ‘warmth of analogue’ as a justification for its superiority. John Peel once defended the pops and hiss on vinyls by retorting, ‘life has surface noise!’ But why would we want our music to sound like life in the first place?</p>\n<p>There is no reason to assume that nature has an inherent beauty or benevolence. Such an assumption is what philosophers call ‘the naturalistic fallacy’. Talk of this or that behaviour being ‘natural’ and thus desirable makes a false equivalence between what ‘is’ the case and what ‘ought’ to be the case. This can lead to some dodgy politics. So-called ‘race realism’ and ‘scientific racism’ used measurements of the natural world (skull size, phenotypes, genotypes) to justify pseudoscientific compartmentalisation of race into a hierarchical system. Today, the alt-right and white supremacists are renewing an unhealthy obsession with genetics, as can be seen in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jan/10/ucl-to-investigate-secret-eugenics-conference-held-on-campus\">recent uncovering</a> of a secret eugenics conference held at University College London.</p>\n<p>Talk of biology or ‘naturalism’ is also often brought up in the context of queerness and degeneracy. The Christian right often condemn gay people on a naturalistic basis, citing reproductive organs as a kind of sexual instruction manual, a heterosexual imperative: have babies, or else! Trans and non-binary people are also under scrutiny for ‘deviating' from nature. Anti-trans rhetoric almost always comes back to talk of biology in an essentialist attempt to legitimise and justify transphobic violence. This same logic is also used to invalidate gender nonconformity and non-binary identities, such as in the <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> <a href=\"http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-sexually-identify-as-an-attack-helicopter\">attack helicopter meme</a>. Homophobes once argued that being gay is a slippery slope to beastiality; transphobes now argue that being trans is a slippery slope to identifying as helicopters.</p>\n<p>Many queer artists have thus had a rocky relationship with mother nature. But some have reclaimed this focus on biology, with a clever twist. Looking back to the body can open questions around the anguish of gender dysphoria, or the experimentalism of queer sexuality. Arca and Lotic refocus on the body in their artwork, where we see contorted skeletons and bulbous fleshy torsos. In Sophie’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es9-P1SOeHU\">latest video</a>, her face is stretched and manipulated beyond recognition. AJA also recently donned a ‘femme guts’ costume on stage: external intestines made of bright pink sequins.</p>\n<p>For me, the most rewarding art depicts nature as an unpredictable disunity. Think of the chaotic spontaneity of Olivier Messiaen’s avant-garde birdsong, or the wild oscillations of Merzbow’s <em>Dolphin Sonar</em>. In <em>De Natura Sonoris</em>, Krzysztof Penderecki's scratchy string pieces emulate nature's scary side, like the brittle sprawl of dead tree branches. Orla Wren has made sonic representations of the birds and the bees, but included with them the (often unpleasant) squarks and screeches of wildlife. Animal Collective sample the squelch of insects in mud; they growl and yelp like possessed children.</p>\n<p>Too often, artists cherry-pick the sweetest fruits of the outside world. We sing of raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens. Like Cézanne before, this shows the world not as it is, but as we wish it to be: elegant, beautiful, cohesive. Eden before the Fall. Seldom do we see the tooth-and-nail struggle for survival that is integral to the natural world. If art has any purpose, it is to reconcile us with our difficult world. But such a reconciliation must first offer a vision of nature that is all-encompassing: all the way from the petals of the flowers down to the rotten undergrowth.</p>\n<p><em>Listen to our latest Resonance FM show on music and nature with Moonbow and Worm <a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/radio/nature-and-music-moonbow-worm\">here</a>.</em></p>\n",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Mike Terry.</em></p>\n<p>Tonight will see the opening of 'Sound and Visions', a weekend of concerts and screenings curated by Max Richter and Yulia Mahr. Held within London's colossal Barbican Centre, the weekend will host an eclectic program of 18 audiovisual events. Music and film are given equal weight over the next few days. There are scheduled performances from Richter himself, as well as Colin Stetson, The London Syrian Ensemble, and a performance of Bach pieces by Víkingur Ólafsson. But there is also a broad range of cinematic highlights, with projections of Maya Deren, a documentary on Meredith Monk and even soundtrack work from Grouper.</p>\n<p>But what ties all of this together? Richter and Mahr have worked together for over 25 years as part of StudioRichterMahr, a collaborative home for their respective creative projects, with aim of covering, &quot;all manner of collisions between sound and image&quot;. Richter and Mahr have written that the upcoming weekend also has an aim, and one that is equally nebulous. &quot;‘Sounds and Visions’ sums up one of our central concerns&quot;, they write. &quot;[T]hat creativity exists as a social project that can illuminate the lives of individuals and society as a whole, and that art exists beyond all boundaries.”</p>\n<p>To help unpack this, and to discuss the weekend ahead, we caught up with Richter and Mahr to talk Stravinsky, rocket cars and Virginia Woolf.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/17556554&color=%23747474&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Tell us about the work you have done together - Why do you think you work well together? Where do your creative differences lie?</strong></p>\n<p>(MR) Like most creative relationships its actually quite tricky to define where our work starts and where our “ordinary” lives end — everything is related and everything influences everything else. In a way there is a seamless continuum between our daily “what if?” conversations over morning coffee and the final works, either musicial, visual or filmic, that are the outcome of this process. It is hard to define origins and boundaries over a 25 year span: the simple version would be, “we talk about stuff we are working on and then we work on it, sometimes together, sometimes apart”, but beyond that there are no rules. I am not an image maker, and Yulia is not a musician, but the thematic and intellectual cross fertilisation is a constant.</p>\n<p>(YM) StudioRichterMahr is an incubator for ideas and I love that. It’s dreaming and scheming and trying to see if an idea amounts to anything. We work well together because we really like each other. Because, while we share a set of values, we are actually very different people. It’s fiery and we argue all the time, and somewhere in the middle of it all we find interesting paths. We don’t always agree on the outcomes but that’s part of it! We don’t always work well together actually, but that’s also OK. I feel like we are only just getting started in a way. You really need to have been at something for a long time before there’s anything there.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about the <em>Sounds and Visions</em> weekender – how did it come about? Why did you want to do it?</strong></p>\n<p>(YM) We’ve been talking about curating together for a long time but it never felt right till now.  A couple of motivations lie behind the program. It is a chance for us to make the repeated case for the connectedness of creative languages and for our vision of the role of creativity in society. Creative work exists beyond genre boundaries, and can break them down in other spheres. It is also, of course, a chance to see and hear the things we ourselves wanted to experience.</p>\n<p><strong>I was intrigued by the artist choices. At first it seemed unusual to put Colin Stetson &amp; Caterina Barbieri together, but now makes a lot of sense to me. Can you explain a little more about your artist choices for this event?</strong></p>\n<p>(MR) In the case of Colin and Caterina there is a link that goes beyond genre, and that is the psychological hinterland in both artists work: each in their own way point beyond our normal experience. Transcendence is the link — one of the most powerful experiences creativity has to offer. There are other, more obvious pairings, for example the two visions of Bach offered by Víkingur Ólafsson and Will Gregory’s Moog ensemble, or the different visions of the solo producer instrumental music presented by Jlin, Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith and Clark.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/825/41981943972_a8a6cc8be9_h.jpg\" alt=\"xx\"></p>\n<p><strong>‘Sound and Visions’ is a broad theme. What, if anything, links together the likes of Waltz with Bashir, Jlin, Maya Deren, Bach and so on?</strong></p>\n<p>(YM) It’s really more about making connections between artists than anything else. What speaks across time and creative languages, where are the fertile meeting points that could lead to something else? In some cases we are making a political point with the pairings or events, in some cases a creative argument. Sometimes it’s about shining a light on something that’s almost forgotten (the Stravinsky film for example). Uniting everything is an interest in pushing and opening boundaries, there are no solid boundaries, just porous ones always in a state of flux.</p>\n<p>A lot of what we are presenting is work by artists who pose questions and explore ways for creative work to shake up our preconceived ideas about the world we live in. Charles' and Ray Eames' visionary <em>Powers of Ten</em> or Harvard’s Sensory Ethnography Lab’s <em>Ah Humanity</em> are excellent examples of this in the film program, while Max has programmed a work by his teacher Luciano Berio, whose 1968 Sinfonia asks similar questions in the musical sphere.</p>\n<p><strong>I was wondering if you could maybe expand on the following: “creativity exists as a social project that can illuminate the lives of individuals and society as a whole, and that art exists beyond all boundaries”. In what way does creativity exist as a ‘social project’? What boundaries does art exist beyond?</strong></p>\n<p>(YM) Actions in the world are social actions, and musical and creative actions are no exception, so the question of the social role of creative work comes up immediately. In this program we are presenting the world we believe in — diverse, egalitarian, open, searching. As to boundaries, we will leave Virginia Woolf to answer this one: “Lock up your libraries if you like; but there is no gate, no lock, no bolt that you can set upon the freedom of my mind.”</p>\n<p><strong>Tell about your relationship to Barbican as a venue – what was your thinking in hosting the weekend there? How does the event relate to Barbican’s architecture?</strong></p>\n<p>(MR) The Barbican itself is one of our favourite places to be in the city, embodying in its architecture the tremendous, maybe utopian, optimism of the modernist era. Do you remember when we were all going to be flying around in rocket cars? That's what the Barbican feels like.</p>\n<p><strong>Max – what can you tell us about the premieres you will be performing? What can we expect?</strong></p>\n<p>(MR) We are playing my 2010 record <em>INFRA</em>, in a new large ensemble version, as well as <em>Three Worlds</em>, both music from my collaborations with Wayne Macgregor at The Royal Ballet. Both works fuse instrumental and electronic languages, but are quite different in their texture. <em>INFRA</em> (the title is from the Latin for “below”) is a meditation on the 7/7 London bombings, while <em>Three Worlds</em> is a very wide ranging trip through three novels of Virginia Woolf, scored for a massive orchestra, electronics, vocals, surround sound…</p>\n<p><strong>Finally, I would be curious to learn about your thoughts on the future of soundtracking (or more broadly, the coupling of sound &amp; vision). Where do you see film heading with regards to its use of music? What hasn’t been tried yet?</strong></p>\n<p>(YM) Sound-tracking is in a tough spot. In more mainstream cinema, composers are really tied by the temp track phenomena and by having to deliver in stems. In cinema you are only as free and as good as the director lets you be. This is partly why I show some films where there is a more egalitarian relationship between filmmaker and composer (the three shorts). You can hear the time in these scores! Today's sound-tracking is so rushed.</p>\n<p>But there is also great freedom coming through. <em>Ah Humanity!</em> from Ernst Karel, Verena Paravel &amp; Lucien Castaing-Taylor (which unsurprisingly comes out of an academic rather than commercial environment) is a great example of this. And there are a lot of scoring projects stemming from the initiative of the composers (let’s see what Clark comes up with — so excited to see this!). Even in mainstream cinema I feel there is, at last, an acknowledgment that the last fifteen years or so have just about strangled cinema scoring and this has led to increasing acceptance of experimentation once again.</p>\n<p><em>Find out more about the festival <a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2018/series/sounds-and-visions-curated-by-max-richter-and-yulia-mahr\">here</a>.

In what the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/14/georgian-techno-fans-extremists-clash-tbilisi-fight-club-culture\">Guardian dubbed</a> 'a carnival of dissent', thousands rallied calling for the resignation of Georgia's prime minister and minister of internal affairs. These latest protests have a wider context beyond the clubs though. Bassiani has connections to LGBT groups and the White Noise Movement, a political group focused on drug decriminalisation.

    "content": "<p>Jan Jelinek's releases have always been about exploring subtlety and nuance. Perhaps none more so than on his latest album, <em>Zwischen</em>, which translates as 'between'. The album is about magnifying the sounds between words, layering and manipulating gentle stammers, nervous laughter and pauses for breath.</p>\n<p>Jelinek's source material comes from 12 interviews with public figures, ranging from the likes of Lady Gaga to Marcel Duchamp or Max Ernst. The vocal collages are linked to a synthesiser, triggering discordant reverberations, cloud-minded atmospheres and free-jazz style incarnations of glitch.</p>\n<p>It's a project delivered with sincerity and humour in equal measure. Jelinek has titled each piece with a question from the corresponding interview, ranging from the nonsensical: 'John Cage I've been told to ask you the following question: Where are you going?' To the potentially uncomfortable: 'Yoko Ono, you were born into a rich, aristocratic family in Tokyo. Do you see that in yourself?'.</p>\n<p>Similarly, we are presented with a range of manipulated responses. 'Lady Gaga, you once said in an interview that you write music for the fashion industry. Is fashion as important to you as music?' is a sultry and inviting listen, her effortlessly stylish intonations supported by a bedding of warm, gently fluttering ambience. In another example, Slavoj Zizek's characteristically rambling and chaotic vocal delivery is fermented into a paranoid expedition into the inner psyche.</p>\n<p>Across each offering, Jelinek has managed to distill something of the character of each of his subjects, with typical style and poise. He is one of the few composers able to present considerably abstract, conceptual work, and make it a joy, rather than a chore to listen to.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/403098258&color=%23919191&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>The first time I met Mats Erlandsson I didn't know who I was talking to. In Stockholm's EMS studios, where Erlandsson works, we chatted briefly about the studio and the limits of radio broadcasting. My only thought was 'this studio engineer seems a bit friendly', but my stupid brain hadn't put 2 and 2 together. It was only afterwards that I realised 'Mats' was 'Mats Erlandsson', whose releases with Posh Isolation the year before had been on near-constant repeat.</p>\n<p>Erlandsson's music is often difficult listening. It almost sounds like the sonic representation of conflict. Competing drones tackling one another in a tooth-and-nail struggle for survival. The sound sources are also obscured, as if purposefully vandalised out of recognition. Before reaching your ears, it's as if each instrument has endured a grueling post-production process. Every sound is twisted,  stretched, flattened, cut, made to work against itself. Not sound speaking for itself, but sound tortured into telling the truth.</p>\n<p>Some of Erlandsson's most interesting music also comes through collaborative work, most notably with the brilliant (and criminally overlooked) Yair Elazar Glotman. Last year, they released <em>Negative Chambers</em> together, a welcome return to ambient done the acoustic way. The album boasts an impressive range of instruments: gimbri, violin, karkaba, miniature cymbals, cello, harmonium, steel string acoustic guitar, zithers, transistor radio, Tibetan singing bowl, amplified plate &amp; piano frame alongside Glotman's contrabass. Last year also saw the release of a dazzling new collaborative project, Dufwa, with Maria W Horn, on Horn's XKatedral imprint.</p>\n<p>Prior to our chat at the end of last year, Erlandsson sent me a text he had written on his thoughts on the role of media today. Opening with the line 'context is only a salespoint', he expressed his frustration with the <em>gimmickisation</em> of music. In an ever-crowded online market, recognition often requires a kind of musical 'schtick' to be remembered, a conceptual ornament for the easily distracted, a unique selling point, a product. But how does this impact the <em>kind</em> of music being made today? Are we finally heading towards the nightmarish conflation of music and meme?</p>\n<p>In this long-form 'meta-interview', Erlandsson and I talk about our discontent with interviews and music marketing in general, as well as CC Hennix and the formation of the Stockholm Drone Society.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4143184995/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=578771677/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://matserlandsson-poshisolation.bandcamp.com/album/valentina-tereshkova\">Valentina Tereshkova by Mats Erlandsson</a></iframe>\n<p><strong>Before this interview you sent me a bio text about your thoughts on music promotion and marketing. Can you expand a little bit on your thoughts here?</strong></p>\n<p>That was my sincere attempt at writing some promotional text for this new record [laughs]. I found it so hard since I was constantly second-guessing myself I just decided to write about what was going through my head instead. It’s an odd paradox criticising the marketing dimension of music in websites, magazines, social media and so on while at the same time operating in that field, although on a very small scale. At the end of the day, I did make the music and I insisted on releasing it. It didn’t just magically happen, it’s not like an accident, you know? And I do want people to hear it, so how can I earnestly critique the way music promotion is structured and published?</p>\n<p><strong>Having a gimmick or eye-catching novelty attached to some music is gold-dust for people like me because it’s easy to write about. But it means we’re slowly veering into a resurrection of ‘conceptual music’, which is worrying...</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, I had a weird experience releasing my first album with Posh Isolation, <em>Valentina Tereshkova</em>. Originally that was just a name of one of the tracks which ended up being the album title but all of a sudden people were saying I had made a Russian cosmonaut concept album. It was fun to watch in a way because from my perspective the way it came together was entirely a media and PR construction. It had nothing to do with the music itself, it was just a narrative constructed from these bits and pieces. On the other hand, of course the seeds to that narrative were already planted in the release by having two track titles that related to Tereshkova so it is not like I couldn’t see that coming.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think people read too much into the concepts behind albums?</strong></p>\n<p>Anyone can read as much or as little into an album as they like. It was just funny to see how well established this narrative became in the marketing of the album, without any real substance besides a name. The problem I think is that the experience of hearing music is so heavily tainted by preconceived ideas. So when a journalist propagates a theory behind your music, it has a huge influence on how people hear it.</p>\n<p>I guess for me this is less of a problem than for someone working within a very clearing defined space — like if you are devoted to always working with a certain instrument or process (two examples that come to mind are the Buchla modular and Just Intonation just in terms of how strongly they tend to define the outcome). It seems to me that the downside in that case will be that your work is always heard through a filter of that conceptual framework, which becomes impossible to disassociate from.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you believe in this idea of the ‘death of the author’ in that sense? Does your intended purpose count towards the meaning of the music or is it entirely irrelevant?</strong></p>\n<p>They’re just not the same. It’s just like being on different sides of a membrane. I have way too much insight into the music I make to make a good judgement on it from a listeners perspective. When I listen to other people’s music, I habitually try to break down how it was made, not necessarily with my full attention but like a process running along in the back of my mind. Whereas with my own music, I remember more or less how it was all made, since I was there. So the illusion is already broken. For that reason, I think the artist is always the worst judge of their own practices. I guess what this means is that for me the making of music does not serve the same purpose as listening to the music of others, which is probably a health approach.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s interesting how this concept applies to a live context. I read that Mozart’s concerts were full of audience  members applauding to themselves during parts they liked. It allowed for an active, vocal interpretation, basically. It’s only recently that the audience is expected to sit in respectful silence until the piece is over.</strong></p>\n<p>Well, the sit-down-and-be-quite-until-its-over-format has more to do with 19th century bourgeois concert house culture than with Mozart who had to operate in a context of being funcional- or background music or full-on entertainment shows.</p>\n<p>I think one of the most widespread misconceptions about music is that it can communicate an idea from the artist to the audience without the idea being corrupted in the transference. John Cage for instance was super surprised when he realised this was wrong. There’s a chapter in his <em>Silence</em> book where he says his world fell apart when he realised he could not accurately express his emotions in music to an audience, because they just wouldn’t get it. For me now, that just seems like the most obvious thing in the world, although it took me a long time to wrap my head around and accept. Music as a medium just really isn’t suitable for transferring emotional  information.</p>\n<p><strong>And yet music is talked about as this universal language</strong></p>\n<p>That’s true but I think people are just communicating with themselves. Which is fine, I don’t see that as anything negative at all, it’s just a feedback loop.</p>\n<p><strong>The same goes for applause I guess. You’re not so much expressing gratitude towards the performers but more to yourself and people around you — it’s an expression that you understood it and you enjoyed it.</strong></p>\n<p>It’s also a cultural thing — applause is a reasonable amount of expression within the confines of the traditional concert hall. You can just use your hands, you can remain seated. You don’t need to do anything too extravagant. I was recently thinking about the applause in jazz, which comes after the piece is finished but also within the piece, after each respective solo. When I was kid, I didn’t really understand when a solo ended since I hadn’t been conditioned to understand that musical form by ear, so the only clue for me was the applause. So applause has this structural purpose too.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1456893665/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=e99708/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://yairelazarglotmanmatserlandsson.bandcamp.com/album/negative-chambers\">Negative Chambers by Yair Elazar Glotman & Mats Erlandsson</a></iframe>\n<p><strong>It feels like Stockholm is at a very important cultural moment right now. I have asked a few people why this is and the answer I always get is always a material one — you have access to these great institutions like Royal College of Music, EMS and Fylkingen — but they’ve been around for a long time. So what’s changed?</strong></p>\n<p>Well it’s true that we have these institutions available which I guess makes a difference in terms of being able to practice one’s craft in a serious setting. But what they do that is specifically interesting is this continuum between them. So the borders between the Royal College of Music, EMS and Fylkingen have slowly became less clearly defined in terms of aesthetics. At a certain point in time there was a lot of cross-pollination between the school, the studio and the stage.</p>\n<p>Apart from the old institutions we already mentioned a more recent development that to me seems to have had a huge impact on the musical landscape in Stockholm are small independent groups/organisations like Drömfaktulteten, Masskultur, XKatedral and to a certain extent perhaps also Sthlm Drone Society (SDS). Then there are also people how function kind of like one-person-institutions when it comes to arranging, like John Chantler or Robin Smeds Mattila. I guess a main characteristic of the city at the moment is that all of these groups actually don’t have that much in common in terms of structure or function, and they span a pretty wide array of genres, but at the same time coexist within the same environment.</p>\n<p><strong>How did the Stockholm Drone Society start?</strong></p>\n<p>The Stockholm Drone Society was started by Maria [W Horn], who basically sent out a mass email to a bunch of people wanting to formalise something around all the drone music going on in the city. So the SDS thing was not the start of an interest in that type of music but rather a formalisation of something that had already been going on for a long time.</p>\n<p>My first real contact with drone and noise music in Sweden came about through Daniel M Karlsson and Jonathan Liljedahl, first at the school of composition in Visby and then later at the Royal College of Music in Stockholm. Their music had an enormous impact on me at that time and I was always sort of following them around — going to their shows and trying to figure out what their influences were. I’d been super obsessed with Daniel's music for years prior to that but that’s a whole other story. At the time we became friends, Daniel was very interested in the music of CC Hennix, who at that point in time was pretty much completely unknown outside of a small circle of people — this was before the release of <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FdCjLw1sqI\">The Electric Harpsichord</a></em> and before that article in The Wire which made her a bit more famous. I remember the only music which was available to us at the time from her was an .mp3 of a very bad recording from a Dutch radio show which had parts of The Electric Harpsichord as well as some other pieces from the concerts at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm in 1976.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I guess there is this lineage in terms of influence and interest in slow long form music that runs through a loosely defined group of people who at one point or another were affiliated with the KMH or Fylkingen. Some names that stand out for me in this regard are Daniel and Jonathan, Mattias Petersson, Isak Edberg, Maria W Horn, David Granström, Ellen Arkbro, Marcus Pal, Caterina Barbieri, Marta Forsberg and Kali Malone.</p>\n<p><strong>And CC Hennix was at EMS for a short while, right?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, Hennix was working on music at EMS during the seventies - both doing some form of text-sound composition and also helping La Monte Young realise one of his compositions using the computer studio there. Hennix was also involved in Fylkingen during this period before she left Sweden in the late seventies.</p>\n<p>Another Hennix-related thing that ended up having a lot of influence 30 years later was the Dream Music Festival of 1976 which was arranged by Hennix at the Moderna Museet. That thing was a festival of continuous sound with a lineup that is pretty amazing — La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Hennix and works by Terry Jennings. For me, this event took on pretty much mythical proportions especially since I could only find sparse documentation of the whole thing and it seemed so unreal that long form music could be presented in such a high-culture setting without compromise.</p>\n<p><strong>It seems like there is a quite widespread interest in La Monte Young in Stockholm.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah — for me that also came from Daniel M Karlsson, but by accident. This was during that time when I was sort of studying the music of Daniel and I found this folder on a computer at school after he finished with a bootleg La Monte Young collection [laughs]. I’d been aware of La Monte from before but this enabled me to study the music more in depth. Some time after this Marcus [Pal] and Ellen [Arkbro] took their La Monte-fascination to another level by actually going to study with him in New York. This still seems completely surreal to me.</p>\n<p><strong>La Monte Young’s project with drone music was a predominantly spiritual one. To lift people into this psychic heaven. But what is the use of drone music today?</strong></p>\n<p>I don’t really believe that music needs to have a use that goes beyond the personal. I guess you could view drone or long form music in some political sense, but then again all musics are political if you look at the practitioners. The most banal political aspect of drone is that it contrasts the experience of everyday life. But that’s a little too easy, it’s kind of like saying drone is the music equivalent of going to a spa.</p>\n<p>But it’s also pretty unsellable. It’s inherently fringe. Having music that operates on another timescale is also interesting and transgressive for me. It doesn’t conform to the medium of entertainment. Even at festivals like Atonal or CTM, the music is packaged within a digestible timescale: a standard 60 minute set which means they can’t really accommodate music performances on the scale of someone like La Monte Young or CC Hennix, since both of them compose works that are theoretically infinite.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the Stockholm Drone Society shows like?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, the main thing that have set them apart from other shows is the length — all the shows we’ve done where around 8 hours or so. Since all of these shows have been in the form of extended showcases they consisted of a string of performers each playing a piece around 60 minutes per person. So that ends up being a long suite of music in a similar vein but with different characteristics depending on the composer.</p>\n<p>Most of the shows we’ve done have been in Mimer during Norbergfestival. I think it works well for someone who is not familiar with drone just because of Norberg’s setting in the mine. So people get to spend the night in this spectacular setting within Mimer which I think taps into this childish fascination with being able to stay up late as well, at least for me [laughs].</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/965/28281222048_ea79d75cc8_h.jpg\" alt=\"xx\">\n<em>Mats Erlandsson &amp; Yair Elazar Glotman, photo by Camille Blake.</em></p>\n<p><strong>I like the framing of your album with Yair Elazar Glotman as “dislocated ‘folk’ music for the current dark ages”. So that has a political function.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, I guess so. But then again that narrative is also something that came pretty late in the processes. For me the importance of that album personally had to do with me being able to go out of the area where I felt most comfortable and push myself to do something different, in terms of how the music sounds, the recording processes and also dealing with the idea of collaboration. At that point it’d been a long time since I had done any formalized collaborative work with anyone so when Yair suggested we’d work on music together I couldn’t really see what we were going to do — I was kind of nervous but still excited to get to work with my friend.</p>\n<p>I’m really happy how that album turned out though, and I feel proud I was able to function on that level as a musician.\nAs a guideline while we were working we liked playing with this idea that we were writing some very constructed folk music, like murder ballads or something: highly contextual music but without any actual context, only loose imaginary context. It ended up being very associative music, just down to the instrumentation. On occasion it is almost borderline ‘Game of Thrones’ in its association [laughs].</p>\n<p><strong>There’s some really unexpected instruments on it, like the gimbri.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah that’s Yair’s. He was really into playing it when we started writing that album. I think the main reason for the instrumentation being what it is would be that we’re not really using any electronics for generating the sounds. If a piece needed some long sustained tones or something metallic in the high register or whatever we had to figure out what we had on hand in terms of acoustic instruments that could fill what function.</p>\n<p>So that’s what led to a lot of these prepared zither things or sustained harmonium chord progressions. Again, doing that had a big effect on me personally since a lot of the ideas on instrumentation spilled over into my own music. Especially the prepared and sustained zither stuff ended up really shaping the sound of this album that’s coming out on Portals Editions in the spring, although that might not be audible straight away.</p>\n<p><strong>What can we expect from your performance at Norberg with Yair this year?</strong></p>\n<p>I think it’d be good not to expect hearing music from the album, other than that I have a hard time trying to control anyone’s expectations. We’ve been asked before by people if we were planning on performing in conjunction with the album release last year but I always thought it’d be weird to perform the music from the album as a duo since it’s very much a studio work in terms of instrumentation — a proper live performance would require creating a fairly esoteric ensemble and doing some extensive transcription and rehearsal work, so basically it would be impossible from an economic standpoint.</p>\n<p>Anyway, when we agreed to do a performance for The Long Now in March of this year, we decided to compose a new long-form piece that’d be possible to perform as a duo while retaining the instrumentation and textural characteristics of our previous work, this time working from a base of electronically treated zither and harmonium recordings in conjunction with extensive tape manipulation. The upcoming performance at Norbergfestival will be the second iteration of this work, which I hope we’ll continue to develop throughout the autumn.</p>\n<p><em>Mats Erlandsson will perform at this year's Norbergfestival, alongside Yair Elazar Glotman.

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Aoki Takamasa.</em></p>\n<p>Swiss artist Zimoun constructs sound sculptures which challenge the eye as much as the ear. From his studio in Bern, Zimoun makes use of the most rudimentary of tools: wires, cardboard boxes, plastic bags, cork balls and small electric motors are deployed in their hundreds. The structures he creates are so large they often impact the architecture of the gallery spaces they occupy. A devoted reader of John Cage in his early years, Zimoun’s primary interests lie in simplicity, repetition and the relationship between sound and space.</p>\n<p>Since 2003, Zimoun has also co-run Leerraum with graphic designer Marc Beekhuis. Described as a ‘platform for creative exchange’ rather than a label in the traditional sense, Leerraum is characterised by similar themes to Zimoun’s individual output. The majority of its releases are delivered in surround sound, some utilising ‘ambisonic’ techniques, whereby audio is even directed from above and below the listener. Each batch is paired by a photography series from select visual artists, before being sold as single editions rather than produced en masse. This said, Zimoun and Beekhuis are keen for the label not to become too exclusive, making each recording available to stream on their <a href=\"http://www.leerraum.ch/\">website</a>.</p>\n<p>With recent releases including a kosmiche-style synthesiser jam from Mihalis Shammas, a minimalist dub headtrip from Matt Spendlove, aka Spatial, and several Zimoun collaborations, we decided to catch up with Zimoun to discuss the aims of the label, function in architecture and early sonic experiences.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us a bit about how Leerraum first came to be.</strong></p>\n<p>In 2003 graphic designer Marc Beekhuis and I founded Leerraum. We have known each other since we were teenagers. We shared a common interest in various forms of minimalism, in simplicity in general, in reductive methods and principles. One day Marc mentioned the name Leerraum as a possible title or ‘frame’ to do something based on those interests. Leerraum is the German word for various things related to emptiness. We felt it greatly fitting of our interests, and so Leerraum was born…</p>\n<p>We have been publishing audio works in a series since the beginning, and each of these series are based around images by a visual artist. The current series is based on Philipp Schaerer’s amazing <em>Bildbauten</em>. Between these series we release objects and other works which do not relate to a series.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...in that moment both of these worlds merged together. You hear what you see and you see what you hear...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>I’ve seen you reference Leerraum as a ‘platform for creative exchange’ as opposed to a record label. Given this, is its commercial success important? If not, how do you measure its performance?</strong></p>\n<p>Since we have been focusing on very specific, ‘niche’ works since the beginning, we have never had any commercial ambitions or expectations for this project. If something is sellable or not doesn’t matter here. For us it is about content and focus – about collecting and curating. It is also about retaining the freedom to do what we want to do and keep everything fully independent. We appreciate it is and always was, a very small and specific project.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/830/42175119721_7e34d1a317_b.jpg\" alt=\"q\"></p>\n<p><strong>Some of your early releases were in batches of 100-1000, now most are just one edition. Explain how you arrived at this decision and how the releases are typically sold.</strong></p>\n<p>We did small pressings in the beginning and those have got even smaller over time. We started to question the border between ‘art object’ and ‘storage medium’ or ‘package’ – between material and data. Questions about value also appeared. We’ve only produced one physical copy of the audio works for a while and we handle it like any other piece of art. The single editions come with a signed certificate; signed by the artists who did the audio and the cover image, as well as by Leerraum.</p>\n<p>All published works are available for free streaming over at the website, in great quality, full-length and even in multi-channel if your device is connected to such a sound system. The signed physical copy is for the art collector, the free online stream for the community.</p>\n<p><strong>I liked that about Leerraum - it stops the short run releases feeling too exclusive.</strong></p>\n<p>Even if the physical copies are very exclusive and based on the idea of owning and collecting an artwork, we always felt its wider availability was important too. We do not intend to give away the works for free, but we still want to make them available as a stream for those interested. Again similar to a painting – one person can own the original, but many still know about it from reproductions on the internet, books etc…</p>\n<p>The art itself is available for everybody that way, without losing the idea of the unique original piece. There are some serious thoughts behind this, but also some playful and ironic ones too. In the end Leerraum is more an art project itself, rather than a conventional form of label or publisher.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/827/42128762852_9136547aae_b.jpg\" alt=\"s\"></p>\n<p><strong>It’s nice that you can’t skip through tracks on the website which encourages you to listen in full. How do you think the way we consume music today has altered our listening habits?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s an interesting questions but I’m not sure I could say… Probably the tendency leans towards speeding everything up – listening for ten seconds and then pressing the ‘like’ button or not. We focus more on slowing down.</p>\n<p>Many of the works we publish can be listened to as space – as a room or as a sculpture, rather than as ‘music’ in the conventional sense. More like a building which you can enter and look around. Often there isn’t much changing over time in these compositions, but there’s a lot to discover within their micro-structures. It’s similar to listening to the sound of a river. You might think it always sounds the same at first, but once you start to listen to it actively, you realise how deep and rich the sounds are.</p>\n<p><strong>Ambisonics and surround sound are a common theme in Leerraum releases and your own art installations often immerse the audience in the experience completely. Where does your interest in these ideas stem from?</strong></p>\n<p>Somehow I was always interested in sound as a three dimensional and spatial experience. Sound defines space, and space creates sound. Leerraum started in the early age of 5.1 home cinema systems – people slowly started to buy surround-sound systems at home to watch movies. That way the ‘potential consumer’ got technically able to listen to multi-channel compositions or speaker-based sound installations at home. Several of the artists we worked with had also been experimenting with multi-channel speaker set-ups; it’s a different way to experience sound and compose.</p>\n<p>In my installation work I often use simple mechanical sound sources to build three-dimensional soundspaces. There are often hundreds of these spread around the architectural space. I started this type of work when I was doing a lot of multi-channel compositions. I recorded the sound of materials and did arrangements and compositions with them on the computer, playing them afterwards over several speakers.</p>\n<p>As I was always driven by and interested in simplicity, reduction and directness, I then started to wonder how I could create such compositions in real time, rather than recording, processing and re-playing them. At that point I started to experiment with physical and mechanical systems to set materials in motion to generate sounds in a very immediate, direct and visible way. I have done visual works and experiments with acoustics since I was a kid, but in that moment both of these worlds merged together. You hear what you see and you see what you hear.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/832/41315732205_cd1b178da0_b.jpg\" alt=\"q\"></p>\n<p><strong>What was the first immersive sonic experience that really grabbed your attention?</strong></p>\n<p>[Laughs] That’s hard to say… I don’t remember, but I assume the first immersive sonic experience was probably even before I was born, sitting in my mother’s womb. There must have been lots of sounds around… But an early experience I do remember – I was probably about three years old, in the furnace room at my grandparents’ place.</p>\n<p>There was an old oil heater, a very big machine. Being next to this huge, and at that age very impressive piece of machinery was exciting. The heater was working and making an intense drone – deep, dark and very physical. It turned off and slowly cooled down. While doing so, it produced these tiny clicking sounds as the materials were changing temperature, which reflected off all the walls in this small room. It was an amazing piece just perfect for a gallery…</p>\n<p><strong>Your installations are often referenced to architecture and you have worked with architects in the past. Where does your interest in the relationship between sound and architecture come from?</strong></p>\n<p>While most of my installations are site specific, the acoustic and visual spaces are core elements of my work. In that sense the architecture itself, is an essential and very influential element in the development of a piece. The sound properties of a space relate to its dimensions and its materialisation. It’s hard for me to imagine sound without a spatial context, or space with no connection to sound, or to develop an installation without knowing where it will be. In that sense space, architecture and sound always have been connected in the process of creating my work.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any particular buildings which have directly inspired your work? And are composers like Iannis Xenakis an influence for example?</strong></p>\n<p>Great architecture is very inspiring to work with but there is not one single building that inspired me most. All of the spaces I have been invited to work with in the past have been inspiring and even completed the artwork somehow. Similarly to other creative work, in architecture I’m mainly interested in simplicity – in structures that have a deep sense of function, rather than just being decorative or fancy for the sake of it.</p>\n<p>I can’t stand fancy fusion architecture which speaks so loudly but doesn’t say anything, or architects which try to make something extravagant looking which ends up being more of a self-actualisation project rather than an architectural one. Some timeless heroes of mine include Heinrich Tessenow, Sigurd Lewerentz, Kay Otto Fisker, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Arne Jacobsen and Klas Anshelm. Contemporary architects I appreciate include Tadao Ando, Peter Zumthor, or Sergison Bates.</p>\n<p>Xenakis understood three-dimensional space as part of music, but I wouldn’t call him an influence. The artist that I was studying most in my teenage years was John Cage. I read almost everything he wrote. I see an influence in him, especially in the way he understood all kind of noises (and silence) as music. I liked his free and interesting form of thinking…</p>\n<div style=\"padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/53024211?color=ffffff&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js\"></script>\n<p><strong>You’ve also released a few prepared motors (one alongside a cardboard box and cotton ball). How do you envisage these being used by the buyer and what made you want to make your materials public?</strong></p>\n<p>In between the series of audio releases we usually place single objects which do not relate to a specific series. Within those, I also placed two small works of mine, as you mentioned. They are both powered by a 9V battery and can be turned on by the owner. Once they are powered they start to move and to generate sounds that way.</p>\n<p><strong>Are these the kinds of tools you use when producing the records you’ve released on Leerraum? Is there an acoustic element like in your gallery work or are these done completely ‘in the box’, so to speak?</strong></p>\n<p>For my pure audio compositions, I usually work with recorded microsounds of various materials, as well as with sounds from mechanical experiments. Sometimes I even include some audio recordings from installations I’ve done. Next to this, I’ve been working on a series of collaborations for the past 11 years, where I use sounds from other artists to create multi-channel compositions. Within this series there have been collaborations with Oren Ambarchi, Kenneth Kirschner, Richard Garet, Helena Gough, Fourm, Asher, Andy Graydon and Mise En Scene.

    "content": "<p>Sweden's Norbergfestival have announced a new wave of acts, including <a href=\"http://www.ursss.com/2018/01/young-boy-dancing-group/\">Young Boy Dancing Group</a> and the Fast Forward collective (Sella Turcica, DJ Ibon, Sugar, Schacke and Ida Engelhardt). The inclusion of Young Boy Dancing Group is part of a broadening in Norberg's booking policy to include media outside of music. The festival will also host <em>Tanzplage</em>, a dance performance from choreographer Lea Martini; and <em>Scape</em>, an immersive project exploring the sonic qualities of body movement.</p>\n<p>This festival's performance and arts theme is entitled <em>Choreomania</em>, marking the 500 year memorial of the Dancing Plague of Strasbourg, when a group of dancing people bursted out into the public sphere of the city. As the Nobrerg website explains:</p>\n<p><em>&quot;It was early July 1518 and hundreds of lower working class citizen filled both streets and squares with non-synchronized movements. At the time, dancing was not much about moving, but rather about standing still, forming different poses, like letters in a text. The dancers in Strasbourg formed a non-readable mass, interlinking the individual and the group: difference in between the two was unnecessary. Some of them danced until they died, but yet they didn’t stop dancing. It went on for weeks.&quot;</em></p>\n<p>In addition to this we can still expect the usual flurry of left-field electronic acts. As ever, the festival looks to boast a truly diverse range of music, this year including Nkisi, AJA, Errorsmith, An Gella, Kablam, Gábor Lázár and an exciting collaborative performance from Yair Elazar Glotman and Mats Erlandsson, with much more to be announced.</p>\n<p>Tickets for Norbergfestival 2018 can be bought <a href=\"http://norbergfestival.com/\">here</a>.</p>\n<div style=\"padding:42.5% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/248062517\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js\"></script>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Elizabeth Cacho.</em></p>\n<p>The cover of <em>Agnosia</em>, the latest release from Hypermedium depicts a kind of Mescaline vision of Alien meets Predator meets Donnie Darko. Chemically altered visions aside, this most recent dispatch from the Greek label looks to the Latin American crossover for the hybrid trival productions of Mexicali producer Marco Polo Gutierrez, aka Siete Catorce.</p>\n<p><em>Agnosia</em> is at times richly organic, at others jarringly stripped back. ‘Canto’ delivers a heady mix of forest wildlife and fragmented speech atop primal percussive experiments and warm, inebriated pads. ‘Risa’ is pure dancefloor psychedelia, gentle drum machine rhythms clattering beneath sweltering synthesised atmospheres.</p>\n<p>‘Susurro’ is a declaration of war in comparison. Dislocated skin drum rhythms and serrated arpeggios are ruptured by ‘Pulse X’ style low-end missiles. ‘Dialogo’ takes a similarly affront stance, albeit with weary intensity rather than outright confrontation. Churning low-end modulations thrust forward like an early Plastician or J Sweet dubplate - metallic percussion, glacial ambience and the occasional interruption of porch-door chatter lending a trip-like quality.</p>\n<p>Hypermedium have displayed a knack for absorbing cutting edge club music on a global scale. <em>The Rise of Gqom</em> for example, by South African based collective Audioboyz ,delivered a headspinning, reductionist take on the Durban grown genre, while <em>Agnosia</em> navigates European club tropes and the trival scene perhaps more local to Gutierrez with ingenuity and precision. I look forward to the next surprise.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/505712793&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "date": "2018-05-27T00:00:00.000Z",
    "content": "<p>There have been many attempts at fusing electronic and classical music over the years. There are projects like Ambiq, featuring Max Loderbauer, The Vladislav Delay Quartet or the Max von Oswald Trio as well as blunter attempts like the 1Xtra Grime or Ibiza Proms. In Aldeburgh, Suffolk, there was even a festival, Faster Than Sound, expressly interested in pairing electronic musicians with their classically trained contemporaries. Suffice to say, these projects are delivered with varying degrees of success and it’s a risky gambit to make, especially for artists who have already developed their own style entirely electronically.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the Barbican Centre ahead of last weekend’s event, Darren Cunningham, better known as Actress, reflected on this very fact, and how his collaboration with the London Contemporary Orchestra (LCO) is not a revolutionary new idea in that sense. The pairing first emerged in 2016 with a previous performance at London's favourite brutalist utopia, and the two entities have been developing their collaboration gently since then. This latest performance coincides with the release of <em>Lageos</em>, a double 12&quot; LP of leftfield experimentation and classically-led introspection.</p>\n<p>Prior to the headline billing, we were treated to supporting performances from Duval Timothy, who painted luscious forest glade scenes at his piano stool, crafting soothing dream-like atmospheres around a series of offbeat field recordings. Blackest Ever Black affiliate Silvia Kastel then delivered a meandering performance of subterranean techno, meditative drone and electroacoustic oddities. Her performance was somewhat stifled by interjecting late-comers, yet still delivered an immersive and gently hypnotic support.</p>\n<p>After a short interval, Cunningham took to the stage with the LCO. Sitting in near dark, except for a string of Japanese Kanji projected on the back wall and the odd flash of a desk lamp, Cunningham tweaked various parameters like an engineer working frantically into the night. For the most part the accomplishments of the London Contemporary Orchestra were allowed to shine through, Cunningham content to apply gentle processing to their sounds, as well as the occasional interjection of stuttered drum machines.</p>\n<p>In short, it was hard to know where LCO stopped and Actress began, as they played in effortless synchronicity. This was heightened by the fact the LCO used the full range of their instruments' capabilities - tapping out rhythms on double basses and running their fingers along the strings to create oddball sound effects which at first appeared to be electronically sourced. The effect called to mind an album like Jon Hassell’s <em>Dream Theory In Malaya</em> – easy to get lost in and with a soothing, medicinal quality.</p>\n<p>As already mentioned there are plenty of projects of this brand out, but this one works, and works well. Cunningham is a musician of great versatility and originality, and the LCO showed similar flex in this performance to make their sounds meet in the middle rather than playing in a kind of awkward tandem as is often the way. Cunningham has stated previously that he doesn’t feel he would be able to make music without a belief in God, and this reverent quality to his music has always felt synonymous with much of classical music to me.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/335921119&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\"></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p>Anyone who followed Stray Landings in 2017 would have picked up on our praise of Subtext, the Bristol imprint headed by James Ginzburg. Last year, they released a very impressive flurry of LPs, from Ellen Arkbro's <em>For Organ and Brass</em>, Cevdet Erek's <em>Davul</em>, Yair Elazar Glotman's <em>Compound</em>, and <em>Clear Stones</em>, a collaborative album from FIS and Rob Thorne. We included all four of these LPs in our <a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/articles/the-stray-landings-christmas-pudding\">end of year list</a>.</p>\n<p>So you'll have to excuse my giddiness around Subtext's latest release: <em>To Shock the Sky and Shake the Earth</em>, the debut release from xin. This new LP continues a Subtext tradition in exploratory electronics: the never-ending search for novelty in a genre so often constricted by convention. Indeed, xin has made the decision to release the album through alternative distribution, including Resonate and a handful of independent platforms. On this decision, xin explained that they &quot;don’t believe that there should be one way to do anything, or in convention for convention’s sake&quot;.</p>\n<p>The album itself adopts some unusual compositional styles. Just listen to '<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/subtext-recordings/3-garr\">Garr</a>' from the album, a jarring reminder of the sampling's transformative sonic potential. Here, disparate elements and sound sources coalesce into a patchwork of noise. It shouldn't work but it does. To celebrate this release, xin has put together a mix for us, in their own words, &quot;a messy assemblage of things I've been listening to in recent months. I'm very much still learning and figuring things out when it comes to mixing, but I'm trying to be ambitious with it!&quot; Listen below:</p>\n<h3>No Tracklist Available.</h3>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&light=1&feed=%2Fstraylandings%2F0091-xin%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>I’ve rarely heard a label with a name more fitting than ‘Alien Jams’. Headed by Chloe Frieda, Alien Jams (AJ) showcases sounds that are warped and mangled, as if corrupted in transmission from an extraterrestrial broadcaster. Indeed, the label began as radio, with Frieda’s <a href=\"https://www.nts.live/shows/alien-jams\">fortnightly show</a> on NTS. But unlike a lot of the worst excesses of sci-fi electronics, this is music you can actually <em>jam</em> to. Music for the dancefloor, even if that dancefloor is on another planet.</p>\n<p>In Bellingham, a city 90 miles north of Seattle, she first began broadcasting with an interest in post-punk. This is somewhat unsurprising to me. After all, post-punk was a genre that thrived primarily through the encoded format of radio. Shows like the legendary John Peel Sessions circulated these sounds via the airwaves, at a time when no record label would touch them. For many, radio was the main organ of cultural circulation. It's no coincidence that Joy Division's breakthrough single, 'Transmission', took the format as its subject matter. Even if intended ironically, 'Transmission' captured something quintessential about radio's rapturous effects. Beaming through the air, radio waves electrify listeners in a way no other format can: galvanising generations into collective frenzy.</p>\n<p>Indeed, there was something appropriate about the dissemination of post-punk via the aerial bombardment of radio broadcast. Many of post-punk’s sonic features included harsh noise, vast reverbs and avant-garde electronics, like an overhead bombing raid, the bleak soundtrack to an alien invasion. Radio remains an entry-point medium for sci-fi sounds, as Frieda’s own career started with a small University station, KUGS FM. “They had such a great music library, I learned a lot whilst I was there. I did a lot of exploring”, Frieda begins. “I think post-punk was the perfect gateway for me.”</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3423502894/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=727179842/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://alienjams.bandcamp.com/album/beatrice-dillon-karen-gwyer\">Beatrice Dillon/ Karen Gwyer by Alien Jams</a></iframe>\n<p>There’s also an important sense in which post-punk became a vehicle for genre mutation. Joy Division morphed into New Order with the introduction of drum machines; Talking Heads branched out into synth-pop with the Tom-Tom Club; The Clash drew from dub reggae to experiment with whacked-out studio techniques. In short, the most celebrated music from that time made a conscious effort to be open to new sounds (post-punk was originally termed ‘new musick’), but bands that fell by the wayside remained dogmatically committed to guitars, drums and vocals: the Nuclear Family of rock bands.</p>\n<p>Frieda explains the impact of this music on her, “a lot of those artists were experimenting with synths and samplers, and I found that really inspiring, musically. I also loved Simon Reynolds’ <em>Rip It Up and Start Again</em>, that was a really important book for me. What I’ve heard from people who lived through that period, is that there were very strict divisions between people. What you were into musically was a major part of your identity. There were a lot of cliques and segregation by genre. But now there’s a lot more variation and cross-pollination. So it must have been confusing for their fans having to mingle with new groups suddenly.”</p>\n<p>Washington state is a curious place to find love for electronic music since the area is still somewhat living in the aftermath of the grunge explosion of the ‘90s. But there has retained an eager openness to new sounds. As Frieda makes clear, “I think because of grunge there was a really interesting scene that emerged afterwards. Music was clearly of great importance and there is a strong appreciation of culture and art in Washington. People on the west coast are generally open and quite supportive so if you wanted to play, most people would be pretty up for it. There was a feeling that anyone could join a band. I guess that generally happens outside capital cities, there’s less pressure to succeed, so there’s more creative freedom.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/967/42264533481_1426b9fa56_h.jpg\" alt=\"xx\">\n<em>Alien Jams Zine #1 - IMAGINED CITYSCAPES</em></p>\n<p>However, despite a burgeoning music scene, electronic music has only recently become more widespread. “It wasn’t a big thing when I was out there”, Frieda continues. “There’s a really good music scene there in general, and when I lived in Bellingham, they had a really good house venue scene. A few friends of mine had a house venue and bands would just come through and play at the house. It was an all-ages venue because they wanted to make music more accessible (clubs are over 21 of course). But that was mostly rock or indie bands. Dance music was definitely nowhere near as popular as it was in the UK. There’s such a strong history here. But it wasn’t appreciated in the states.”</p>\n<p>When Frieda moved to London in 2010, she made a conscious decision to turn her focus towards electronic music. “When the radio show started, I wanted to focus on electronic music throughout history and highlight new artists”, she explains. “I liked music that spanned many different genres under the electronic banner at once. I like experimentation, quirkiness, sounds you might not expect to hear on the dance floor. I want to surprise the listener as much as possible.”</p>\n<p>Frieda’s decision to turn Alien Jams into a label came as an organic expansion of what she was already doing on NTS. “If you’d asked me at the beginning if I would have started a label I would have definitely said no. It wasn’t on my agenda, I hadn’t really thought about it. But the radio show introduced me to a lot of interesting people and the guests really inspired me and made me want to put out their music. I guess I also met a lot of people also starting their own labels so it didn’t seem to daunting.” The label is therefore somewhat heterodox in that it grew from seeds already planted by the radio. “It was an extension of that. I think every release on AJ is different, and I want to keep that going, not be constricted by any stylistic rules. I’m very passionate about making sure the artists are happy with the process. I want it to be mutually fulfilling. It’s super rewarding if it goes well.”</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2651145473/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=599638410/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://alienjams.bandcamp.com/album/wilted-woman-home-listener\">Wilted Woman- Home Listener by Alien Jams</a></iframe>\n<p>Their first release, an oddball experiment in four-track cassette warbles and primitive electronics, came from oMMM in 2014. “That got the ball rolling. I got super excited about who I was going to ask next. It was an interesting experience, making it up as I went along. Figuring out how I do this and how to get presses made and so on. It was a really new experience but I managed it with some vital advice from my friends.” Since then, the AJ imprint has brought out some of the eeriest dance music in recent memory, including contributions from Beatrice Dillon, Karen Gwyer, rkss and many more.</p>\n<p>Last year, AJ produced the <a href=\"http://www.straylandings.co.uk/reviews/home-listener-wilted-woman\"><em>Home Listener EP</em></a> from Wilted Woman, who describes her own sound as &quot;anxiety rhythm&quot;. This theme continues on the latest AJ ‘family affair’ compilation, <em>Nervous System</em>, but makes a return to AJ’s more academic side. The name ‘Nervous System’ is meant to be understood ambiguously, both as a feature of the physical (the spine, brain and nerves of human anatomy), and as a kind of ‘Paranoid Android’ comment on modern alienation and computers (the kind of system or network that induces nervousness, anxiety, or dread).\nIn a spirit similar to the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, the sounds here are more like science experiments: full of auditory illusions and sonic obscurities, testing the limits of human hearing. Frieda clarifies, “I wanted to go back to the roots of AJ, have something that sat alongside the radio show. Sometimes I worry that the label and the radio show are leading different lives so this compilation was a return to the radio sound.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/980/28390765418_fac1e3d190_h.jpg\" alt=\"x\">\n<em>Nervous System</em></p>\n<p><em>Nervous System</em> also marks the first cassette from the label, a choice Frieda made with some trepidation. “I think format is important. But the new cassette is a bit of an experiment. Vinyl can be quite limiting in some ways because you have to wait for so long. I feel like some music really has to be heard ‘in the moment’, and vinyl is still very expensive of course. When cassettes first started coming back in vogue, I was a little skeptical at first. I didn’t have a cassette player and it just seemed like a bit of a faff! I wasn’t expecting to be into them as much as I am now. But I think cassettes allow smaller labels to get stuff out there, so that’s really important.”</p>\n<p>Anyone looking to hear these sounds live will not be disappointed, as AJ have been hosting live events for as long as it has existed. This summer will also see a celebration of AJ’s continuing legacy at the renowned Cafe OTO. “It’s been 7 years since AJ started, and I don’t really do birthdays but thought I'd organise a couple anniversary gigs this summer. We've just announced two dates at Cafe OTO: July 20th and August 24th, Including SHAKEY (Wilted Woman &amp; Silvia Kastel), acolytes &amp; alobhe, Rosen, xname and dj tesco. For the second show FOQL &amp; Copy Corpo will play alongside Brood Ma, CHXFX, rkss and Gary the Tall..&quot;</p>\n<p><em>You can now buy tickets for the Alien Jams birthday party <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/996523057178294\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 373px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3203504884/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://alienjams.bandcamp.com/album/v-a-nervous-system\">V/A- Nervous System by Alien Jams</a></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p>The work of Jan Jelinek has always been about finding beauty in microscopic details. His most frequently referenced work, <em>Loop-Finding-Jazz-Records</em>, was about fragmenting jazz samples into humid microhouse loops, charged with depth and hypnotic appeal. Most recently he released <em>Zwischen</em>, a study on the sounds we make between words: mutters, false starts and intakes of breath. The album was originally produced as a radio play and takes its source material from interviews with a diverse range of subjects. Indeed, it's not often you find Lady Gaga on the same album as Karlheinz Stockhausen...</p>\n<p>The album comes courtesy of Faitiche, a label Jelinek has run since 2008. He first released a series of recordings by the mysterious 'Ursula Bogner', often thought to be Jelinek himself working under a pseudonym. Indeed, the label's title, qualified as: &quot;a combination of facts and fetishes, [that] makes it obvious that the two have a common element of fabrication&quot;, might suggest there is some element of artistic license at play here.</p>\n<p>Since then the label has become a conduit for many of Jelinek's own projects, from his releases as Farben or G.E.S, to his collaborations with Japanese vibraphonist Masayoshi Fujita, or 'glitchtronica' outfit Computer Soup. With <em>Zwischen</em> published recently, we caught up with Jelinek to talk house parties with Ricardo Villalobos, forecasting Trump, and the future of Faitiche.</p>\n<p><strong>You recently released <em>Zwischen</em> on Faitiche, which was originally produced as a radio play. How does the recorded version differ to the original broadcast? How was it received in radio format?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, first of all the radio version is much longer - around 42 minutes. Therefore more interviewees are presented there, with an emphasis on German 'celebrities'. All the people on the album are included in the radio piece as well, but mostly combined with different, even more abstract synth patches. Working for radio is always coupled with strict deadlines, so I was forced to produce much faster than usual. For the album I took time to rework a few parts. My goal was to create a wider variety of sound and some more harmonic parts as well.</p>\n<p>But I’m afraid that <em>Zwischen</em> is still a very abstract sound work. How was the radio piece received?  I think quite well. They are going to broadcast it again this year which is an indicator of a positive reception!</p>\n<p><strong>Have you ever had any interaction with the subjects and what were the reasons behind your selections? Did you consider what their thoughts would be if they heard the LP when putting it together?</strong></p>\n<p>Hmm, no. I don’t think I ever interact with one of the interviewees personally.... A lot of them are already dead. My work with the interview sources was much more abstract: I focused on the voices timbre and their interruptions, not their thoughts. But obviously my choice fell on a few people, whose work is linked to sound poetry, Dada and/or Fluxus, perhaps because I thought that those persons eventually shared the same sense of humour for such work.

Your project was more about exposing the beauty in language right?</strong></p>\n<p>The ideas of a virus is perhaps too hypothetical, but nevertheless language is a universal and sprawling system, which affects our bodies, thinking and perception. So the virus metaphor captures it well. <em>Zwischen</em> was not really about language though. It was more about articulation, which is independent from language - a universal articulation so to say, which doesn’t transport meaning and is rather experienced as sound. Naturally such rhetorical failures sound mostly disadvantageous but maybe unjustly. If you change the perspective and focus on sound it definitely sounds beautiful as well.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1750/40712607500_76d8758a46_b.jpg\" alt=\"e\"></p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell me a bit about how Faitiche first started and the meaning behind the title as a crossover of fact and fetish? You have described your production interests as 'a constant drift' before - is the same true of Faitiche or are the aims for the label still the same as when you started it?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m not sure if I envisioned a particular aim while starting Faitiche. It simply had to work as a platform for my own projects and my friends' work. You mentioned it already: the word is a neologism, taken from Bruno Latour’s 'Actor-Network' theory. It’s based on Latour’s fundamental criticism to social constructivism, in which the subject generates all science and knowledge.</p>\n<p>Instead Latour introduces a new perspective. His theory puts the object into spotlight - an object, which isn’t necessarily determined by a subject and is able to evolve its own agency, independent from the subject. To cut it short: object can determine subject. I thought that it is an interesting aspect - especially when you plan to establish a record label. Record labels manufacture objects, which are highly charged with an agency - or at least the music industry pretends that…</p>\n<p>But back to your question: no, aims for the label are slowly changing. In fact I want to expand and de-personalise the label’s focus – release music, which isn’t necessarily connected to me anymore. I recently received some very interesting music by some young producers.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/306211330&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I was listening to the PrimeTime EP again the other day - it feels oddly prophetic with those quotes of Trump criticising the Obama administration at the start. How did you come to select the samples for that piece and do you get the same eerie feeling I do listening back to it?</strong></p>\n<p>[Laughs] Yes, indeed. But Trump is a phenomena, which always felt very eerie, even back in the days when I founded the label. Recently I saw Woody Allen’s <em>Celebrity</em> again. Trump has a little cameo there - this one is really eerie. <em>PrimeTime</em> was meant as a soundtrack for a video project by Broersen and Lukács called <em>Prime Time Paradise</em>. It was actually recorded and collaged live in my studio. I triggered and processed music samples, with the sounds of news channels randomly fading in and out. I didn’t have control over that, so the Trump sample happened accidentally. He was simply in the spotlight on that day. Now he is in the spotlight every day...</p>\n<p><strong>In another interview you mention some of the first house parties you went to were organised by Ricardo Villalobos...What do you remember from those parties and what was it about them that made an impression on you?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, I guess this very extreme form of music reception was fascinating me. Non-stop listening for a long term of time to very loud and very functionalised music. Also I remember that Ricardo was very good in hosting people - his top priority was always the party.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/340579250&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I also saw mention you have a teenage son - I wanted to ask, what are his thoughts on your music and work as a live performer? Has he been to a Jan Jelinek show yet?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, I think he saw a performance once - it was an Ursula Bogner tribute show. He is not really into music - even though he has started to fool around with Ableton Live. I have never asked him directly, but I guess my music rather bores him - like all teenagers he is really into Kendrick Lamar. But hey, everyone likes Kendrick Lamar, right?</p>\n<p><strong>Finally what's next for yourself and Faitiche?</strong></p>\n<p>It's hard to believe, but Autumn is tenth label anniversary, so I’m planning an extra vinyl reissue of the first release - <em>Ursula Bogner: Recordings 1969-1988</em>. For spring next year, my collaboration with Japanese drone musician Asuna is going to be released. Besides that I’m hoping to release an album by two young producers from Canada - but it is still in process, so please understand, that I can’t tell you more right now...</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/403101057&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>A new project, Serpente, has formed for the release of a stunning new cassette from Bruno Silva, perhaps best known for his work under the Ondness moniker. Silva himself has been working in the Portugese underground for over a decade, under a flurry of different names, including Sabre and Osso. I first became aware of his music through the recent compilation on Alien Jams, <em><a href=\"https://alienjams.bandcamp.com/album/v-a-nervous-system\">Nervous System</a></em>. His contribution, 'Maria No Raver', is a mind-bending mash-up of amen breaks and percussive loops. It sounds like samples play on top of one another without a care for form, repetition, structure, or any other staples of conventional music. But somehow, it works.</p>\n<p>It's funny how the mind can find patterns within chaos. It's almost like a kind of safety latch for the brain: a disorderly world may be more than the human mind can bear, thus we are condemned to find structure, even when there is none. Psychologists call this 'pareidolia', the phenomenon of deducing familiar shapes from random stimuli. Because of pareidolia, we see elephants in the clouds, Elvis in our coffee, and Jesus in our toast. This extends to sound too. The perception of 'back-masking' or hearing voices in air conditioners are also a product of this phenomenon.</p>\n<p>Any musician who has worked with sampling knows this weird <em>trompe-l'oreille</em>. Loop a sound, any sound, for long enough, and you start to hear its internal rhythm. Steve Reich explored this with 'It's Gonna Rain' and 'Come Out'. After enough repetitions, an unmusical sound becomes as rhythmical as a samba band. There are beats, stresses and even groove. This latest release from Silva on <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/tormenta-electrica-records/sets/serpente-rituais-101\">Tormenta Electrica</a> also seems to make work of this. Just listen to the lumbering mechanics of 'Sangue de Galo' or 'Sob a Palha'. It's a dizzying experience trying to catch the first beat, you are wrong-footed with every bar.  It's an auditory illusion, but one that you can (almost) dance to.</p>\n<p>There are also some clearer reference points, such as the broken-techno pulse of 'Venda de Altar'. And then there's 'Fio Obeah', made with an assemblage of 808s and the opening snare fill of reggae tracks. This is an astonishing debut release for a project, every track on here has something interesting to show. I'm already hooked.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1782427952/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://serpente101.bandcamp.com/album/rituais-101\">Rituais 101 by Serpente</a></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p>Brighton’s electronic music scene always seems to have always remained under the radar somewhat. Although not necessarily immediately apparent, it has a deeply ingrained noise scene – home to enterprises like Voyder, Lost Property and The Outer Church. Dance music has also thrived in Brighton, notably with the likes of Aka Aka Roar, Well Rounded and the recently revamped Patterns nightclub. It is arguably the crossover between these scenes which Present Tense Recordings, a newly emerging label in the city attempts to explore.</p>\n<p>Their latest release comes from label co-owner Alex Jacobs, aka qgb, in the form of <em>Hornets</em> — an Austin Caesar-reminiscent hybrid of digitised house, glitch-laced techno and delicate, angular sound-design. Indeed, speaking of the album Jacobs noted: “lots of the tracks have references to insects, present in many of the samples used”.</p>\n<p>This nod to the microscopic world of creepy crawlies is taken further by the fact there will be a limited run of USBs designed by Sam Illife, an innovation design engineering student at RCA, available alongside the digital version, cast in amber. With the release upcoming on June 11th, the label have kindly offered up an exclusive stream of ‘Alarm Bells (If Language Was Pretty)’, a warp-speed amalgamation of jackhammer kick drums, nagging metallic percussion and medicinal ambience.

    "content": "<p>Sissel Wincent’s tracks feels like bass music without the waffle. Her productions are focused and considered — only elements that are 100% necessary make the final cut. I was lucky enough to catch her set at Norbergfestival a couple of years ago. She delivered her factory percussion with such force that the venue ceiling raining dust down from the ceiling. I was later informed that this was actually pigeon shit.</p>\n<p>Her latest offering on Peder Mannerfelt’s eponymous label suggests she won’t be changing her ways anytime soon. <em>Inspirational Quotes</em> delivers characteristically claustrophobic scaffold techno to brutal effect. ‘Cynical’, for example, has distortion coursing through its veins. Crumpled low-end kicks build to a charging forward stomp, corrosive modem soundscapes trembling in the backdrop. ‘Ponytails’ on the other hand fragments gabber tonalities into an eerie industrial half-stepper, foundation-quaking blasts of synthesis rising between rusted steel percussion and whistling sine tones.</p>\n<p>There is a sense that all these tracks verge on malfunctioning — off-kilter rhythms and skewed melodics never quite gain a settled footing. ‘Yellow Lines’ feels jaunty and unhinged, warning siren bleeps and callous drums churning in awkward syncopation. Then there are tracks like ‘Still Undetermined’, which takes on a ‘90s Warp quality with squelching modulations and glistening Drexciyan chord progressions escalating right until the tracks close.</p>\n<p>In an interview with Resident Advisor, Peder Mannerfelt previously revealed how Paul Purgas of Emptyset began encouraging him to release tracks which seemed half-finished in his eyes. The move has been a stunning success for Mannerfelt, and it appears this all thriller no filler approach is proving equally apt for Wincent. <em>Inspirational Quotes</em> is a release of great depth and character, and I look forward to seeing her next move.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/459101580&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Myriam Boucher.</em></p>\n<p><em>Interférences</em> is a tangled mesh of hooks, elasticated webbing and personal attachments. The contraption was originally developed by Alexis Langevin-Tétrault, in an attempt to introduce some physicality to performing electronic music, equating its increasingly untamable web of cords to the metaphor of an online social network. As it grows beyond the borders of its owners expectations and intentions, it becomes increasingly difficult to control and make sense of.</p>\n<p>The project took on an additional significance for Tétrault as he was building it however. Upon falling ill with an at the time undiagnosed health problem, Tétrault channeled his experiences in hospital labs, being tested and run through scanners into the project, coming to view it as a form of catharsis in which he is able to relive this period, coming out the other side stronger and more resilient than ever.</p>\n<p>Previously, he has released prolifically under the alias Alexeï Kawolski, putting together a multitude of works focused on the sweet spot between ambient, glitch and outright noise. The results wouldn't sound out of place on a label like Ad Noiseam or Kvitnu, yet Tétrault has been happy to self-release these works, giving him the freedom to present them exactly as he wishes.</p>\n<p>We caught up with him after a recent visit to Athens to discuss the origins of <em>Interférences</em>, Montreal's music culture and his family's background in instrument making.</p>\n<p><strong>You recently got back from the Athens Digital Arts Festival where you were performing with <em>Interférences</em>. What's it like to travel with?</strong></p>\n<p>It's not that bad because when I built the device I had in mind that I have to be able to fly with it. Everything can be taken apart into fairly small pieces and put into a regular suitcase. It's not over the size or weight limit so everything is OK, and it doesn't cost a lot! I don't have problems with security too much - I have to explain what it is but they always let me in. Only in the U.S. is it harder to get in with that kind of stuff - they're more stressed about it [laughs].</p>\n<p>Last year I was in New York which is really close to where I live, but it was still really complicated. It took like a day of day of people screaming at me and putting on a big show to impress me or something. In the end it was OK. I was coming from France and they didn't really understand what I was doing with that device. They said we know it's not dangerous, but we don't know if you're coming with someone else and maybe there's another part of the device. You could build a transformer or something that could destroy the city [laughs].</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/291013796&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>I can sympathise with that. When I saw <em>Interférences</em> I thought it might be a device to destroy the world. Can you tell me a bit about the history of it and how you came to build it?</strong></p>\n<p>15 years ago I was mainly a guitarist, but my passion was to make weird sounds you don't usually make with a guitar. A lot of pedal effects and DIY stuff. At some point I gave it up and started to play with a modular synth and a computer. At that point I stopped doing shows and was working in the studio much more. I missed going on stage and doing something physical, so that was the starting point of creating something with which I could interact and put on a show using my physicality, not just hiding behind a computer.</p>\n<p>I come from a family who build string instruments; violins and things like that. Both my grandfather and my great great grandfather did that, so the idea of putting like a digital string instrument together seemed coherent with my family history.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;The nature of the device means I react differently every time I play it.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There's different layers of meaning in that performance. I'm building a network with those cables which is increasingly complex. I can create sound but at the same time it becomes harder for me to keep control of everything. More and more it becomes a fight against the machine.</p>\n<p>Maybe the more personal layer of meaning is that when I was starting to create the musical and visual content for this show I started to feel sick. Everything is fine now, but at that point I didn't know what I had. I started to have side effects which were giving me electric shocks and stuff - it was really really bad. I didn't know what was going to happen and I had to go for lots of scans and things like that. That really inspired me when I was creating <em>Interférences</em>. It ended up being like a primal scream to say I am going to fight against whatever, until the end. All the weird sounds you hear in the show are close to what I was hearing in the machines I was being scanned in.</p>\n<p><strong>Didn't that experience make you want to do the opposite though - get away from hearing those kind of sounds? Part of me would think you'd just want to pick up a Ukulele or something.</strong></p>\n<p>[Laughs] At that point it was a way to deal with it and to have some sort of control over it.</p>\n<p><strong>Does it feel cathartic?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, for me the show really is catharsis. Absolutely. Each time I do this performance I try to focus on that state of mind and do something sincere. It's not fake what I'm doing - the intensity is real and I'm giving all I can. Each time I do it, it's like I pass through this process but at the end I'm still and alive and I've won! So for me it's a catharsis and it's uplifting.</p>\n<p>The next project I do will probably focus on a different energy. Something much quieter, trying to do the opposite...</p>\n<p><strong>There's a slight political metaphor to the concept as well right?</strong></p>\n<p>It's there at some point but I try not to be really in your face about it. I like people to make sense of what they see and make their own story. Years ago, when I did my first degree in sociology, people were much more critical of technology. It was the beginning of social networking about 12 or 13 years ago, so we were really studying that and trying to understand all the social dynamics that would create all of that.</p>\n<p>At a conceptual level it's about working with networks that allow you to create something, but at the same time it becomes like a jail. You lose a little bit of freedom in what you are doing. You lose control over it. There's that aspect but you can also see the show and not think about that.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/978/41870520451_0792c2242f_b.jpg\" alt=\"w\"></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Curt Lundberg.</em></p>\n<p><strong>I noted with your Alexeï Kawolski projects there was a political link to, writing an EP in response to Trump's election. I was wondering how much politics influences your work and your thinking generally.</strong></p>\n<p>Kawolski is really inspired by politics. It's a side project where I can create a lot in a short period of time. It's another form of catharsis. Almost all of the things I did with this project are inspired by political events going on around me. Usually it's something that's upset me or made me feel like I need to do something, but there's nothing I can do. It's a way to canalise all the anger or the sadness of things.</p>\n<p>Things are really weird in the U.S. and I'm not a fan of Trump at all. I needed to do something about it. I used to be involved in a big student movement in Canada, mainly fighting for school fees but asking for a big change in society in general. That kind of experience really influenced me. It affected me, so I thought I'd put it into music.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/162031277&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>You mentioned that after <em>Interférences</em> you will probably move on and do something totally different. Your projects seem to be very separate from one another.</strong></p>\n<p>Maybe it's not a good business plan to work like this but it's not how I think or who I am. I think it's a great aspect of being an artist that you can reinvent yourself and change direction. I really like to go out of my comfort zone. When I feel like I know what I'm doing too much, it stops being fun. <em>Interférences</em> is great because the nature of the device means I react differently every time I play it. I'm always a bit out of my comfort zone.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the link with Mutek too?</strong></p>\n<p>Well Mutek is really big in Canada and probably the main event in the year. I've known them for a while. At first they contacted me about Kowalski about four or five years ago. It's a relationship we've built over the years. They seem to really like <em>Interférences</em> and have been helping me book shows around the world. They know everyone and have partnerships with pre-existing festivals. They like people doing things outside the mainstream.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you find Montreal as a city generally? Is it somewhere you're just studying or do you see a home as well?</strong></p>\n<p>Montreal is where I want to be right now. It's great because it's big enough that there's always events going on but it's not so big that you get lost and don't know anybody, like you do in some cities. It's a really creative place to be. It's kind of the joke in Montreal that everyone is an artist - everyone is in a band or has their own project. There's so many people feeding you with creative ideas and so many venues dedicated to artistic things and digital art. Mutek is based there and there's also Elektra, which is kind of a smaller Mutek. It's a great place to be right now and the cost of living isn't too bad...</p>\n<p>I don't know if I will stay here all my life but for the following years I see myself in Montreal.</p>\n<p><strong>When you say everyone is an artist in Montreal, does that same distinction apply to France?</strong></p>\n<p>It's not the same in France, everyone has a big knowledge of art and everyone can talk about, it but I'm not sure everyone is an artist there.</p>\n<p><strong>... Everyone's a critic?</strong></p>\n<p>[Laughs] Yeah. The state of the art in France - it's maybe more conservative there what they're doing. There's digital arts too but it's only just started to be explored. It's something quite new for them. In Montreal, there's been a really big scene for more than 15 years now. It's not just dance music but really edgy things. I don't see myself living in Paris right now - it's somewhere I go for work but that's it.</p>\n<p><strong>Even aside from electronic music, Canada has produced some amazing bands too.</strong></p>\n<p>For sure, there's some help from the government too if you want funding to travel or something. I guess there's money in art there which helps artists create new things. The government in Canada give you just enough funding so you can do what you want to do, but it's not that much that you don't feel you have to do anything... It's just enough that you can do what you need to do to present your project in front of people. The help is there - if you're really looking for it, you'll find it.</p>\n<div style=\"padding:73.17% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/229006642?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js\"></script>",

    "content": "<p>Many people will have heard Alessandro Cortini without knowing his name. As a touring member of Nine Inch Nails since 2005, Cortini contributes some of the band’s most jaw-dropping sonic pyrotechnics, as well as writing fresh material such as on their five-part instrumental album, <em>Ghosts</em>. Just listen to the lumbering industrialism of ‘<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYqXYbyON0Q\">19 Ghosts III</a>’ or the Lynchian ambience of ‘<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTYb5XwJ7Ss\">25 Ghosts III</a>’, for example.</p>\n<p>But to understand Cortini’s music in terms only of NIN would be to ghettoise a great artist. This has been patently clear through the development of his solo career, under a range of different monikers: SONOIO, Blindoldfreak and Modwheelmood. But under his birth name, Cortini has established himself with seven albums to date, including releases on both Hospital Records and Important Records. I first became of his solo work from 2014’s brilliant <em>Sonno</em> (Italian for ‘sleep’), a somnambulistic meditation on time, dreams and memory.</p>\n<p>Cortini is known among musos for his erudite ramblings on gear. Name-drop any classic synthesiser is like opening a Pandora’s Box: Cortini will give you its history, mechanics and sound; its contribution to a genre and the artists that made it famous. The truth is, Cortini thrives on this kind of talk. It’s his calling, his one true love, and that passionate for gear comes through in the music. Just take a look at his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/blindoldfreak/videos\">YouTube channel</a>, littered with instructional videos on how to use his equipment.</p>\n<p>But consequently, many interviews with Cortini focus purely on the technical, which can overshadow the more personal elements of his sound. AVANTI, his latest project, is perhaps the most personal yet. A 45 minute film, live soundtracked by Cortini, depicts his childhood in Italy, shot by his grandfather on Super-8. Earlier this year, we caught up with Cortini to talk about AVANTI, the intersection of sound and vision, and the return of Nine Inch Nails.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yeveIybd1BQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>I saw your AVANTI show at Barbican a couple of days ago. How did you think it went?</strong></p>\n<p>I thought it went great. I had a great time, the venue was incredible, and so was Sarah Davachi, who’s a friend and artist I really respect. It was amazing, one of my favourite shows so far.</p>\n<p><strong>How variable is the AVANTI show? To what extent are you ‘bound’ by the film?</strong></p>\n<p>Well it’s a very peculiar way of performing in a sense, I watch the footage as much as the crowd does, and the only difference is that it’s my family, so emotively speaking, depending on the night, I might have a different response to it. This was the fifty-something-th show. So far, it’s still incredibly emotionally charged to be able to play a show about my family. What makes it different for me, technically speaking, is that there are plenty of performance aspects that can change. There’s obviously volumes and EQ, panning and effects, but also intensity and dynamics. I have control of every aspect, I can make a lot of creative decisions during the performance. Another thing that influences me a lot is the context of the show, relating to the technical aspects, how the show has been organised, if I like the promoters and things like that. If something’s not right, it does tend to affect how much I enjoy the performance.</p>\n<p><strong>The sound and projection felt pretty much as good they could be, from an audience perspective.</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, exactly, I couldn’t have said it better myself! I walked around the room during the soundcheck, which I usually do, and it sounded great everywhere. The projector was super bright too, with a huge screen. It definitely felt like a small theatre or cinema, which is what I had in mind when I was first thinking about presenting AVANTI.</p>\n<p><strong>I’ve been thinking about home movies, and how they’re usually very private. What made you want to make yours public in the way you have?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, I know that the audience that comes to see the show, and they are thus able to make my movies their own experience. I don’t think they see me, or my parents or my family. I think the marriage of the sound and vision bring out a very personal emotional response. And that seems to be what people tell me when they come out after the show. They’re in tears at times, which is very touching because I didn’t expect that at all! It’s very flattering that something that means so much to me, and is a tribute to my family, could evoke such profound emotions in other people.</p>\n<p><strong>Have your family seen the show? How did they find it? It must be quite surreal.</strong></p>\n<p>They haven’t seen the show, but they have seen the footage. Sometimes I send photos and videos to my mum and dad, and all my mum says is, “damn, you were fat as a kid!” But they’re very happy. I think it’s probably harder on them, because they didn’t experience those times as I did. Even though it’s melancholic at times, I look back with happiness because I had no fears or responsibilities. The world was a playground.</p>\n<p><strong>Having listened to the AVANTI record since seeing the show, I now can't separate the music from the images of the film. Was this something you intended? That they’re sort of the same thing, woven together?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah for sure, That’s kind of the way it was born. Once I found the visuals, filmed by my grandfather, I wrote the music to them. I do believe obviously that the album stands on its own, and gives an example of the emotions content of the show as a whole. I don’t think it’s just the visuals though. I think it’s also where you see it and how you see it. It would have been hard to release it, as is, as an audiovisual project, packaged as a DVD and CD or something, or to release it online that way. I think the whole package of seeing it in a theatre or cinema or somewhere like that, with the chairs, people around you, the silence right before the show starts, and all those things. I think all that contributes to the experience of the show.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1802/41115657650_3862986c30_h.jpg\" alt=\"cc\"></p>\n<p><strong>How did playing with Nine Inch Nails shaped what you’re doing today? It seems that they chose you to join the band because you were already creatively talented at the time, so I’m wondering what from your process predates playing with them, and what you picked up from them?</strong></p>\n<p>Well it’s hard to say how much of who I was, or who I was going to become, was clear when they picked me. I remember having quite a long conversation with Trent [Reznor] before they chose me, and I think he saw me as someone who was into modular synths, and synths in general, and someone who played guitar. At the time though, I think it was more about hanging out with me. They knew I could play the parts, but I think the idea at the time was to see if I’d be an OK person to hang out with and go on tour with.</p>\n<p><strong>It was more like a personality test?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, it was less about what I could do and more about what I was like, because in reality, it’s quite a small fraction of time you spend playing music together, compared to just being around each other and interacting. That said, my priority was always on taking what Trent had done in the studio and rendering that live, and embellishing it. From day one, I was trying to use my abilities to make the band shine more. That led to working in the studio together too, which was a lot of fun.</p>\n<p>And there, I really emphasised learning about synthesis and sound, rather than just becoming a better keyboard player. And I learnt so much from him too. Trent is very good at what he does, because he’s being himself. He’s fulfilling the role of Trent Reznor, so of course he’s fucking great at it! We’re actually going to back back together for a tour at the end of this month, so I’m ecstatic to be back with them, and hang out and joke and fart. Just to put something not too important in the interview, there will be a little bit of farting [laughs].</p>\n<p><strong>You’ve been quite critical of the culture of Eurorack before, how it attracts hobbyists and collectors but not musicians so much.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, I don’t know if that came out the right way. I don’t think it attracts hobbyists. A lot of people approached me about that and I feel like I was making a bit of an elitist discussion over it, which isn’t the point. I think with Eurorack, a lot of what you can do comes down to personal taste, and the player being stimulated by what they do. I don’t think that equals value, which is very subjective.</p>\n<p>Maybe I’m getting even deeper in the sand here, but the bottom line is that there’s so much going on in that world, and there’re so many options, that 99.9% of the time, if I close my eyes, it doesn’t give me much that I can anchor onto emotionally. There’re are a few exceptions, Colin Benders for example, and Robert Aiki Aubrey Lowe, and Caterina Barbieri, and a few others. But they’re just using it as a tool to do what they want to do. At the same time, I totally relate to the entertaining aspect of Eurorack, for people that use it after a day of work and it makes them feel good.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s coming up for Alessandro Cortini?</strong></p>\n<p>Well I’m still playing a lot of AVANTI shows, which I’m extremely grateful for, because it’s very rewarding. Like I said, I’m also going to be out with Nine Inch Nails for a good chunk of this year, which will be fun. There’s also a lot of activity when it comes to releases. The Forse series on Important Records will be re-released in a CD boxset with an extra live recording. We’re talking to Dominick at Hospital Records about eventually releasing a boxset for the <em>Sonno/Risveglio</em> series, which will include an extra record that was recorded at the time with the same instrumentation.</p>\n<p>There’s also a collaboration with Lawrence English that was recorded at my first Atonal Festival in 2016, which we’ve been meaning to release for a while now. We finally mastered it and it should be out this year. There’s also a Sonoio record, which is my song-based project that I sort of abandoned, but I recorded a full record and finally things have lined up where I feel I can take it off my hard drive and give it to the people that want to listen to it. And I finished a new record, which I finished just before moving to Berlin, because I didn’t know if I’d have a studio here immediately, but that probably won’t be out until 2019, because I’d like to have a show ready for it. I’m very excited to start performing it because it’s quite different from what I’ve done so far. It’ll be me, obviously, but I need to do things a little differently every time. Mostly though, I’m just excited for summer in Berlin.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s8iS2CuMYQw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n",

    "content": "<p>Ryuichi Sakamoto and Carsten Nicolai, aka Alva Noto, first met around 1997. It was something of a chance meeting, while Nicolai was on his first trip to Japan. Following an initial remix from Nicolai, the collaboration lead from to album after album – in total, they have written five LPs together, and toured extensively. Their work came to a halt between 2011 and 2015, in part due to Sakamoto's battle with cancer, but also as they felt their collaboration creatively exhausted.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to 2016 and they were united once again, enjoying the shine of having composed the soundtrack to BAFTA-winning survival epic, <em>The Revenant</em>. The reunion marked a clear departure from their previous work sonically, and in <a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/interviews/test-channel-alva-noto-interview\">an interview</a> earlier this year, Nicolai revealed that they had decided to &quot;step into completely new territory&quot;. Subsequently, they produced <em>Glass</em>, recorded in Philip Johnson's Glass House. The album is largely improvised, Sakamoto and Nicolai more or less trading places as Nicolai experimented with traditional instruments while Sakamoto took control of electronics, using contact mics to harness the natural reverberations of the structure.</p>\n<p>It was this work which provided the inspiration for the duo's recent performance at the Barbican Centre, <em>Two</em>. While the improvisational aspect was curtailed to some degree, there were indeed moments of complete role-reversal. Nicolai began the performance with string bow in hand, generating eerie resonances from a set of crotales. Sakamoto complemented these textures, leaning into his piano casing to generate an array of oddball sound effects. At one point he produced a sheet of cellophane, crumpling it next to the microphone in a piece of Masayoshi Fujita-style live musique concrète.</p>\n<p>For the most part however, the duo stuck to their usual placements, Nicolai standing stoically behind a laptop mounted podium like a runaway Kraftwerk member, while Sakamoto sat painting delicate, otherworldly piano melodies. Nicolai has always had a propensity for sounds at the extreme ends of the frequency spectrum, and this evening was no different. But between the crevasse-dwelling low-end, ultrasound hums and tinnitus-pitch sine tones, Sakamoto spattered the sonic canvas with graceful, introspective motifs, meandering with supple fluidity.</p>\n<p>They sat at a distance through the performance, almost appearing to be working in isolation. In a sense, perhaps they are. Indeed, there has always been something paradoxical about the collaboration – on the one hand, Nicolai creates sounds which feel cold and scientific, while Sakamoto's compositions are tender, dreamlike and richly emotive. It's a magical blend of clinical and spiritual all at once — an arctic warmth if you will.</p>\n<p><em>Check out some footage from their performance at The Glass House, below.</em></p>\n<div style=\"padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/191205737?color=ffffff&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js\"></script>\n",

    "content": "<p>I first encountered Manchester's Henrietta Smith-Rolla, aka Afrodeutsche, DJing at London's Somerset House. She was playing at an event themed around algorithmic parties, virtual dancefloors and the interplay between London and Manchester's nightlife. Her set delivered an amphetamine-charged hour of thudding breaks and heady, space-station psychedelia, playful, yet well in tune with the gig's future-focused approach.</p>\n<p>Since then, it appears she has been rather busy. Her debut album, <em>Break Before Make</em>, saw its release at the end of last month on Skam, an enterprise which has been similarly forward-looking, ever since its establishment in 1990. Releasing works by a young Sean Booth and Rob Brown, now better known together as Autechre, as well as the likes of Boards of Canada, Freeform and Jega, Skam have championed artists with an ear for the unconventional.</p>\n<p>This latest release features an inebriated mix of low-slung electro-futurism and distant melodic abstractions. At times, the album recalls the unsettled synthesiser compositions of Wendy Carlos, reminding us of her soundtracks for films like <em>A Clockwork Orange</em> and <em>Tron</em>. The yearning arpeggios and majestic crescendos of 'And!' are case in point, as are those of 'The Middle Middle', which builds to a sickly-sweet climax atop stuttered drum sequences.</p>\n<p>At other points, <em>Break Before Make</em> feels better referenced among SEGA Mega Drive classics in terms of its melodic qualities, tracks like 'OD' or 'You Heard Me The First Time' evoking early-90s console nostalgia. 'Now What' is another favourite in this regard, pointed melodies and machine-funk basslines working into a muscular groove.</p>\n<p>For the most part however, the album is engineered for the dancefloor. There is the drexciyan motorik of 'Work It', while 'Day Tuner' is a glacial 909 half-stepper, tumbling melodics and spattered snares working together in hypnagogic sway. 'Start Again Part Four' on the other hand is well aligned to Skam's lengthy back-catalogue of Gescom releases, modulated arpeggios and squelching reverberations working into a small-hours antarctic mindbender, packed with brooding intensity.</p>\n<p>The Afrodeutsche project grew from a search for Smith-Rolla's biological father, in which she discovered her Ghanaian roots also included German and Russian heritage. As far as I can tell, <em>Break Before Make</em> marks her first dispatch from the alias, yet it's clear the album was born from years of honing her craft – that point where technical nous becomes mere intuition. She performs live regularly, and this album could equally be one of those sessions, unpacking ideas carefully and exploring their range with unrestricted imagination.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TgzO1BsXLfI?rel=0&controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>Ghamccccxc vRR</em>, the latest album from Yannick Pozo Vento, aka Réelle, has echoes of works by the likes of Lotic, Obsequies or Arca. This said, the work exercises some deeply personal conflicts. “Most of these sounds, as well as the album title, were created during psychosis without me consciously knowing what I’m doing&quot;, Vento states of the album's construction. &quot;Therefore I also can’t remember when or why I wrote down <em>Ghamccccxc vRR</em> on a piece of paper.”</p>\n<p>There is certainly a sensate, stream-of-consciousness feel to the LP. This is heightened by the fact Vento uses maverick synthesis techniques which allow them to use pens, brushes and other handheld artistic tools to literally paint melodies. 'Head Held High' is a particularly interesting listen, haunting Theremin-style modulations warble between erratic life-support machine blasts of glitch and staggered marching snares.</p>\n<p>There are hints of the celestial too, through Vento's tasteful additive synthesis abstractions and heavily processed vocals. These range from melancholic alien ballads like 'Floating' to the acrid 'Pink' or Gábor Lázár reminiscent 'Unfold'. At other points Vento's productions recontextualise the club with uncanny subversion. 'Fluid Metals' is a personal favourite — vaporous drones take on a seductive quality nestled beneath brittle, plastic-tone atmospherics and penetrating stabs of low-end.</p>\n<p>Released on Aïsha Devi's Danse Noire imprint, <em>Ghamccccxc vRR</em> is a fearless exploration into the subconscious - an intimate, and deeply individual work. After receiving a medical diagnosis for schizophrenia shortly after their first episode of psychosis, Vento felt impelled to fully commit to a queer, genderfluid lifestyle, something that impacted their decision to move to Berlin and oppose &quot;conservative energies&quot; with their art as fully as possible. This latest work does a masterful job.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/435412440&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Almost all music is said to 'sound better live'. Whether its for sing-along choruses or sheer volume, music seems best heard in the here-and-now. Of course, this is the 'original context' for music. The notion of recorded sound is an historical anomaly. The first sound recording was made in 1878 but up until then, music was an ephemeral experience. There was no possibility of re-playing or re-living a beloved performance other than through the channels of memory. Before recorded music, you may only hear your favourite symphonic piece once or twice in a lifetime. But then, part of the beauty of live performance is that it doesn't last.</p>\n<p>I've often thought that techno is one of the few genres for which this is really true. Techno itself is known for its anonymity. DJs play 'tracks', not 'songs'. They play to facilitate a vibe, not a karaoke backing track. In the case of techno, the emphasis on live experience is so important that it has almost become pastiche. The common lived experience of techno involves a good E, shared water-bottles, and good old fashioned skin-on-skin bonding. It is music to be heard in a shared space, with a democracy of dancers.</p>\n<p>Manni Dee built his reputation precisely on this experience. His live shows take the hallmarks of techno and pushes them to the extreme. The kicks are louder than the ear can bear, the dynamic tensions rise and fall like a rollercoaster. It may therefore come as some surprise that his debut LP, <em>The Residue</em>, makes a marked departure from the world of club techno. This debut LP, on the legendary Tresor imprint, offers instead a series of sonic experiments stretching across a vast pool of influences.</p>\n<p><em>The Residue</em> seems to synthesise Manni Dee's experience in techno clubs with an affinity for dark-ambient, for which he has become known through his <a href=\"http://www.straylandings.co.uk/news/premiere-nuances-on-tabernacle\">Nuances</a> project. This comes through on tracks like 'The Eye of Shepherdess' or 'At Mercy of the Muse', which sound like the introspective experiments of Throbbing Gristle. But 'Subterranean Choke', 'Paroxysm' and 'Smut' all work as 5am club body-shakers. There is an engaging tension at the heart of <em>The Residue</em> between these two poles, between isolation and union; mind and matter. The title of the album's first track describes it best: as an album best heard, 'In Communal Solitude'.</p>\n<p>To celebrate the release of <em>The Residue</em> we asked Manni Dee to contribute to our That Time When series, listing his four most memorable gigs...</p>\n<p>###House of God, Tunnel Club, Birmingham _ 2016</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/921/43202948271_3ece167539_h.jpg\" alt=\"x\"></p>\n<p>This was somewhat of a homecoming, as I was born and raised just down the road in Wolverhampton. Both Surgeon and Makaton had told me great things about HOG, and it just so happened I was on the promoters radar. Karenn had to pull out so I swooped in as a replacement. My expectations were surpassed. The way the night was curated was particularly impressive. Techno in the main room, drum and bass in the top room and house and disco in the back room. The diversity of the crowd, age, gender and ethnicity, was something that struck me straight away. It ranged from the debauched who’d been to every HOG event for the last 23 years, and the soon to be stained first-timers. Also, it was a halloween party, so the effort people put in to their costumes made it extra special. Another thing I loved about this gig was Zit, the in house MC, goading the crowd and making use of his potty mouth throughout my set.</p>\n<p>###Album launch at Tresor, Berlin _ 2018</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1828/43202947541_afa06e7730_h.jpg\" alt=\"xx\"></p>\n<p>It’s a privilege to play Tresor on any occasion, but when it’s your album launch that privilege becomes an honour. Both Gaja before me and Domenico Crisci after me played brilliant sets. I played live for an hour, all hardware plus the inclusion of a megaphone with a lapel mic attached to the front, which I used, like Zit before me, to provoke the crowd and shout expletives. Occasionally the lapel mic would detach so I could hold it in my hand and move and jump around while using it. I spent a few days in Berlin after the show, the perfect way to celebrate the album release.</p>\n<p>###Unpolished at Warehouse Elementenstraat, Amsterdam _ 2018</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/916/43153402662_5d87bc9d77_b.jpg\" alt=\"xxx\"></p>\n<p>Me and Ewa Justka played live together for the second time, this time in Amsterdam at Unpolished. Playing live as a duo gives you more time to hone in on the elements you’re in control of as the workload is distributed. We controlled about two or three machines each, and everything was pretty much improvised. I wouldn’t say our sets together are conceptually driven, but there’s definitely a focus on pressure, both through sound and lights. The two day festival was great. With the line up being so big I got to spend a lot of time with my extended techno family who I don’t often get to see because of our tour schedules. Closing the first night meant we could enjoy the second without any pressure or anticipation of playing. We definitely took advantage\nof that, from what I remember and from what people have told me.</p>\n<p>###Blur, Newhampton Arts Centre, Wolverhampton _ 2015</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1823/43202948831_1b0b99a57c_h.jpg\" alt=\"xxxx\"></p>\n<p>This gig was special for a few reasons. First of all, Blur are one of my favourite bands, second, the gig was held at Newhampton Arts Centre which is where Sam Sharpe (now known as Beats a Bar) was located, a studio I used to visit regularly in my teens. It was there where I was encouraged and guided by youth worker and studio engineer Keith ‘Spock’ Dilworth. I don’t think I’d be making music today if it weren’t for him. Third, the 300 capacity gig sold out in less than a minute, and I managed to grab two tickets (the benefits of being self-employed). The energy in the room was amazing, and so were Blur. I got to touch Albarn and might have cried twice.</p>\n<p><em>'The Residue' is out now on <a href=\"https://www.beatport.com/release/the-residue/2319662\">Tresor</a>.</em></p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Breakcore is one of those genres that you're not really supposed to like. At its most extreme, a breakcore track is a parade of production pyrotechnics and hall-of-mirrors sound transmogrification: a playground for the ear. It's main goal is one of spectacle, to the awe the listener with complexity. At the time of its development, many jungle-heads unfairly chastised breakcore for supposedly removing sounds (like the amen break) from their original context and placing them in a chin-strokey, undanceable performative extravaganza.</p>\n<p>Breakcore has therefore been often dismissed as a joke. But it’s one of the few genres that includes humour as one of its central themes. Simon Reynolds once wrote that Drill &amp; Bass (a genre often paired with breakcore) might be better named <em>Droll &amp; Bass</em>. Aphex Twin, Squarepusher and µ-Ziq all seemed to carry their British wit with them into the music they made. Consequently, the music was whimsical and fun, from Aphex's contorted face to Squarepusher's easily misheard lyrics on '<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13HM-bmKW2U\">Red Hot Car</a>'.</p>\n<p>But it's hard not to be impressed by breakcore's originality and technical depth. For many, myself included, breakcore was a great entry-point into electronic music because it sounded like nothing else in the world. I almost couldn't believe that it was possible to make music like this, and I spent hours on the Internet trying to figure out how a sound was achieved or what software to use. I was completely fascinated.</p>\n<p>But listening back to a lot of those early releases, it's clear that breakcore isn't all technical trickery. A lot of the time, under a lattice of digitally manipulated breakbeats, producers enshroud a hidden sweetness: an Easter-egg for you to savour, guilt-free. Take Aphex's '<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-M8sIzLNVT0\">Cock/Ver10</a>', which opens with some lush synthesised flutes before giving way to the infamous, 'come on you cunts let's have some Aphex acid!', like the musical equivalent of a clown squirting water out of a flower when you lean in to smell its fragrance.</p>\n<p>This latest mix from Calum Gunn compiles some of his favourite breakcore releases. Few will know that Gunn has produced a wealth of breakcore under his <a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/artist/304756-Acrnym\">Acrnym</a> moniker, a project Gunn describes as his &quot;shady past&quot;.

    "content": "<p>The DIY industrial imprint, Contort Yourself, have returned with a curious EP from the Brazilian producer, Innsyter. Contort Yourself have always intrigued me for being a label that does music like post-punk, only more so. Their sound palette covers analogue overdrive, cassette warble, and vintage echo, and the label itself describes their sound in true post-punk simplicity, &quot;expressing the sound of darkness and frustration through use of machines&quot;. Even the name, Contort Yourself, brings to mind the destructive impulse of Orange Juice's <em>Rip It Up</em> or The Slit's <em>Cut</em>.</p>\n<p>But the label diverges from the hallmarks of the 80s underground in its contemporaneous use of electronics. Their latest release, <em>Magnetic Healing</em>, is an excellent example of this. It sounds at once both forgotten and futuristic, like a knackered mix-tape found on mars. The label itself describes the EP's opening ‘Desintegrado’ as sounding like, “an industrial dub punk trying to channel early Cluster or Moebius and strangely succeeding”. The strangeness of its sound is unmistakable. The beats and the arpeggios merge into one another to create an odd-shaped mush. But there is plenty of groove in there if you listen carefully.</p>\n<p><em>'Magnetic Healing' will be released on 23rd July with <a href=\"http://www.contortyourself.co.uk/\">Contort Yourself</a>.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/466485666%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-b4lgs&color=%23949494&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Wunmi Onibudo</em></p>\n<p>In the late Renaissance, the once ethereal spacing of chords became suddenly earthen and aurally muddied with the invention of the harpsichord. Choirs were automated by a single playing hand, and onlookers lucky enough to see this instrument up close discovered that harmony was in fact clearer than ever, visually mapped out by the movements of fingers carving shapes upon keys. For those who tried to theorise the ways in which music might be a prayer for the future, the harpsichord was an ascetic hymn to connect being with heaven. Gaping mouths were replaced by delicate fingers parsing wooden notes and the eyes not the ears were newly tasked with trying to understand what sacredness sounded like.</p>\n<p>Perhaps inspired by the image of a hand striking out all melodic voices at once, Francesco Giorgi authored <em>De Harmonia Mundi</em> in which he described music as a substance akin to the tiniest building blocks of life, and the forms which make such music as an ideal geometry to attune one’s mind to the mind of God. Sonic architecture became an allegory for the creation of the universe and all its inhabitants. Almost five centuries later, Warwick University’s Cybernetic Culture Research Unit (CCRU) indulged in the occult status of Giorgi’s writing, transferring its metaphor from God to an all-powerful artificial intelligence. Nefarious philosopher Nick Land labelled this AI presence <em>Gnon</em>, and spearheaded the theorising of what might be considered <em>ideal forms of technology as allegories for the destruction of the human-centric universe</em>. Numerology, shape, and the four-four of machine music became the sound to attune one’s body to the end of the world. Philosophy as salvation was reframed as philosophy from the perspective of the end of the Human, and the harpsichord functioned as a sonic precursor for those who wished to accelerate the automation of the body to increasingly delicate and intricate invention.</p>\n<p>On a balmy sold-out night at The Barbican Centre, I see composer Daniel Lopatin perform as Oneohtrix Point Never with his all-star live band. This performance, a faithful execution of Lopatin’s latest album, <em>Age Of</em>, draws formal destruction and creation full circle. Harpsichords and hammered keys of all kinds in functional beautifully ornate harmony, sound out in tandem with distorted mouth sounds, and voices speaking lines of text from 90’s occult theory. I introduce both Francesco Giorgi and Nick Land, not only because their spectres hang over this performance, but because I think their polar opposite takes on the importance of telling stories through sound, provide an important backdrop for Lopatin’s incredible and wildly original music. Lopatin’s work has a tension to it — it sounds life-giving and inspiring, there to provide critique, but the narratives Lopatin frequently give his music, allegories and metaphors he shoves upon sound and his audience, are politically muddy at best, and disingenuous at their worst.</p>\n<p>###I. Creation <br></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;...As shows like <em>Black Mirror</em> function less as a warning, and more as a Silicon Valley R&amp;D department, critical art needs to be explorative rather than exaggerative...&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From the performance’s opening we are treated to an act of profound creation. What is heard is easily Lopatin’s most original sound to date. <em>Age Of</em> is startlingly unique. The key to this originality comes from the refined way Lopatin combines a selection of common and recognisable instrumental sounds. Forget the legacy of referential music he’s become known for, 'The Station', (a pop ballad originally written for Usher) combines clean electric bass with harp, and plectrumed acoustic guitar, auto-tuned voice, dulcimer, regal horns and out-of-kilt mournful synth to an effect which in my opinion is as close as we are gonna get to an orchestration for the sick gods of 2018. Tracks like 'Toys 2' are composed with complete confidence, Lopatin is at the peak of his practice. Those many layers of reference found in earlier Oneohtrix releases are still there, but they may as well be ignored. In <em>Age Of</em>, I feel like the sound is just him, these timbres are wholly his domain now.</p>\n<p>I fell in love with the sound of <em>Age Of</em> when I first heard it alone in my bedroom, however seeing how it sounded live at the Barbican was another level of experience. Like those who first glimpsed the fingers of a harpsichordist expressing the uniform shape of chords on keys, I felt like seeing that General Midi Sound Lopatin is famed for, played live in front of me by four incredible musicians, brought Lopatin’s compositions into clarity. The density of the music became crystal. Percussionist Eli Kreszler wriggled around his extended kit of rim shots and bongos, hollow skinned instruments which awed us as they slipped from bubbly and plastic to metallic and gravelly.</p>\n<p>OK, live music should hopefully always connect a listener with an extra element of how it was composed, but Lopatin’s music has intentionally never felt real for me. It’s been sounding out of headphones up in an unreal place, a parallel history. At the Barbican, after a standing ovation, the band come out for an encore and pianist Kelly Moran, in perfect precision, strikes the arpeggiating burst of piano midi from <em>R Plus 7</em>’s incredible 'Chrome Country'. Seeing her fingers bring computer music into reality, made me reconsider the images Lopatin surrounds his music with. Moment to moment, the quality of the sound itself played IRL, was always there to answer any fears I had for the album’s broader politics.</p>\n<p>To describe this sound and talk of its political connotations, some have called <em>Age Of</em> ‘medieval cyberpunk’, instead, I’d prefer to describe it as (if you’ll indulge me) the sound of Haute Baroque Capitalism. When Lopatin posted on YouTube in 2009 under the name Sunset Corp his vaporwave functioned as a critical soundtrack for the consumerist ghosts of the past. Today, his music haunts the future. Rather than playing the jester with kitsch time-stretched samples, his recent work is expressed with a certain playful seriousness. The opening track of the performance, also titled <em>Age Of</em>, is a virtuosic montage, an elaborate ode to the end of human history. As the track comes to its end Nate Boyce’s accompanying visuals depict the earth itself becoming particulate.  While the music is extravagant in form, thematically it has even stronger ties to the 17th century. The reformation in Loptain’s work is a shift from his once veiled romanticism, to a new honesty without excessive layers of irony. The sentiment here is distraught, yet lovingly so — always drama-filled.</p>\n<p>Toby Shorin has an excellent essay entitled <em>Haute Baroque Capitalism</em>. Within, he compares the architecture of excess seen in family photos of the Trumps, to the curly aesthetic of Baroque lettering on deconstructed club music releases and faux-progressive parties. The decoration within Trump Tower, in bad taste, is one of intricate self-decadence. Shorin likens the architecture of too-much-money to theorist Gean Moreno’s <a href=\"https://subpixel.space/entries/haute-baroque-capitalism/\">descriptions of a capitalism</a> which leaves in its wake an, “Alien monstrosity, an insatiable Thing that appropriates the energy of everything it touches and, in the process, propels the world toward the inorganic.” While cogent, I simultaneously see the reverse: money, ungodly money becoming an organic living organism, becoming ornamentation alive and grotesque on the sides of bulging skyscrapers. At the show, the two sculptures hanging on either side of the Barbican’s stage, also made by Nate Boyce, remind me of such gold-leafed uncontrollable growths. In Lopatin’s musical language, of contrast, of running clavichord scales and sublime pretty melodies interspersed with chaos, I find no better soundtrack to the disgusting aliveness we have experienced through the political, ecological, and technological disasters of the new millennium. Lopatin has always excelled at making a music which is perfect for listeners to a-latch their glib but necessary material metaphors of our information age. The references are all here at the Barbican — the consumer culture run amok, the forbidden VHS, the haunted past, the retrofuture, the screams of the demonetised child content creator — but a question sticks in my throat: are these references politically <em>necessary</em> anymore?</p>\n<p>###II. Destruction <br></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;...Revelling in the End of the World is seen to be far more fun than being scared of it...&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The old debates around successful critique in art have see-sawed between two camps: art which critiques by reflecting and warning us of disasters to come; and art which critiques by hammering and showing us an alternative to a better world. For all my love of Oneohtrix releases, the thing that has disturbed me the most has been their surprising lack of speculative imagination. Lopatin has made his name creating music which <em>mirrors</em> the debased state of the world. Prior releases have indulged in hyper-commercial sci-fi tropes of the future: pink flesh piles, laser guns, Nickelodeon slime and the time-warp of human history absorbed by the omniscient computer with the neon light. Lopatin’s complacent visions of the future are frequently paired with a belief that <em>through</em> an exaggeration of these visions, image and sound become transgressive, and therefore radical. His collaborative track with Jon Rafman, Beta Male (which premiered on 4chan) is an excellent example of this thinking: a worst hits of the Internet played out in flashing strobe images of furry pornography and grime-filled keyboards. If the intention was to hold up a mirror to male online culture, then instead of looking away in horror, the boys looked on in perverse fascination, indulging in their own self-debasement. I’ve written in other places of the protective mechanisms of irony (and transgression) within cultures like 4chan, but it’s worth repeating here: critique via performative exaggeration never works as intended. Playing into the extremes of a violent culture, inspires new violence.</p>\n<p>In a 2018 where William Gibson dystopias become blueprints for reality, and where cyberpunk classics become playgrounds for the right-wing to revel in libertarian futures, I had high hopes for Daniel Lopatin to buck the trend. As shows like <em>Black Mirror</em> function less as a warning, and more as a Silicon Valley R&amp;D department, critical art needs to be explorative rather than exaggerative. On first listen, <em>Age Of</em> struck me as a more imaginative, less macho, more honest and more playful direction for Lopatin. The track Warning marks out its critical position clearly, and his new music is alive with a certain future optimism. Instead of just mirroring present conditions, for me this music was finally on the edge of providing some sort of alternative, an exit. Unfortunately, days after the release, the album’s tonal content was tainted by Lopatin’s words. In an interview with <a href=\"http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/39904/1/oneohtrix-point-never-age-of-interview\">DAZED</a> he name dropped the trendy CCRU, and outlined his narrative for the album: artificial intelligence gods chill-out by the ruins of our destroyed world, looking back on the follies of humanity and longing to be dumb and idiotic like us. This narrative is disappointing. Besides being way too easy, the teenage coolness and distance Lopatin hangs onto only muddies the politics of such a future vision. To be an idiot here is to be innocent. Lopatin evokes a future where the machines we construct find the immorality of human nature seductive — though farce, his criticality becomes farcical.  Revelling in the End of the World is seen to be far more fun than being scared of it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1769/29558569278_981fabb0e0_b.jpg\" alt=\"x\">\n<em>Photo by Anna Louise Yorke</em></p>\n<p>First reviews of <em>Myriad</em> and <em>Age Of</em> endlessly praise the dystopian vision of Lopatin. Apparently, by showing us his intricate and dark vision of the future, it will help prevent such a future coming to be. Instead, as history shows us, we should be fearful that the reverse might occur, that <em>revelling in dystopia might bring about dystopia</em>. Unsurprisingly, this is a tenant of Nick Land and the CCRU. A text like Meltdown from Land’s collection of essays, <em>Fanged Noumena</em>, is seductive in nearly the exact same ways as Lopatin’s work. Land writes:</p>\n<p><em>〔〔 〕〕 The infrastructure of power is human neurosoft compatible ROM. Authority instantiates itself as linear instruction pathways, genetic baboonery, scriptures, traditions, rituals, and gerontocratic hierarchies, resonant with the dominator ur-myth that the nature of reality has already been decided. If you want to find ICE, try thinking about what is blocking you out of the past. It certainly isn't a law of nature. Temporalization decompresses intensity, installing constraint. 〔〔 〕〕</em></p>\n<p>This performative language is ornate, cyber-baroque if you will, intentionally so as to hide meaning behind its surface aesthetic. Land’s writing replaces rococo godliness with curlicued abject and pessimistic fascination. Future speculation is treated with market logic. Pop- neologisms are committed to the page as causal objects to sell to the disenfranchised student. Here the selling point is one of the most seductive of all advertisers: a tapping into the darkness of teen-hood angst, and the offering of an antidote to this alienation — an ironic belief in destruction. In many ways I feel like <em>Age Of</em>’s seductive qualities are cut from the same cloth, only, the mediation occurs in the opposite direction. This music’s aesthetic, the aliveness I witness on stage, wears its meaning outwardly, and sadly, Lopatin smothers its potential beneath canned narratives. A smiling skeleton appears on screen as the band begin to play 'We’ll Take It'. Crunching out a slow tempo industrial beat, each is a hit to the stomach beneath a frantic voice which cries: “But we don’t even know what the price is!”. Lopatin chooses to end the song halfway. On the album, the second half of We’ll Take It is defined by a sweet hymn-like lead synth which opens the track out for a different more nuanced interpretation. In performance, instead, Lopatin decides to keep us in the dark, choosing to rely on Nate Boyce’s twisted childhood images of TV gore and mutilated bodies.</p>\n<p>The abject fascination of <a href=\"http://www.factmag.com/2015/11/12/oneohtrix-point-never-garden-of-delete-interview/\">snot on a used tissue</a>, of pubescent teen body fluid, does not translate well to a 2018 album about AI’s wanting to be boys on an Internet forum. The transgressive act — using a Nick Land quote, or a CCRU one — is not just bad because Lopatin is quoting a ‘politically incorrect’ neo-fascist philosopher, it’s bad because the type of future a reader distils from Lopatin’s words drowns out all the legitimately revolutionary thought behind the subjects CCRU once dealt with. The potential for inhuman intelligence to be an outsidedness to human destruction, the potential for automation to liberate us from the slavery of work, and the potential for a utopian future, become buried beneath DAZED one-liners. Movements inspired by CCRU, like left-wing Accelerationism, all but die out when they become caught up in the lightning-fast life and death cycles of art and music trends. I fear that in the future, the remains of these ideas will be aesthetic husks of the movement: fragmentation and speed, gooey CGI, and a dusty search-bar full of forgotten optimism.</p>\n<p>###III. Same <br></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;...Being pessimistic is still an imaginative act, and it can be put to good use...&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Undo us</em> <br>\n<em>Undo, undo us below</em> <br>\n<em>Same</em> <br>\n<em>As above</em> <br>\n<em>Undo, undo us below</em> <br>\n<em>Same</em> <br>\n<em>As above</em> <br>\n<em>Fool to dream machine to dust</em> <br>\n<em>Same</em> <br></p>\n<p>One of the highlights of the performance at the Barbican, and a track which gave me goosebumps when I first heard it, is a collaboration entitled 'Same', made with singer and composer Anohni. The repeated melody, sung like a mantra, has Anohni chant in a duet with a pitched-up version of her own voice. The accompaniment of breaking glass and mechanical crashes and screams, makes way for beautiful organ chords and then the contrastingly gentle sounds of a choir of voices. In interview, Lopatin describes this collaboration and track as the soundtrack for a future where we can no longer distinguish artificial intelligence from ourselves. Being one and the Same with a machine, tinged with optimism, is of course a poetic and moving position. However, the ramifications of such a thought are actually pretty boring, and disingenuous to what Lopatin revealingly goes on to further say:</p>\n<p><em>“She [Anhoni] challenged me and urged me to think about what I had said, and to maybe think about what’s happening [dystopia] in a different way. And I did. So I think that a lot of the compulsive imagery and sketching of the Anthropocene that happens on the record has to do with that conversation, and it has to do with me being honest with myself about now, and that endpoint, and bridging them together in a poetic way.”</em></p>\n<p>The signs are here in Lopatin’s new music that he has indeed thought about the end of the world in a different, and honest way. I label him disingenuous however, because I think the package he surrounds this new sound with is a stale vision of tomorrow. Nate Boyce’s visuals betray the new direction of Lopatin’s sound. The pressure to hang onto fan-favourite tropes from his previous album <em>Garden of Delete</em>, should have been ignored. The Barbican’s asymmetrical screens displaying the warped bodies of some- could be 80’s children’s TV show, make me want for an end to retrofuturism. As Benjamin Noys writes: “What we don’t manufacture any more is the future. Instead we dwell in a generalised nostalgia…” In Boyce’s case, he dwells in something worse — a transgressive nostalgia.</p>\n<p>The track 'Same' also infers a world where we can no longer distinguish between creation and destruction. In many ways, the described <em>sameness</em> of humans and AIs is a position of passivity. Nick Land is famous for his ardent belief in ‘anti-praxis’. He writes theory which in effect strives to sit back, to display a passiveness towards politics, and instead await the doom within the belief that destruction is the inevitable end point for human civilisation. I’m not sure whether Lopatin still identifies as a Nihilist, but this pessimism he displays towards the future doesn’t necessarily have to be a distancing feeling. Instead of responding to ugly feelings with coldness, irony, and a kind of SoCal chillness, a legitimate fear for the future can and should be responded to with heat. ‘Anti-praxis’, and passiveness, is inherently a faulty position because it tries to ignore, rather than negate the very heart of active political theory. Frankfurt-school praxis is in essence, an awakening of class consciousness through the process of simply imagining a future. Being pessimistic is still an imaginative act, and it can be put to good use.</p>\n<p>While watching Lopatin’s performance, I found the greatest pleasure in speculating how he himself imagined writing this music. I pictured him in the act of pressing the key on a synth, in the act of changing a parameter on Ableton, and he himself in the act of imagining how this change of timbre or sound might affect his music’s potential. The care, the refinement, the decision to include his own singing voice in his music and to sing for us on stage with three other excellent musicians, is the real honesty and praxis of this performance. Lopatin has talked of his compositional practice as a kind of ‘compressionism’, that is, a process of trying to compress all the disparate and wild online and offline signals of 2018. The narratives he gives his music rest on the notion that to describe tomorrow, we should compress today. Compression is a flattening, a broadening out, and that which it mirrors is therefore also muddied and squashed within the work of art. The real challenge is to instead do the opposite, to encourage social consciousness by uncompressing the driving forces of capitalism, making them understandable, and giving audible and visible space to figure out why some of us already live in dystopian conditions.</p>\n<p>Within the architecture of The Barbican Centre, a utopian project of the past, it was a special moment to see music I once thought was inseparable from the Internet, newly expressed romantically and convincingly on stage. The effect was powerful and the players were assiduous. The harmony of telling a story through sound, what to say outside of it and what not to, is a project for further consideration. Still, the seeds are there: the longing to find a sonic architecture for a world in need.</p>\n<p><em>Emile Frankel's forthcoming book, 'Hearing the Cloud', will be out with <a href=\"http://www.zero-books.net/\">Zero Books</a> later this year.</em></p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Paul Régimbeau, aka Mondkopf, is a producer I had come to associate with some of the most corrupt techno I’d ever heard. Together with Guillaume Heuguet, he founded In Paradisum in 2011, quietly championing a basement-dwelling, tape-chewed approach to dancefloor genres. Their catalogue includes early output from the likes of Low Jack and Qoso, not to mention Régimbeau’s own productions, charged with distorted post-punk angst.</p>\n<p>His new collaborative project, ‘Good Luck In Death’, with Lebanese artist Charbel Haber would suggest something of a spiritual rebirth has taken place. In comparison, their <em>They Promised Us a Bright Future, We Were Content with an Obscure Past</em> release is a cathartic, sermon-like listen, a quietly emotive exploration into psychotropic epiphanies. 'Mystery Malaise and Eternal Spleen' makes for an ethereal opener, cascading synthscapes and imposing drones working to a tremoring, introspective close.</p>\n<p>'Fortune Telling Breeze' on the other hand calls to mind the unsettled kosmische and grinding slow-motion electronics of Klaus Schulze or Tangerine Dream, sun-basked power-ambient enveloping the listener in a blanket of stretched-out choral textures. Meanwhile, 'Unforgettable Cabaret Nights' creates a spine-tingling Lovecraftian narrative, warbling organ tones and swirling melancholia drifting hazily across the stereo-field.</p>\n<p>Régimbeau and Haber voyage deep into the inner psyche with this latest release, while maintaining a light touch in their treatment of acoustic and choral timbres. It is a subtle, patiently developing work, reminiscent of Popol Vuh's soundtracks for Werner Herzog films like <em>Heart of Glass</em> or <em>Aguirre, The Wrath of God</em>,  but carried off with their own unique sense of presence.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XhD5NARUI9k?rel=0&controls=0&showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>There is a feeling of new beginnings in the debut album from Sleepsang. The artwork shows an eager young boy standing on the lake’s shore with a stick in his hand, looking curiously into what is front of him, like a traveler. Throughout the album, the samples of water hitting a shore and their musical variations remind of water's ability to create a new life and its symbolic meaning as a pathway.</p>\n<p>Indeed, ‘crossing the waters’ is a motif found frequently in mythology. From Homeric Greece to Biblical Egypt, it signifies a process of transition into the underworld. The phrase ‘eternal memory’ is used in Eastern Orthodox church to pay respect to the dead and pray for soul to enter heaven. The death in the case of this album is not necessarily literal, but a way of denoting a change in a state of being. Sleepsang opens the album with ‘Corruption’, a name that refers to a process of irreversible decay, but is sonically executed to hint at rebirth. Overriding the track’s initial ambience, the beats build up adventurous melodies but quiet down only to resurface in a new place.</p>\n<p>A lot of ambient electronic music rests on similar principles due to its roots in drone. The characteristic monophonic sounds and translucent transitions are present throughout the album, but Sleepsang intertwines them with a multitude of details. ‘Submerged Electrical Cables’ is an interesting listen from the other side: lyrical piano and gentle croons transform into double bass and altered, sinister laughs. ‘Immortal Memory’ is build around clock-like ambient glitches in the continuous loop and a sense of urgency. ‘Spindelnät’ (Swedish for spider web) is as intricate as its name, with high-pitched sounds fluttering around its drone core.</p>\n<p>Released on Sheffield-based label Interworld, this record confidently stands out among others on its roster with its expressiveness. It utilises a multitude of sounds which playfully highlight each other, as the story develops and gains more depth. <em>Eternal Memory</em> is a beautiful debut and sets a confident ground for more.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4113566855/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://interworldmedia.bandcamp.com/album/eternal-memory\">Eternal Memory by Sleepsang</a></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>The independent website the Quietus is wonderfully persistent in covering unique, diverse and marginalised music. But as it struggles to compete with the Internet giants and mainstream publications, it is often <a href=\"http://thequietus.com/articles/25214-quietus-tenth-anniversary\">on the brink of going under</a>. Quite metaphorically, the website chose to celebrate its 10th anniversary at Corsica Studios - an essential gear of London’s underground nightlife, which is at risk of being pushed out of its home in Elephant &amp; Castle, because of the area’s commercial redevelopment. But last Friday we were celebrating, and at 11.30pm the party was already in full swing. Not wasting time to warm up, the crowd was firing crazy moves to unhinged techno, rock and even Alpine yodelling mixed by DJ Bus Replacement Service, who opened the main room in her signature Kim Jong-un costume.</p>\n<p>The line-up for the occasion reflected the bizarre and humorous music taste of the feted publication, and boasted some of the most exciting current artists. Booking multiple headliners is risky: an abundance of big names can make the audience feel anxious about missing out on some of the greats. But the night was flowing effortlessly and I found myself being exactly where I want to be and listening to exactly what I want to listen to at any given time. Following short and punchy live set by British Murder Boys, who were joined on stage by performance artists Nora Virus and Elliott Barnicle, we saw industrial techno legend Perc. As the club got packed during his set, Sophie Coletta in the second room was providing a much needed space to breath, without losing the boldness of harsher techno played in the main space.</p>\n<p>Shortly before his set, the co-founder of the Quietus, Luke Turner, was found grooving behind the decks next to Coletta with an open smile. He was pouring alcohol in the glass of a thirsty front row dancer and seemed happy to watch the guests enjoy themselves. Known and loved for its intimate feel, Corsica is also notorious for getting packed to an intolerable limit and the Quietus team deserves a praise for not letting the venue overcrowd. The atmosphere was dear and quoting one of the commentators on Resident Advisor, it was one of the most “non-dickhead crowds I've experienced in London”. Half an hour after scheduled closing time, KAOS's Choronzon was still teasing our tired bodies right up until the lights illuminated our smiley faces.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Max Zerrahn.</em></p>\n<p>Thomas Fehlmann is many things: synthesiser-cum-trumpeter for early post-punk band Palais Schaumburg, minimal techno pioneer with the likes of Juan Atkins and Mortiz von Oswald, and of course a member of the Orb. But Fehlmann’s solo work is sadly less well known, although to my mind the strongest of all his output.</p>\n<p>Fehlmann’s music has always appealed to me for a very simple reason: it <em>swings</em>. It may sound obvious but little techno makes use of swing in such a way. In some of his more mind-altering tracks, the swing is enough to throw you off balance, to wrong-foot the listener into a new rhythmical gait. What gives Fehlmann's beats their distinctiveness and longevity is the use of space <em>between</em> hits. Listen, for example, to how the rhythm slides into a new foothold on tracks like ‘<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpCXYIuQK6U\">Superbock</a>’ from his brilliant <em>Visions of Blah</em> LP.</p>\n<p>When listening to his work, it’s unsurprising that he draws influence from the Stones Throw crew and hip-hop in general. Producers like J Dilla and Madlib use tricks like these to stretch rhythms out of convention. The well-trodden 1-2-3-4 sequence of standardised rhythm becomes a warped matrix with which to play. Move the snare to an 'unstable' position, and suddenly everything is possible. Applying this approach from hip-hop, of freeing oneself from the tyranny of the 'quantise' button, Fehlmann gives techno a much needed lease of life. After all, if you ain’t got the funk then what have you got?</p>\n<p>After nearly four decades in the game, Fehlmann described the process of writing his latest LP, <em>Los Lagos</em>, as ‘checking the juice’. An artist so entrenched in collaboration must struggle to produce solo work, especially after eight years since his last solo record, <em>Gute Luft</em>. To celebrate the release of his new record, we caught up with Fehlmann last week to discuss plants, J Dilla, and the legacy of techno.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=359330282/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=f171a2/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=3877077707/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://thomasfehlmann.bandcamp.com/album/los-lagos\">Los Lagos by Thomas Fehlmann</a></iframe>\n<p><strong>Hi Thomas, how has your summer been?</strong></p>\n<p>In Berlin, we can’t complain. The only thing that is worrying for us is the drought for the plants. It’s been super dry, the driest I have ever experienced in Berlin. I suppose it’s the climate change.</p>\n<p><strong>I understand you’ve been making some music for plants too?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, funny you should say that. I was asked to do some piece but the botanical gardens in Phoenix, Arizona. It’s going to be installed in the next couple of weeks. I took ‘botanical gardens’ as a kind exotic inspiration — I am eager to be in conversation about plants because they are an important pastime of mine. I like the idea of music being surrounded by nature, or nature being surrounded by music.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m interested in how nature has influenced your sound. Your brand of techno has always struck as being more ‘natural’ or ‘alive’ than some of the more industrial contemporaries.</strong></p>\n<p>I take this as a compliment, thank you [laughs]. This is my take on it: I am always trying to make groovy stuff, and my interest in nature allows for the techno to be a little bit… softer. I just go where the vibe takes me, and I am often entertained by techno that has swing and groove and funk and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>Techno is often seen as a genre of convention — from classics synths to the formalistic structure of DJ tools. But I often feel like your music is more rebellious than that.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah that’s how it came into my life. I wanted to push against existing boundaries. After all the ‘boundaries’ are usually imagined, they’re not really there. So I want to have a close look at these hidden boundaries, and whack them about!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1892/42866905170_0498facc54_h.jpg\" alt=\"v\">\n<em>Photo by Max Zerrahn.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Do you find traditional electronic instruments limiting in that sense? Is it harder to produce swing with a drum machine?</strong></p>\n<p>No — it ain’t [laughs]. With drum machines in the 90s, you even had a special button to actually adjust the swing. These days, I obviously use machines and synthesisers but in a way Ableton Live is the main source of controlling, developing, hacking up sound. That gives me a pretty broad control of producing ‘natural grooves’. You don’t have to quantise if you don’t want. I like sound that flows and slides around. Think about J Dilla, for example. He made some of the grooviest beats of all time, but he didn’t care for the quantise grid. It was an amazing experience hearing Dilla for the first time, it was like an approval of the kind of sound I had been after for years! Some of those beats give me goosebumps.</p>\n<p><strong>Madlib is another one.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah — I love his work. I included some in my <a href=\"https://www.xlr8r.com/podcasts/podcast-552-thomas-fehlmann\">recent mix for XLR8R</a>. I actually had the chance of meeting the man a few times. We had an artist chat at one point for a magazine. He actually turned out to one of my gigs in LA, that was kinda hot…</p>\n<p><strong>Do you record your takes live, where does that ‘live feel’ come from?</strong></p>\n<p>If I do some sequences on an old hardware machine, like an old Korg, I do treat them like a sample. I’ll cut things out, re-quantise… What I don’t like is this idea of sitting in front of a keyboard and playing a melody, so I’ll always try to fool myself into making melodies out of samples of my own playing. I got quite frustrated with this traditional concept of sitting down and playing a line of music. My fingers don’t surprise me any more. So I always rely on process to get a structure going, to get some melodic content.</p>\n<p><strong>Is that down to ‘happy accidents’ then?</strong></p>\n<p>Well you set parameters for yourself, and these parameters cause mistakes, some of which sound very good. I teach a class of students at the moment, and the main theme of the class is ‘happy accidents’ [laughs]. We do group improvisation, which is a rare thing in electronic music today. We sit around a table and do ‘rounds’. A ‘round’ includes every member of the group possessing a simple noise or tone or sound-element. We wouldn’t know what our neighbours would do, but we would nonetheless fire off our individual sounds in a round after one an other. After a while, you build a foundation of happy accidents, and this is very fertile ground for new ideas.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you incorporate these ideas into your collaborative work?</strong></p>\n<p>When do I collaborations, such as my recent work with Terrence Dixon, I much prefer sitting together in a shared space instead of sharing files over the Internet. I tend to listen to music differently when there is two pairs of ears in the room. In the case of The Orb with Alex Paterson, we also worked really fast because we had a good understanding of what we were doing and very little need for questions between each other. There was a natural flow and that is something I really enjoy.</p>\n<p><strong>Are you planning any more Orb stuff in the future?</strong></p>\n<p>Well who knows — never say ‘never’, right? It’s clear that Alex [Paterson] chose to go in a direction that doesn’t necessarily match so well with my intentions. It just became a question of where flexibility would become compromise. I wasn’t quite up for that and it was just very obvious that I couldn’t help him with what his fantasies were. So I therefore thought it would be better to let him follow his dreams, and I mine. This happened before with the Orb: there were always phases where we were closer, and phases where we were further apart. As long as you’re able to handle it in a grown-up way, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1874349618/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=e99708/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=1811760119/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://thomasfehlmann.bandcamp.com/album/gute-luft\">Gute Luft by Thomas Fehlmann</a></iframe>\n<p><strong>I was very excited to see that you had done some work with Lee ‘Scratch’ Perry.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah [laughs]. That was out a series working with Alex’s main influences. It was clearly Alex who brought that idea to the table. It was also good that I was involved because he was so star struck [laughs]. Obviously I have big respect for the man but I didn’t find it difficult to talk to him. He came round our house in the countryside, we sent ourselves a week to work, we expected to do maybe 4-5 tracks but we all got so fired up that we made two albums’ worth of music.</p>\n<p><strong>People must be very jealous of that.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah well when you’re in the middle of the storm, you don’t notice the wind around it [laughs].</p>\n<p><strong>You described the making of your new album as ‘checking the juice’, what does that mean?</strong></p>\n<p>Well ‘the juice’ is like the most precious thing you have — the juice from a flower or an orange. Checking the juice is just seeing how much sugar essence or orange juice is left, you know? Another analogy would be ‘kicking the tyres’: you kick the tyres before a big journey to make sure everything is working and in good condition. I haven’t really done solo tracks for quite a while. When I was working with Alex, he had so much material to give that I could hardly stop him [laughs]. When I got back into the studio alone, it was like looking in the mirror, I was the only source of material available. Checking the juice is like testing yourself: can you still do it? You have to prove it to yourself everyday, anew.</p>\n<p><strong>Would you say this was a particularly difficult album to make?</strong></p>\n<p>Before I started recording, it was difficult. Because I had to get so many things out of my system, such as the last seven years with the Orb. But the album was actually much easier to make than expected. As soon as I started, I felt a good drive to it, and I was finished in a month! So the juice is still fresh [laughs].</p>\n<p><strong>Who made the artwork?</strong></p>\n<p>Albert Oehlen — he used to be a fellow student of mine in the 70s, and went on to be on the fucking excellent new painters. When I look at his paintings, I often feel like he uses space and colour in the same way I use time and sound. He has a given space that he uses to fill up with colours, and I have a given time than I am filling up with sound. He has a great way of mixing high and low art, which is something I feel very connected to. It’s why I like using very kitsch-y sounds with very gritty sounds. Sometimes I look for drum sounds and I think ‘agh this doesn’t sound shit enough!’ Sometimes I want to find a really shit-sounding thing, and take it out of context to make sound it good again. This is the kind of ugliness where bad becomes good.</p>\n<p><strong>I also like your use of the word ‘techno’ as a verb: to techno, as a kind of process.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah because it totally is, man! That’s how it works for me. It’s obviously not limited to the bang-bang-boom club culture. Techno is a way for me to treat my machines and a way to draw out inspirational and fun music. If you really want, you can say ‘to techno’ is to make art! Techno is a form of art for me, and I am always stunned by how many different shades of the genre come out each year. What was expected to last only three years is now with us for nearly three decades. This week there is a big celebration of the techno’s longevity in Berlin. 1988 was the year this <a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/Various-Techno-The-New-Dance-Sound-Of-Detroit/release/65112\">Detroit techno compilation</a> came out on 10Records — that had a very big impact on me at the time.  We were certainly doing stuff during those days but it wasn’t what you would call ‘techno’. But that’s the thing — with music you can only ever try to fulfil the fantasy in your head with the stuff you have around you. When Juan [Atkins] started making music, he said he wanted to sound like Donna Summer. He failed, but how brilliant was that failure!</p>\n<p><em>'Los Lagos' is out now on <a href=\"https://kompakt.fm/releases/thomas_fehlmann_los_lagos\">Kompakt</a>.</em></p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=359330282/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=f171a2/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=3237116835/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://thomasfehlmann.bandcamp.com/album/los-lagos\">Los Lagos by Thomas Fehlmann</a></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>An intriguing new compilation has been announced, taking the natural resonances of custom-built stones to create music. The stones, which don't look dissimilar to the <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/arrival-production-designer-reveals-how-create-an-new-type-flying-saucer-945155\"><em>Arrival</em> spaceships</a>, are at once objects of primordiality and futurism. The idea of making music from stones is so pre-historic that it is almost unsettling. This is a depiction of music at its origins: centuries before instrument crafting, millennia before recorded sound. Yet the stones used on this album have been cut with laser precision within a hair's breadth margin, to optimise the acoustic resonances of the object. Consequently, the sounds are strangely exotic, bursting with a riveting modernity.</p>\n<p>This sense of modernity is bolstered by the artists featured on the record, all of whom operate at the cutting edge of contemporary music. The album comes bundled with a sound stone sample pack containing audio samples of the Halliday/Fessmann sound stone, as used on this album by the other artists. The album consists of nine experimental interpretations by a star-studded line up, featuring Jasmine Guffond, Paul Jebanasam, Afonso Ferreira, Tomonari Nozaki, James Leyland Kirby, Steven M Halliday, Monty Adkins, Yves De Mey and Rutger Zuydervelt.</p>\n<p><em>Sound and Stone</em> forms the final phase of Steven M Halliday's two-year research project into the Fessmann sound stones at the University of Huddersfield.

    "content": "<p><em>Wang Fujui &amp; Lu Yi.</em></p>\n<p>I'm told by musicians working in Taiwan's capital, Taipei, that the experimental music scene there is small enough that you could know pretty much everyone involved in just a few days. Lucia H Chung, curator of Music Hackspace's Taiwanese residency, told me that she didn't even know there was an experimental scene until she left the city, so covert are its operations. Yet the artists that have come from the city present a diverse range of burgeoning styles. From the chaotic city-scape grooves of Meuko! Meuko! to the sonic spiritualism of Sheryl Cheung, Taiwan today is a microcosm of innovation. To conclude our focus on Taiwanese experimental music this summer, we've listed 5 of our favourite experimental artists from the country that are working today.</p>\n<p>###Meuko! Meuko!</p>\n<p>Relatively new to the scene, Meuko! Meuko! has gained a considerable following through her <a href=\"https://www.nts.live/shows/meuko-meuko\">monthly radio show</a> on NTS, giving an hour of &quot;warped, percussive and pulsating selections&quot; from the producer. Meuko! Meuko!'s productions are markedly metropolitan, drawing from Taipei's bustling streets to reproduce the claustrophobia of city-living. Listen below, for example, to 'The Temple', the lead single from her <em>Ghost Island EP</em> released earlier this year on Danse Noire. Over what sounds like homemade field recordings of the city streets, Meuko! Meuko! chants sinister words to bring the darkness of the urban sprawl into light.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/456845835&color=%2300aabb&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<br>\n###Wang Fujui & Lu Yi\n<p>Wang Fujui is something of a constellation point for Taiwanese experimental music. You cannot study the history of the genre without seeing his name pop up somewhere, such is his influence. This is in part down to his founding of <em>NOISE</em> in 1993, Taiwan’s first independent record label and zine to focus specifically on experimental sound. Since 1993, <em>NOISE</em> has become an indispensable entry-point for anyone wanting to learn more about the scene. Moreover, Wang is currently an assistant professor of the Taipei National University of the Arts, Department of New Media Arts,\nTNUA, so many new artists from Taiwan will have learnt sound techniques and theory through Wang's public courses. In 2011, Wang founded Soundwatch Studio with Lu Yi (or 'lucky'), a space in which Taiwanese and international artists collaborate through workshops, with a focus on DIY electronics and the visual component of sound. The pair have toured together and performed at events and festivals including an exhibition at Birckbeck entitled <em>Shoot the Pianist - The Noise Scene in Taipei 1990-95.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/219845908&color=%23505868&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<br>\n###Sheryl Cheung\n<p>Although harsh in tone, Sheryl Cheng's noise arguably takes a softer approach than many of her contemporaries. Her music focuses on the concept of life itself: the force of nature driving our innate persistence to live. In particular, Cheung is interested in our conception of the natural world in a world that seems increasingly <em>post</em>-natural. Her sources of inspiration are less sonic than they are cosmic: drawing on Taoist ideas of sound and energy, breathing and consciousness. Last year, Cheung produced to two projects: <em>Moon Tides</em> and <em>Future Tao</em>. <em>Moon Tides</em> explores the communion between human and plant life: to what extent do we share commonality in our experiences of pain, sexuality and growth? <em>Future Tao</em> is a reimagined soundscape for martial arts in the present day: how should we interpret ancient scriptures and apply them to our modern lives?</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/303453323&color=%23505868&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<br>\n###en creux\n<p>Head of the Happened events and radio series, as well as curator of the current Music Hackspace residency showcasing Taiwanese artists, Lucia H Chung (aka en creux) has been a driving force for platforming Taiwanese experimental music in London. But her solo work is arguably less well known, although no less impressive. I first became aware of her work through SM-LL, her co-managed label and a favourite spot of mine for hearing new neo-minimalist oddities. Her solo work takes the bread and butter of electronic music (the sound-wave, the process of repetition, the hardware) and brackets out the original context. Listen below to her contribution to the SM-LL <em>Default</em> series, a searing example of minimalism's potential for unsettling simplicity. Her <a href=\"http://www.straylandings.co.uk/reviews/batch-0002\">Reloc</a> project, with Martin J Thompson, is also well worth a listen.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/135929583&color=%2300aabb&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<br>\n###LTY\n<p>One of the central metaphors for noise music is that of freedom. Noise musicians often talk about wanting to break down barriers of sound and society through the power of free-improvisation. Indeed, early Japanoise artists like Merzbow even sought to free noise music from the shackles of guitar-based feedback. By introducing electronics to noise, musicians were freeing themselves of historical cliches and genre pigeon-holing. The question of freedom is of particular importance to a country like Taiwan. It's no coincidence that Fujui Wang's <em>NOISE</em> label started around the time that a popular movement for Taiwanese independence re-emerged. For many musicians in Taiwan in the 90s, noise was more than merely a musical device, it was an expression of autonomy. One of the best of the noise-y Taiwanese artists, LTY (aka Lai Tsung-Yun) weaves together field recordings into a bustling frenzy of harsh tones. Tsung-Yun is also the curator of Taiwan's <a href=\"http://lsf-taiwan.blogspot.com/\">Lacking Sound Festival</a>, one of the most prestigious events for experimental sound artists in Taiwan. Listen to 'METHOD 4-4' below, a deafening reminder of noise music's emancipatory force.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/494592750&color=%23505868&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><em>Catch Wang Fujui, Lu Yi, Meuko!Meuko!, Tzu Ni and LTY this weekend at Somerset House as the final show in the Music Hackspace residency.

Mentioned in the creation of his latest album, <em>Labyrinth</em>, are electric guitar, Dark Energy Doepfer, harmonic pipe, critter, Guitari Organelle, hurdy gurdy, pantophone, alto saxophone, duduk and flute, just to state a few.</p>\n<p>The Nahal Recordings released LP finds its origins in an audiovisual installation Oberland constructed for the Labanque Gallery in Béthune, France. A photograph of his inspired by the Greek myth of the Minotaur, 'The Tears of Minos', was displayed in the centre of the gallery, with a 90 minute composition for eight speakers playing on a continuous loop. The LP arrives in a condensed form of this — warbling resonances, haunting dulcet tones and fireside crackles come together in a homage to texts such as Dante Alighieri's <em>Inferno</em>,  and George Bataille's philosophical treatise, <em>Inner Experience</em>.</p>\n<p>With the release due for the 26th October, we were kindly offered an exclusive stream of 'La Part Du Feu', an achingly sparse piece of meandering electronics.

This is something of an exclusive for Stray Landings in so far as the project really is brand new. The duo played their first show only last month.

    "content": "<p>It might seem rather generous to refer to a four track release as an album. <em>Care</em> however, the latest outing on Peter Rehberg's Editions Mego, is an unlikely exodus for its succinct tracklisting. The release is authored by Swedish producer Klara Lewis and actor-come-musician Simon Fisher Turner — two acts who have both contributed to the Vienna-based label previously.</p>\n<p>Lewis has displayed a mastery of sonic manipulation in her previous releases, creating enchanting electro-acoustic collages which push their source materials to the extreme. Fisher Turner's work on the other hand is closer to the world of traditional composition, relying more heavily on acoustic instruments and conventional writing techniques for his evocative neoclassical constructions. Their album together is a patchwork of different cultural and sonic signifiers, an approach not dissimilar to that taken by the likes of Jon Hassell or David Toop in it's untamed, free-roaming nature.</p>\n<p>On this score, '8' is perhaps the most disconcerting. Sickly sweet sample stretches and forest ambience are punctured abruptly by fragmented blasts of warped percussion and gauzy vocal manipulations. There is something reminiscent of Vladislav Delay's <em>Visa</em> project in the track, with its ruptured bursts of noise, data-moshed ambience and bit-crunched percussion - a jarring blend of turmoil and tranquility. 'Drone' on the other hand takes an entirely different tact. Plaintive piano, gentles waves of static and meditative drones take on a cinematic mood, a comforting antidote to the disconcerting chaos which precedes it. Then there is 'Tank', a glistening, ethereal exploration through spacegaze ambient, faded eastern tonalities and wild explosions of glitch.</p>\n<p><em>Care</em> is an ambitious project considering the range of different styles it encapsulates, but one obviously handled with much care and respect for its sample sources. The piece holds together like a dream sequence, making perfect sense while you are in its midst, but otherwise difficult to quantify or articulate. What is certain is that Lewis and Fisher Turner make an undeniably complementary pairing, and one with plenty of scope for future innovations.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/482712009&color=%23ee3560&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Martin Delaney.</em></p>\n<p>Renick Bell is a US-born computer musician, researcher and teacher. Before getting interested in electronic music through drum n bass in the 90s, he was was playing guitar in screamo bands and this influence can be heard in the turbulence of his releases. The abstract and dense compositions of his have been released on the forward-thinking label UIQ owned by Lee Gamble. This August also saw a release of Bell’s first solo LP on Seagrave, a label featuring some of the most exciting current names in the scene such as rkss and Graham Dunning.</p>\n<p>Today, Bell lives in Japan where, inspired by the scene in the UK, he organised the country’s first algoraves - events with live coded music and projections of the performers’ screens. They form part of a larger social movement that aims to reclaim algorithms amid the increasing penetration of the various software in our lives. Arguably, coding skills are now as important as writing or speaking and algorave attempts to stimulate people’s curiosity in developing them.</p>\n<p>Keen on encouraging people to explore these new possibilities, Bell has dedicated five years of his life to developing his own software. The resulting live coding library <em>Conductive</em> is based on the programming language Haskell and draws on a large collection of samples to create compositions in real time. It’s available online for free, allowing anyone to use it and aiming to overcome restrictions of the mainstream use of algorithms by large corporations. Ahead of his performance at Unsound Festival this month, I met up with Bell over traditional curry in Shoreditch to discuss the present and the future of his craft.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/321094838&color=%23b49890&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>You relocated from the US almost 20 years ago, first living in Taiwan and now Japan. How do you think moving abroad has affected your creative process?</strong></p>\n<p>I went from working 60 hrs a week in New York to working 20-25 hrs a week in Taiwan, so I had a lot more time for music. That’s when I first really started to think about making my own software. I was just using the DAW to make music, but it was really tedious. I mean, here’s a snare drum, you put it here, okay I’m gonna copy it, I’ll put it here. I’m going to do this over 5 minutes, I copy them all, but I want to vary the pattern and I need a different snare drum sound. You are putting sounds in time exactly where you want them, but it’s like laying brick, and you can’t make music live that way: it's constructing music, it’s not performing music, and I wanted to perform. I had much more time in Taiwan to make music than in New York. I hadn’t thought about building my own software because I didn’t have time, but then I had time in Taiwan so I thought: “I’m gonna try make my own software so I can perform this kind of music live”. I guess also I was living in the mountains outside of Taipei, in a rainforest, and I had much more time alone, so there was a certain amount of isolation. I was less social at the time, so I had more time to be in my own world to think about what I was trying to do.</p>\n<p><strong>Taiwanese experimental music scene seems to be booming now, are you familiar with it?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah - Meuko! Meuko! is a good friend. We’ve been making some music together, and I have a track with her. It will be on an album that I hope will be finished this year, but we did this track so long ago. She’s been super patient about waiting for the track to come out. There was always a little bit of underground music in Taiwan, and the Smoke Machine crew started doing this kind of minimal dub techno podcast and event, but the scene has developed a lot recently. The noise scene just really took off after I left, which is kind of bad timing [laughs].</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1947/43415317620_a71f69e869_h.jpg\" alt=\"v\"></p>\n<p><strong>Do you go out?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah! I go out as often as I can. Sometimes with work it’s hard, and often I’m teaching at night, so that especially hurts my ability to see evening shows. The concerts wind up being difficult to attend, particularly things like experimental stuff. I’ve missed a lot of good shows because of that, which is annoying, but I go to club events fairly often.</p>\n<p><strong>‘Live-coding’ has always struck me as a great way to re-introduce a visual component to laptop sets. To what extent do you think live-coding is an aesthetic choice, as well as a practical one?</strong></p>\n<p>For me, it was initially a completely practical choice. The first software I made for my Masters in 2005/6 had a graphical interface, and you had to play it with a mouse. I always say, it was like playing a guitar with one finger. Everything came down to where that finger clicked, so it wasn’t so satisfying. But when I started coding, when I started controlling the music directly, I found it was much more powerful. I guess it was really a practical choice, but I can’t take complete credit for it. Alex McLean and the established live coding scene became very influential to me in a lot of ways. They have this slogan, “show us your screens”, I thought “it’s cool, why not?”. I always want to see what performers are doing, and if you're on a laptop and you don’t project your screen then nobody knows what you are doing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;...More and more our lives are run by software, but if we don’t have the right to see inside and to modify it, then we’ve lost control, then we’re moving towards a totalitarian state...&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The classic joke goes: is he checking his email? Nobody knows, right? But if we project the screen, everybody knows what you are doing; they may not understand, but at least they can see. It’s interesting and you can learn something from it, but also a big part of this is openness. I think we can extend this value all across society - everything needs to be open, like Facebook’s algorithms [for example]. Why do I see these stories first? Why don’t I see my best friend’s posts ever? What’s the reason for that? Facebook doesn’t show us. There’s so much secrecy about what happens in government, then things become open and we become shocked, asking why things turned out this way. There is a very important ethical reason for showing our screens. We want to promote this value of openness.</p>\n<p><strong>McLean also suggested that live coding is about being present in the moment and responding to the environment as it happens. What do you think? Could this concept be expanded across all society as well?</strong></p>\n<p>Hmm I never thought about it before. I guess, why not? Improvisation is useful. That’s a good skill to have. What I hope people are taking from the performances is that they, especially someone who doesn’t have experience of coding, will see a live coding performance and then will have the desire to develop skills in coding. I hope people try to understand algorithms and know how these things are affecting their lives. That’s what I really hope people are getting from it.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/480514725&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Tell me about your thought process when you are live-coding.</strong></p>\n<p>I’m always thinking in the future about what it is that I want to accomplish. I’m always thinking 30 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes into the future. When I’m writing something, the audience can see me typing and that my interaction is... super busy. They see me banging away on the keyboard, but it isn’t related to what they are hearing just now. What I’m doing at that moment is related to what they are going to hear in a few moments. And finally, I hit “enter” and then the sound changes. I’ve made all these decisions moments before, so I’m present in the moment but I also have this constant future focus.</p>\n<p><strong>Your library <em>Conductive</em> is available for free, as well as most of the live coding software. Do you think that is important?</strong></p>\n<p>Very important. ‘Free software’ people talk about “free-as-in-speech, not free-as-in-beer”. Of course, it’s free-as-in-beer, but the important thing is that it’s free-as-in-speech. Free-as-in-beer is a side effect. It happens not to cost money which is important, but what’s more important is the fact that you literally you have the right, to see inside and to modify it. That’s really important to me. More and more our lives are run by software, but if we don’t have the right to see inside and to modify it, then we’ve lost control, then we’re moving towards a totalitarian state. Especially since software is taking over everything.</p>\n<p>You need that ability to get inside of it and see how it functions, to know when it’s functioning not in your best interests and then to modify it. Not functioning in your best interest can be thought of as a bug, right? For example, my friend's posts just don’t show up in my Facebook feed. Why is that? He’s my good friend, and I want his posts to be there. Also I want posts to be in chronological order: if somebody posted about an event and Facebook shows me the post two days after the event, it’s useless, so I want it to be in chronological order. I mean, that’s my personal choice and I want to be able to make that adjustment. Facebook doesn’t allow me to because of their algorithms. Their software is closed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1958/44317492375_4bcc343061_h.jpg\" alt=\"vv\">\n<em>Photo by Alexandre Meunier.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Do you use social media often?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, all the time. I get really annoyed by people who talk about how that stuff is not real. I think it’s super real, it’s just that reality has shifted to another part of our lives. I don’t think that it’s virtual, it’s just life and our life has taken on this huge additional space, but it’s still life. The fact that it’s digital doesn’t make it any less real than walking down the street. That’s my opinion about it. Maybe it’s a radical opinion. I’ve been online forever and for me things have just gotten more fluid but it’s just another way to interact with people. The fact that someone is removed at a distance of thousands of kilometres makes no difference for me.</p>\n<p>The online community is super important. It helps to build an audience and see which people  are using your software. They can communicate online and become friends, and then it’s an audience for having events, especially to play in foreign countries. If these communities didn’t exist than I wouldn’t have had the initial opportunities to perform that I did have. It was critical for me in fact. The community that Alex has built here in London and in Sheffield has been so important to me. I started to play shows here around 2013, when I couldn’t get shows in Japan even. The idea of openness also extends to community and to trying to include other people. One of the really nice things about our scene is trying to include other people, trying to make sure that women feel included and not excluded, that they feel free to participate, that they feel encouraged to participate. This is important.</p>\n<p><strong>What software do you use on your computer?</strong></p>\n<p>Linux. I started using it in 1999 and I have used only Linux since 2005. That’s when I gave up using Windows entirely. Linux is a modular system: you can assemble the whole environment from pieces that you like. In Windows, there’s a piece of software that determines what your windows will look like and how it functions. Windows gives you one choice, and Mac gives you one choice, but in Linux you have 30, 60, 100 choices and you can get the components that you like. I choose quite specifically the components that I like and build it so that it functions not exactly but pretty closely to the way that I want it to function. If you used my computer, you would be at a loss. You wouldn’t know how to do it because it’s basically a black screen. You’d have to know the keyboard shortcuts to get things happening. There’s no start menu; there’s no taskbar. But it’s like a sports car: on some sports cars the ride is very bumpy because of the suspension, so while it’s very good for handling and the driver can be in control and can sense the street much better, but in some ways for some people, it’s less comfortable to ride in. My computer is kind of arranged like this.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;...If we are really serious about treating the environment in a different way, then doing something symbolic like saying that we don’t need irrational consumption is good...&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>I heard you started using analogue gear in your sets? Why?</strong></p>\n<p>A few reasons. I wanted to collaborate with some musicians who are using modular synths, so I thought if I can control a modular synth with my computer then it will be easy for me to do a very intimate improvisation with them, by connecting our systems. If you have a modular synth and I have a modular synth, all you have to do is connect them by cables and it becomes one synth. I wanted to do this kind of improvisation. Another reason I did that is that I’m not so good at synthesis. I think synthesis is hard. I couldn’t get satisfactory synthesis on my computer. I couldn’t make it complex enough and have enough different voices happening simultaneously in a live situation. So I thought if I moved some processing of off my computer onto a modular synth, maybe I’d get closer to the kind of sound that I was trying to achieve. So that’s why I started doing it. Turns out that it hasn’t been as easy as I thought. It’s also difficult, and it’s kind of expensive. In fact, I’m sort of rethinking how I’m doing this.</p>\n<p>There have been some benefits. I have been able to do a few jam sessions with my modular friends, which has been fun. And I got some unexpected benefits: I found that I can get  continuous control in real time, and I also found that one of the nice things about modular synthesis is that the interface has been thought out and is very direct. If I move this knob in real time, the sound is changing in real time, whereas in live coding sometimes there’s a different relationship with time. I like that and I think it’s one of the strengths of live coding, this different relationship with time, but sometimes it’s still nice to be able to adjust something directly in time. So there have been some benefits, but it hasn’t been quite as good as I thought, plus it’s just heavy and hard to transport. It’s a bit of a hassle. I have had a lot of trouble with aeroplanes and stuff. I’m not gonna ditch it at least for the next 12 months or something. I’m gonna keep playing with it and see if I can get closer to what I want, but I realise that I’m not gonna get quite as far as I thought I might in the beginning, especially for live performances. Maybe in the studio it can be useful, but I think I overestimated how useful it’s gonna be in a live setting, so I gotta rethink that.</p>\n<p><strong>What are you working on at the moment?</strong></p>\n<p>A lot of things. For recorded material, I’ve been working on an album for Quantum Natives for a long time. One of the tracks is with Meuko! Meuko!, which we talked about earlier, and there will also be a track with Fis. There are tracks with of a lot of my collaborators, so it’s a full album. I’ve also got an album with another collaborator, Steph Horak, which is a whole album of studio improvisations and that is coming out on Conditional, Calum Gunn’s label. I’m not sure, but hopefully it will be out this year, and now we are working on the artwork for that. There are a bunch of other releases that are at various stages of completion. How many of them will get out this year I’m not sure, but there’s a bunch. And I’m preparing another solo album. I just had this one on Seagrave, but hopefully early next year, springtime, I’ll have another solo album. So there’s a lot of recorded material coming.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1934/45178039522_def242a442_h.jpg\" alt=\"hh\"></p>\n<p><strong>How are you going to release it? Which formats?</strong></p>\n<p>I’ve been quite negative about physical releases for a while. I don’t think there’s a need for vinyl or tapes really anymore. I would like everybody to stop actually. I think if we piled all the vinyl in the world in a parking lot, there wouldn’t be that much of it. I mean it’s a lot, but in the grand scale of the world, it’s not that much plastic. But I think as a symbol it’s important because a lot of us are concerned about the environment. We want to see people treat the environment in a better way, and I think that vinyl and tapes are sort of unnecessary. If we are really serious about treating the environment in a different way, then doing something symbolic like saying that we don’t need irrational consumption is good, I think.</p>\n<p>Our cell phones are also not so great for the environment, but I can see the immediate utility of the cell phone, whereas vinyl, you can’t put it in your pocket and listen to it while you’re on the train. It seems irrelevant. There are people who are really into it… it’s hard, because I have this philosophical position, but then I have people who want to release my music and some of them want to release it on vinyl. And I talk shit about vinyl online so I’m gonna look a little hypocritical if I release music and it comes on a 12”. I still don’t want to release music on vinyl so much. At the same time, I do understand when people say they really like the physical aspect of it, like looking at the album cover. It’s a difficult issue for me at the moment.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think about the sound quality in different formats?</strong></p>\n<p>I think if you really want good sound, invest in good speakers. That’s what really changes the sound. Really good speakers in a nice room and a digital file can sound much better than vinyl on bad speakers in a bad room. There’s no question. You are really going to notice the sound from the speakers in the room, more than from the vinyl, and in fact vinyl is degrading the sound. Some people like the quality of that degradation. Sometimes they have a certain nostalgia for that sound, but it is a degradation, especially when the music is produced digitally. When you go from digital to vinyl, you are definitely losing things. So you might like the quality of that, but if you want to hear music as it was composed, vinyl is not the way I think.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/468793371&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Since beginning the label in 2013, founders Daniele Guerrini and Francesco Birsa Alessandri have taken Haunter Records in all manner of directions. There has been the roughneck four-to-the-floor techno of Cage Suburbia, the Radiophonic burblings of Somec, Zuli's distortion-laced jungle and Petit Singe's Eastern-influenced computer music.</p>\n<p>Their latest offering is no less idiosyncratic. Written by Berlin-based producer Linus Nicholson, aka Ausschuss, <em>Room1</em> is a decidedly sci-fi take on electroacoustic experimentation — a grainy exodus into wistful neoclassical compositions and data-moshed found-sounds. At times the EP calls to mind Mica Levi's <em>Under The Skin</em> soundtrack with its icy and foreboding soundscapes. Opener 'Drown Later' begins with caustic splashes of ambience, skittish percussion swaying to and fro lazily. Then there are tracks like 'Blinding Partner', a looming and sinister presence full of windswept drones and howling incantations.</p>\n<p>With the release due on November 2nd, the Milan-based label generously offered up an exclusive preview of title track 'Room1', a head-spinning mesh of granulated chimes, undulating low-end and gravelly atmospherics.

    "date": "2018-10-23T00:00:00.000Z",
    "content": "<p>One of the first times I met Maria w Horn, I noticed a sticker on her laptop from the UK anarchist group Class War, with the slogan ‘We Found New Homes for the Rich’ imposed on a picture of a graveyard. Curious, I asked whether Class War had formed a new sect in Sweden. Mats Erlandsson, also in the room, responded: ‘class war is everywhere’. Since then, Horn has produced a flurry of projects, including a cassette with Conditional (‘Excitation - Frustration - Excitation’), an audiovisual piece of synchronised sound and lights (‘Interlocked Cycles’), a string quartet piece inspired by black metal (‘Epistasis’), and a choreographed Tesla-coil performance at Norbergfestival (‘Alternating Currents’). It seems that as well as class war, Maria w Horn is also everywhere.</p>\n<p>Her new album, <em>Kontrapoetik</em>, goes right back to her roots, featuring sound sources, texts and even pressed flowers from her home region of Ångermanland. The area is interesting for several reasons. It’s known in part for its strong labour movement, with a long history of strikes and socialist organising. But before that, it was also the site of Sweden's largest documented execution of women accused of witchcraft, in the form of burnings and decapitations. Since the 1970s, the area has seen a rapid de-population and disintegration of the welfare state. This turbulent history has formed a character profile of Ångermanland as a — <em>forgive me</em> — anger-man-land: a place of frustrated workers rights, misogynist killings and economic desolation.</p>\n<p>Sweden is at an interesting juncture in that, since the election last month, the incumbent red-green coalition were unable to form a Government, with the Social Democrats receiving their lowest vote share for over 100 years. This is in part due to the rise of the nationalist Sweden Democrats, a party with origins in white nationalism and Swedish fascism. Like the populist movements of Brexit and Trump, the Sweden Democrats cynically seek support from a disenfranchised white working class, appealing to a nostalgia for a world that is pre-migrant and pre-modern. Alongside a virulent anti-immigrant hatred, part of the Sweden Democrat’s popularity comes from their promise of a return to ‘traditional Swedish culture’: the craft, music, and dance of a bygone folk era; the bread &amp; butter of the Swedish <em>volksgeist</em> as it was constructed in the latter part of the 19th century.</p>\n<p>Like Trump and Brexit, the Sweden Democrats have also weaponised a rural-urban dichotomy. In 2016, Trump and Farage successfully built a suspicion of elites in the metropolis. Whether in the Washington, Westminster or Brussels, metropolitans were cast as the fat bourgeoisie, the white-collar intellectuals out-of-touch with the rural proletariat. This is not a new formulation. The notion of civilisation is coterminous with the rise of urban life. The words ‘city’ and ‘civilisation’ share <em>civitas</em> as a common etymological root. If modernity can be marked by one thing alone, it would be our migration from agriculture to industry; from the horizontal plains of landscape to the vertical summits of the skyscraper. Even our speculative understanding of the future views the city as the locus of change. Baudelaire wrote of living in an “Ant swarming City/City full of dreams/Where in broad day the spectre tugs your sleeve”, and in the young art of cinema, Fritz Lang imagined our future destined for a dystopic <em>Metropolis</em>. The arrow of history seems to point in one direction only. And the Sweden Democrats hope to build support by collectivising populations at its tail-end.</p>\n<p>This makes <em>Kontrapoetik</em> a timely piece of music. The name itself implies a counter-reading of traditional narratives. Alongside research of the region, Horn worked as part of a satanic feminist sect, developing ceremonies and rituals based on counter-readings of the book of Genesis to unpick its misogynist tropes. In these counter-myths, Horn performs a kind of hermeneutics from hell, recasting Lucifer as a feminist liberator of womankind and an ally in the struggle against a patriarchal trinity: God, the father, and the male priesthood. Several of the pieces on <em>Kontrapoetik</em> were composed specifically for these ceremonial practices, as in the case of ‘Ave’. Moreover, the sound sources themselves are re-read into the work, drawing on organ-like textures reminiscent of music common to religious services. Here, the ceremonial music is re-appropriated for modern ends. The traditional croons of the pipe organ are sampled and re-synthesised for a piece that has more in common with satanic metal than it does with Sunday School.</p>\n<p>Finally, Horn’s side project, TMRW, counter-reads her own background in Ångermanland. The TMRW project examines the metaphor of car-culture and motors from different perspectives. Anyone who knows Horn personally will have picked up on her passion in that most Swedish of motors: the Volvo. She has even started an events series called ‘Motorave’, an analogue to ‘Algorave’ which puts the old technology of car stereos in place of the modern computer. But perceptions of cars also have a class divide. In the country, the car is an emblem of progress, a literal vehicle for social and geographical mobility. But in the cities, ‘car culture’ means ‘low culture’: the instant gratification of speed, smoke, and the smell of burning rubber. These paradoxical viewpoints — of the car as both the technology of ‘TMRW’ and yesterday’s news — is perhaps best put in the sleeve-notes for her <a href=\"https://tmrwtmrw.bandcamp.com/\">Ångerland EP</a>, in which she writes, <em>“…we cruise through towns made of burned out shops, broken down gas stations and gaping empty store windows. We used to believe in the future. Now we believe in the past...”</em></p>\n<p>This week we caught up with Maria w Horn to talk about the Swedish election, satanic feminism, and motoraves.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4tLYvyKQoB4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>So right now you’re in Ångermanland, which I believe is your hometown and features heavily in your new album. Why did you decide to focus on this place?</strong></p>\n<p>Due to a commission from a local museum in my home region Ångermanland I got access to the museum archives, and as I researched the history of this area it gradually started seeping into my work. One of the pieces on <em>Kontrapoetik</em>, 'Ångermanländska bilder', is based on Super-8 material depicting the environment during 1930-1940, the steamboats transporting timber along the river and sawmills before and after being closed down. The research I made in connection to this commission enabled me to politicise and see my own experiences of this area in another light to the point of being almost painfully introspective. Therefore the process of assembling <em>Kontrapoetik</em> turned into a kind of counter-exorcism, a way of exposing the traumas of the past in order to move on.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the political make-up like up there?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, historically and currently the real strongholds of the right-wing and national socialist movements have always been in the south of Sweden. The north on the other hand has a strong political history based on socialist ideals. That being said, it is true that the Swedish Democrats have grown more popular in the northern part of the country during the last couple of years. There is this overall phenomena of women leaving due to better prospects in the big cities, while men — particularly working class men — get stuck without the intellectual tools to properly analyse their situation, resulting in a growing misguided general frustration.</p>\n<p>The idea of people in the countryside as backwards and racist has gained a kind of renaissance, connected to the Swedish Democrats rising votes outside the big cities. It's a sad state of affairs, if people were to care about wealth distribution they would recognise that the cause of their despair are not the immigration streams but the economic system itself. Every time I return to Ångermanland, another store or hospital had to close down due to this eternal cycle of drawbacks in social services and a lack of people to keep the economy alive.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us a little bit about how this place fits in with your new record, <em>Kontrapoetik</em>.</strong></p>\n<p>While researching the commision piece I mentioned previously I spent a lot of time looking through photos, videos, and objects. All of this stuff was basically donated to Härnösands Museum by two siblings who were the owners of one of the saw mills. The siblings were wealthy and travelled the world, gathering art. The curators at the museum only recently started looking through the collection and found Matisse paintings and stuff [laughs].</p>\n<p>Going through that collection made me focus on our construction of history, which stories are told and what heritage is passed on. In this case for instance, I could not find any information about the workers in the industries that was the actual source of the wealth of these siblings. This in turn led me to focus my further research on the erased stories of Ångermanland.</p>\n<p>A fairly recent example would be the rebranding of the area of Ådalen. Events in the early part of the 20th century has led that name to be linked with the workers uprising. In the aftermath of the deindustrialisation of the region, the municipality, trying to attract tourists, has given the area a more mundane name: Höga Kusten ( the high coast). Another example is the toxic waste that rained down over Ångermanland after the Chernobyl Nuclear accident, making it dangerous to ingest fish and berries due to a high level of toxins. Due to this there is a high rate of cancer in the area, but this is never officially talked about.</p>\n<p><strong>It was also the site of a lot of witch burnings right?</strong></p>\n<p>Just a few days ago I visited ‘The Witches Mountain’,  the site where women accused of witchcraft by the church were executed in 1674. A huge monolith sits on top of the mountain with an inscription which reads ‘the faith of time befalls men’. This was one of largest documented executions in Sweden, and Christian moralism is still a strong undercurrent in Swedish society. There is a certain mentality that strikes me each time I get back here. The villages around here are small enough for people to know each other and be really involved in each other’s lives and be judgemental to the decisions of others, leading to a certain kind of conformity.</p>\n<p>Do you remember that after the black metal-related church burnings in Bergen in the early nineties there was a heightened sense of paranoia about teenagers becoming satanists? I was a goth kid at that time and I got thrown out of church - the priest called my family and said, ‘she’s a satanist!’ [laughs]. But I still can sense these latent expectations of fulfilling a predestined path, getting a normal job, buying a house, forming a family and so on. At the same time, I think that this mentality of always being involved in each others business plays a role in the historic strength of the area, and may prove an explanation as to why the labor movement grew particularly strong here.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1938/44590566775_b124e2afd6_h.jpg\" alt=\"xx\"></p>\n<p><strong>I seem to remember you talking about doing ‘satanic feminist rituals’ with Sara Fors when we first met.</strong></p>\n<p>During the period when I was making <em>Kontrapoetik</em>, I was oscillating between two projects: the local history of Ångemanland and Satanic Feminism in Stockholm. So these processes were really informing each other. I think it all started when I found this book, a doctoral thesis by Per Faxneld called ‘Satanic Feminism’, and I started making music based counter-readings of the genesis narratives that I translated to Latin for a choir piece that never got performed [laughs].</p>\n<p>I started researching the subject in more depth with Sara Fors and we applied for some funding to start a satanic feminist sect. The aim from the beginning was to gather material for a future performance but gradually it turned more and more into a closed practice. The goal was to work practically with sectarianism and separatism and see which artistic practices could develop in that context.</p>\n<p><strong>So what were you doing as a ‘sect’?</strong></p>\n<p>Rituals and ceremonies. But I don’t want to talk too much about that because the nature of a sect is that it is secret. Generally speaking, manifesting anger in different ways was a major theme. Counter-readings as a means of seeing who benefits from certain moral foundations, and validating the anger of those who do not benefit from it.</p>\n<p><strong>How have people in Ångermanland responded to your work?</strong></p>\n<p>I can’t say that the satanic feminist and counter reading approach has been well received. A few people reacted with complete confusion and even anger towards me lifting the violent parts of Ångermanland's past, and most people stop listening as soon as they hear the words 'Satanic' or 'Lucifer'.\nI guess it's a generational divide, as well as a theoretical approach that is easier to grasp for people with academic backgrounds. I don’t have to mention names, but a person close to me in Ångermanland got very upset and claimed that I have destroyed my future and reputation in the area, that nobody will hire me ever, and that I have violated the parish at Högsjö church by connecting it with satanism [laughs].</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/508000950&color=%23b49890&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Tell us about some of the sound materials you were using for this record.</strong></p>\n<p>'Ångermanländska bilder' is based heavily on the super-8 material I found in the archive, and I wanted to create sounds that did not seem too alien in comparison to the analogue pictures. Therefore I used the EMS Buchla 200 and tape machines blended with field recordings as a means of reconstructing the environment through the filter of my imagination.</p>\n<p>Also, I found this woman who was taking a course with Pierre Schaeffer in Uppsala in the '60s and after that she started making field recordings in this area. After corresponding with her I also ended up including some of her recordings in one of the pieces. Overall <em>Kontrapoetik</em> has been informed by my interest in combining contradictory modes of expression, finding points where more controlled compositional methods such as minimalist and formalist approaches can be combined and balanced with indeterminate procedures such as feedback or chance operations.</p>\n<p><strong>The vinyl also comes with some pressed flowers right?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, last summer I was obsessed with picking flowers and drying them and laminating them [laughs]. I don’t know if you know about the Swedish midsummer rituals? During the longest night of the year, you are supposed to collect seven types of flowers and you sleep with them under your pillow. Then you’re supposed to dream about your future love. I was really into that ritual as a kid.</p>\n<p><strong>It also seems like a continuation of the Dufwa project with Mats Erlandsson, which incorporated a lot of the local environment too.</strong></p>\n<p>Well, I guess that is true to some extent — that project was the first one were I utilised field recordings extensively. I used to be really purist about my sound and I was always very keen to make synthesis from scratch. So this is a new approach for me.</p>\n<p><strong>You also have this spoken word part to the album on ‘Ave’, what is being said here?</strong></p>\n<p>Someone else asked me to translate it to English before and I couldn’t. But the text is one of the outcomes of the sect, it was written by Djuna Michelle Jangmyr. It is an invocation, a means to mould a gateway to our fellowship with Satan and the values ​​connected to them. She actually wrote her master’s thesis arguing for a trans-theoretical and -activist fellowship with Satan. It’s a beautiful text, called ‘To Make Chaos in a Cisnormative Cosmos’ and that was one of the texts that really informed us as a group.</p>\n<p><strong>Am I right in thinking some of the sounds are also sampled from Swedish pastoral music?</strong></p>\n<p>I found a record which is called ‘Ancient Pastoral Music for Pipes and Horns’ and it has these very simple folk melodies. The stuff you hear on the album is layered and heavily processed through tape machines, so I’m not sure that you would even be able to identify the source. I wanted to involve some older traditional material and trace a history through the music. It felt natural to include those components, but fracturing and processing them as a musical extension of the counter-reading theme.</p>\n<p><strong>How does this fit with your TMRW project?</strong></p>\n<p>TMRW is my for-fun project without any obligations. This far I have not really connected it with my own name in an attempt to keep it free from expectations, but at this point it’s getting top complicated to sustain a secret moniker, so I just decided to stop keeping it a secret. The TMRW project is even more connected to Ångermanland, but in a more personal, almost therapeutic way. I grew up in the countryside in a working class environment. My dad used to be a car mechanic before he moved on to work in the engine room of an oil tanker, so from him I inherited a special appreciation of motors. Instead of a christmas tree he used to bring in his Harley Davidson motorcycle to the living room and pimp it with glitter and christmas decorations.</p>\n<p>I grew up with the car as this a symbol of ultimate freedom. Being stuck in the countryside, the car is like your way out of humdrum life, it’s literally a vehicle to an exciting life in the city. When I moved to Stockholm to study composition, I realised I had to rebuild my whole repertoire of cultural references. Contemporary classical music is such a playground for people with upper-middle class backgrounds, and many of them grew up with a similar set of references. Somehow I got annoyed with the fact that all the references to motor culture, as well as the music that I listened to growing up — a lot of metal and rock — where considered 'trash culture' and did not fit into the world of the contemporary composer. This led to a kind of personality split: on the one hand, I thought of myself as Maria-the-composer, who is able to appreciate a good Brandenburg Variation once in a while and so on [laughs], and on the other hand the TMRW moniker who doesn't give a shit and recaptures the impact of trash culture in her music. It’s another counter-reading I guess, of my own background.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/356126441&color=%23b49890&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><em>'Kontrapoetik' is out now on <a href=\"https://portals-editions.bandcamp.com/album/maria-w-horn-kontrapoetik\">Portals Editions / XKatedral</a>.</em></p>\n",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Paul Kulon.</em></p>\n<p>The central part of Krakow is surrounded by a strip of woody park, where orange leaves crunch underneath the feet. The first edition of Unsound took place here in 2003, soon after the city was selected as one of the European Capitals of Culture — an honourable title given by EU that celebrated its contribution to the world’s heritage. The culture of Eastern Europe has become somewhat fashionable over the last couple of years. From Rubchinskiy to Bassiani, the so-called New East has been making waves in Western press, although many still find it's surprising that Unsound, an event often dubbed as the most important affair in the avant-garde calendar, is located in an inconspicuous city in the south of Poland.</p>\n<p>But the choice of such locations requires trust in the audience and is an ode to the festival’s contribution to culture far beyond the boundaries of music. Recognising the influence of Unsound, much of its funding comes from local councils and many of the pundits were from neighbouring areas. The organisers, Mat Schulz and Gosia Płysa, make a conscious effort to include Krakow’s residents, but its youth has already got a lot to offer. In fact, the events with the highest proportion of locals were the liveliest. At the opening party at the old warehouse at Kamienna 12, the crowd danced to the irregular rhythms of experimental musician Lautbild, though blinded by the pulse of white strobes. The venue's closing event was one of the most atmospheric I've ever been to, with dancers staying lit until the very last second of a spectacular set by London-based DEBONAIR.</p>\n<p>The biggest highlight of this year’s edition was a performance by Polish composer Resina of <em>Traces</em>, her most recent album, recorded in the Wola district of Warsaw: a site of both the Jewish ghetto and the uprising of Polish underground resistance during World War II. The low tonality of her nervous cello, heavily looped and processed, is harmoniously juxtaposed to angelic singing and light striking of bells. Inspired by sacred objects and memory, her performance with Hubert Zemler was loomed over by a God-like projection of a giant Grecian bust.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1921/44922069644_3ca210290f_b.jpg\" alt=\"xxx\">\n<em>Resina &amp; Hubert Zemler. Photo by Michal Ramus.</em></p>\n<p>The evening concert at the century-old theatre followed an eponymous talk held earlier that day. The panel discussion, <em>Traces</em>, touched on a period of forced migration of Poles of Jewish origin in 1968 and a complicated history of Poland in relation to anti-Semitism. Incorporated in the fibre of Krakow, Unsound illuminates its local history through site-specific events by responding to the particular acoustics and energy of the venues. Among the festival’s most memorable venues was the Temple Synagogue, an active place of worship in a Jewish quarter Kazimierz. One of the performances hosted was by Todd Barton and the Kesh Ansamble — a magnificent reading of poetry written in a fictional language and supported by the intricate combination of live instruments and a trio of voices.</p>\n<p>A number of acts at the festival also nodded towards Eastern European sound culture. We heard HDMIRROR sampling t.A.T.u's 'All The Things She Said' and a set of donk from DJ Bus Replacement Service. Averaging at about 150 BPM, the genre is predominantly associated with Northern England, but also has a Eastern European sub-genre known as 'hard bass'. The DJ sampled tunes with lyrics about getting smashed on 'water' and falling on one’s face, which made me laugh while trying to keep up with the fast beats.</p>\n<p>There was also the performance of <em>Wysiadywanie góry</em> by Remek Hanaj. Supported by an ensemble playing a unique range of instruments, including metal forceps and a tambourine-like drum that was also used as a wind instrument, two vocalists drew much of my attention. They were singing in a resonate 'white voice', a Slavic tradition sometimes also called 'open throat' which allows air to escape lungs freely without vibrating in the face and mouth. The technique can be described as controlled screaming, making the voice sound powerful and grounded like a drone. The penultimate day of the festival also saw Drew McDowall meditations on the psychoacoustics of drone. The soothing vibrations of <em>Time Machines</em>  were supported by visually pleasing amorphous lines and pixels of waves by Florence To. The hypnotic journey was revitalising, reminding me of the talk held earlier that week with Eris Drew, who touched on the topic of healing through music.</p>\n<p>In fact, that Saturday afternoon ended up being my favourite experience, culminating with anti-opera by Colin Self whose voice saw a few members of the audience shed a tear, while my skin was covered in goosebumps all the way through. The operetta dissolved any boundaries between the artist and audience, with an acoustic and physical ownership of the space, moving through the rows of seats at the end of the performance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1977/44922069694_0e99f8eeb4_b.jpg\" alt=\"x\">\n<em>Photo by Dominika Filipowicz.</em></p>\n<p>A big draw for the festival is a lack of the traditional hierarchies and subordinations. Freedom, equality and participation are celebrated, most notably in the multimedia work Magna Surgat that premiered at the festival. The cutting-edge visual artist Sam Rolfes presented a semi improvisational 3D piece using body sensors to transform his movements from analogue reality into the game-like world. He was supported by a musician Rabit and multidisciplinary collective House of Kenzo. The performance of the latter began almost amateurly which only made their provocative and outrageous dance moves more impactful as the show went on. At its climax, my jaw literally dropped, and my notes consisted of a lot of exclamation points and swear words. In fact, it was the only performance I felt the need to record: so intense was the experience I had to re-watch it to piece together what had happened.</p>\n<p>It seems out of place to consider some performances at Unsound without considering all of the elements of the programme. It’s a festival of contradictions (a drum solo by Adam Gołebiewski was snuck right into the middle of a club night, for instance), but the biggest one is that it’s still being boxed into a primary category of music. The design of this year’s theme posters was an artwork in itself, imagining the possible future of humanity in a symbiosis with technology, dystopian and hopeful. With a flair for noticing the next big thing, Unsound is a measure of tectonic changes in society.</p>\n<p>Since its first edition in 2003, the festival has grown a lot: from a small basement with just over 100 people to hosting a couple thousands in multiple locations. Nevertheless, it kept a feel of community. Mat and Gosia were seen at most of the events, even at 2am at Szpitalna 1, ensuring me that it’s still a project that is genuinely cared for. While some artists were clearly invited to lure people in, it was done with an aim of introducing new things to the audiences that may not have been exposed to them otherwise. Unsound is a place to go to be blown away, but it’s best to keep an open mind because you never know where you’ll find your new favourite artist.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>The first time I saw recsund perform live was in a strange kitchen-tiled venue, obscurely placed on the 4th floor of a building outside Kottbusser Tor, Berlin. His sound is hard to describe. With a flurry of sound effects, sampled beats, synthesis and even rapping, listening to recsund can feel like being sucked into a vacuum along with all the other detritus of popular culture. You can hear corporate idents and BBC news recordings alongside acid bleeps and breakbeats. But any semblance of recognition is soon replaced by a new torrent of information, each wave sublimating the next in a continual tide of data.</p>\n<p>recsund is also perhaps best known for one of the more successful marriages of sound and vision. The visual identity of the project is arguably tantamount to the music, immersing the audience in the 3D worlds of game design. For his latest A/V project, Tuner, recently debuted at Somerset House, he even performs live club visuals through a computer game engine. “I do have a lot of faith for the tricky medium”, he explains. “It's actually the absurdity of it that intrigues me”.</p>\n<p>But despite its similarity to the dizzying sensationalism of mass-media, the recsund project stays with you for much longer than any flashy advertisement could. From the meticulous post-production processing to his two-faced alien avatar (ProDance®), the recsund project is one that dodges straight-forward story-telling or empty signifiers. “2018 has become a time of progression”, he continues. “And of being harder on the grander ideals and desires of the recsund project”.</p>\n<p>What exactly those ideals and desires are must be first gleaned from the project itself. Following his most recent performance at the Quantum Natives showcase with Edited Arts, we asked recsund to give us a taste of his live performance as a contribution to our mix series.

    "date": "2018-11-19T00:00:00.000Z",
    "content": "<p>Our ‘In Focus’ series looks at the role of record labels today. Although a lot of music journalism explores the creative process of individual artists, little time is actually spent on the structural mechanisms by which artists release their material. In this edition, we spoke to TT (formerly known as Tobago Tracks). The TT roster is somewhat hard to summarise due to its internal variance. You can hear everything from grime to ambient here, yet the TT watermark is always audible. Part of this variance is down to the structure of the imprint itself. Formed by DJ Pitch in 2013, it is now run by two heads instead of one, with Gribs joining the imprint last year.</p>\n<p>DJ Pitch and Gribs have very different backgrounds. “Dance was the thing I believed I was going to do forever until I was about 20”, Gribs begins, “...so my main knowledge of art, theory, history and training came from that field. I read this book by George Balanchine that basically said a strong knowledge of music is a requirement to become a great dancer and I took it to heart. When I was going to dance classes, they would play the weirdest shit. Sometimes it would just be someone reading a poem, people breathing into microphones and so on. Other times you get a pianist playing these really corny versions of classic songs like…”, Pitch intercepts, “…My Heart Will Go On?” Gribs confirms: “Literally”.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=197896937/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=2465515904/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://tobagotracks.bandcamp.com/album/death-is-peaceful-life-is-harder\">Death Is Peaceful, Life Is Harder by Litter Frog</a></iframe>\n<p>DJ Pitch’s background, by contrast, is “the complete opposite”. “I trained classically and studied the first year of a classical music degree as a pianist”, he explains. “But I found studying music killed all of my passion for it, bizarrely enough. I spent all my childhood playing in bands, playing jazz, and singing in choirs. Back then I thought all electronic music was just corny, something you took drugs to and nothing else. When I was about 19, I started going to warehouse parties and it helped me understand why electronic music was popular. When I was playing in bands, I hated writing songs, especially the lyrics, but I realised you can express yourself through processes like synthesis. That was a big wake up call for me.”</p>\n<p>With these backgrounds in mind, the output of the label must satisfy the slim intersection of a musical Venn diagram. “We have an actual Venn diagram of our tastes somewhere in a notebook of mine” Gribs explains, laughing. DJ Pitch clarifies, “the label has been doing ambient and experimental pieces from the start really, but it now represents both of our own tastes.”</p>\n<p>The issue with many labels is how to comb through these tastes. If the output was purely an expression of taste, the output would be theoretically infinite. How then, do you decide on the ‘TT Sound’? Gribs answers, “there’s loads of music that I listen to which I love but wouldn’t necessarily work as a TT release”. Pitch adds, “yeah you just kind of know. There’s a quality control to running a label too. I only want to put out the best of a person’s work. But I also want it to be artist-driven, to release music from artists that really believe in their vision. Like that Sylvere release we did — his work mostly draws from  UK Funky but he made something that fit TT perfectly.” For Gribs, this is a highlight, “that might be my favourite thing we’ve put out… at least 'The Promise' is the track I’ve listened to the most, even before I was involved with TT.”</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3776570359/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=1385401109/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://tobagotracks.bandcamp.com/album/sylvere-the-promise-e-p\">Sylvere - The Promise E.P by Sylvere</a></iframe>\n<p>Historically, the most legendary imprints are the ones that have forged a sound that is synonymous with the label. But this isn’t always possible for output that aims to be expansive. “I don’t even know if that is even feasible for us”, Pitch resumes. “If there is a sound, it’s so broad, it’s just ‘weird music from England...’” Gribs responds, “I’m okay with that definition to be honest, that appeals to me as a consumer and curator.”</p>\n<p>As part of this expansion, TT are also looking into incorporating film into their roster. As Gribs explains, “we’re working with a few artists at the moment who engage with film, it seems to be a regular crossover that we’re finding. I would love for that visual component to come through more in our club nights. For some reason it used to feel indulgent to be like ‘here’s a film on top of everything else’ but I don’t feel that way now”. Pitch adds, “I like it when you can look at an artist’s Instagram, and listen to their music and find the thread that weaves between the two. Sometimes a visual component gives you a setting or backdrop for the music. Most of the artists we work with don’t identify strictly as musicians — it’s broader than that.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4890/31020678387_bb10cd3021_h.jpg\" alt=\"x\"></p>\n<p>One of the questions surrounding labels today is how to compete with self-releases via Bandcamp, Soundcloud and the other online streaming platforms. Now, artists can release music themselves, without the need for label backing. In light of this, what is the function of a label today? Gribs replies, “you can’t be complacent with A&amp;R, because when it’s done well in can have such a big impact for the artist. I think you can tell when people are being complacent. If you have the privilege of having a platform, especially one that receives press and attention, radio time and opportunities to do events, you have to be willing to put time into researching artists and making careful considerations about who you want to work with and develop.”</p>\n<p>A label is also a space for an in-person community. As Pitch explains: “quite a lot of the artists I work with are people I know from years of putting on nights, producing and doing radio. Part of the joy of running a DIY label is being able to put things out super quick and still release a high quality product. But the majority of the music we find is initially through the web, like object blue.” The object blue release was something of a pivotal moment for the label, as Pitch clarifies: “it’s the thing I’ve been most asked about this year: did I expect it to be that big? I knew it would be really good, and really well received. In the months leading up to it, you could see that people were really interested in what she’s doing.” Gribs responds, “I like artists like Rena who also listen to a wide range of stuff. Her background in poetry and literature is fascinating, I like to see a path through different art forms, I guess because that’s similar to my background.”</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=198780006/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=f171a2/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=3473982047/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://tobagotracks.bandcamp.com/album/object-blue-do-you-plan-to-end-a-siege\">object blue - Do you plan to end a siege? by object blue</a></iframe>\n<p>Part of the issue with these self-releasing of online platforms is the placelessness of music. When artists are atomised into their respective artist pages, their sense of place and cohesion can be lost. As Pitch explains, “you have to stay engaged. If it’s all very planned and delivered digitally, then you run the risk of making the label placeless. The label puts our artists in alignment; not necessarily with each other but in alignment with an approach. We also give advice, we work with artists to help them get press, or a radio show, or to get booked for an event.”</p>\n<p>As Gribs continues, this is where the ‘point’ of a label comes in: “we work with nourishing artists and developing them, not just releasing their music, because anyone could do that. We get artists asking us about tech advice, booking advice, we proofread bios, CVs, applications… I think it’s important to consider how much of your artist’s overall goals you want to help facilitate. Consistently though, it’s about helping people get their music heard”. Pitch concludes, “somehow we’ve lucked our way into a situation where people listen to what we put out, so now it’s just a question of platforming artists we believe in and giving them all the opportunities we can.”</p>\n<p><em>The latest TT release from Litter Frog is available to stream now on <a href=\"https://tobagotracks.bandcamp.com\">their Bandcamp page</a>.</em></p>\n",

Now in its sixth year, the event includes everything from an 'ecological symposium' to a film night, club billing and performance by its own orchestra.</p>\n<p>You can also find the unorthodox in their choice of locations, with the bulk of the festival held at Ambika P3 – intensively a multi-purpose arts-bunker housed underneath the University of Westminster. There are also four 'satellite' venues this year, including the plant-filled Second Home Spitalfields, Hackney Wick warehouse venue Bloc and Walmer Yard in Notting Hill - a selection of townhouses designed by the architect Peter Salter forming a striking courtyard of concrete, mirrored windows and wood panelling.</p>\n<p>Running across the first two weeks in December, this year the LCMF have teamed up with collaborators such as the Manchester label The Death of Rave, experimental ensemble Apartment House and the Serpentine Galleries. The resulting lineup includes everyone from the likes of Klein, JASSS and experimental tape composer Annea Lockwood to Beatrice Dillon, Gábor Lázár and SND member Mark Fell.</p>\n<p>The LCMF are equally as interested in music from years gone by as they are the contemporary however. They carried off a hugely successful event a few years back presenting one of the first comprehensive Julius Eastman retrospectives every conducted, shining light on a composer overlooked for several decades. A homage to Eastman in the form of a performance of <em>The Prelude and Holy Presence of Joan d'Arc</em> also features this year. The event have also seen fit to revive other artistic works from years gone by, including Michael Snow's 1971 experimental film <em>La Région Centrale</em>, shot using a robotic arm pre-programmed to make specific movements.</p>\n<p>To find the full programme, visit <a href=\"https://lcmf.co.uk/\">LCMF</a>.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/340084482&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>The Swedish cassette label XKatedral have announced three new releases, featuring work from Zach Rowden, Mats Erlandsson and Daniel M Karlsson. The label, headed by Maria W Horn and Kali Malone, is known for a peculiarly modern brand of Gothic drone. Last year, they released a similar trilogy of cassettes which you can read more about <a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/news/xkatedral-announce-new-cassette-trilogy\">here</a>. Sonically, where many drone musicians shy away from traditional instrumentation, XKatedral have forged a unique identity by reclaiming these instruments for the present. You can hear a church organ through a distortion pedal, or a guitar time-stretched into infinity.</p>\n<p>These latest releases continue in this tradition. In Erlandsson's <em>4-track guitar music</em>, melodic motifs are overlaid one-another into a canonical structure, creating a continuous growth of tones. Once recorded, the music was re-amplified in the former machine hall of Ställbergs Gruva, a disbanded Swedish iron mine. In Zach Rowden's <em>TASKED</em>, the contrabass is given a brutal makeover through the use of intense feedback and harmonic resonating. Finally, Daniel M Karlsson's <em>A loss of self</em>, features a theoretically infinite cycle of sinewave drones in just intonation. In a move that betokens Karlsson's love for open source, he has also made the code for this music freely available via his website which can be downloaded, modified, and listened to using the open-source program SuperCollider <a href=\"danielmkarlsson.github.io\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Listen below to a premiere of ‘Fog Area’ from the Zach Rowden cassette. If you’re in Stockholm, there is also a launch party <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/177847963148036/\">this evening</a> at Fylkingen featuring performances by JH1.FS3, Mats Erlandsson, Sorrowing Christ, Händer Som Vårdar, Zach Rowden, Elena Wolay, and an exhibition by Free The Land.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/537719337&color=%231d1d1d&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Many have explored the crossover between leftfield techno and breakbeat, yet none quite like Shelley Parker. Tracks like 'Beachy Head', 'Catch' or 'Endgame' from the recent Towards Collapse compilation see breaks turned to raw, skeletal percussive weapons, bold in their stark, bare-bones approach.</p>\n<p>Her latest EP comes courtesy of London flagship label Hessle Audio — a name associated with ever-consistent quality over the 11 years it has been in operation. Hessle made their name providing an alternative take on the dubstep popular in the late '00s, and these days are giving much the same treatment to the assorted dancefloor styles popular at the moment.</p>\n<p>Given this, Parker makes a fitting selection for the label, as her work stretches far beyond the usual boundaries of dancefloor production. Over the past few years she has worked on scores for choreographers, composed for theatre productions and created sound installations following commissions from the likes of the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum and the De la Warr Pavilion in East Sussex.</p>\n<p>The title track makes a good mission statement for the release, flitting between crumpled half-step and barrelling percussive assaults. Creaking atmospherics and oddball chimes resonate in the backdrop, calling to mind the granular technoid experiments of Electric Indigo or Retina.it.</p>\n<p>At other points the EP feels fuzzy and slightly out of grasp, reminiscent of releases on the Chain Reaction imprint. 'Masonry Pier' sees sun-blushed washes of ambience underpinned by twitching found-sound rhythms and staggered kick drums, while 'Angel Oak' is a slow-motion exodus into ghostly dub textures and clattering, brittle rhythmic loops. The EP is also graced with a robust reimagining of the track by Sam Smith aka Ploy. The Bristolian producer puts the original under a heat lamp, reducing the vapourous textures to a tautened, swaggering percussive workout.</p>\n<p>Parker has turned in an EP which evokes the freehand, improvisational quality of her live sets while sidestepping easy-categorisation. Rhythmic loops are stretched out to a languid drawl, kicks clatter like ageing machinery and atmospheres burble and hiss like a steam train churning steadily towards its destination. It's pure factory music to put it simply — rough around the edges in an undeniably seductive manner.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/528623310&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Ahmed El Ghazoly, aka ZULI, meets me in a cafe during Unsound. His new album, and debut LP, <em>Terminal</em> was to be released in November on Lee Gamble’s label UIQ. Judging from his publicity photos, I imagined to be meeting someone serious, frowned, if not a little intimidating. But I couldn’t be more wrong about what he’s like. El Ghazoly struck me as a soft-spoken and courteous collocutor, who soon began asking questions in return and on my attempt to draw the attention back to him, noted that “we are only halfway through the salads”.</p>\n<p>In Cairo, he’s known as one of the leaders of the underground music scene. The club VENT he was running with the group of friends was responsible for bringing international DJs to the city, as well as introducing Egyptian DJs to the world. The cultural exchange is present in his music too: his set at Unsound was a mix of techno and jungle, while <em>Terminal</em> blends genres like breakbeat, hip hop, trap and ambient to a somewhat deconstructed effect. “Many of us who don't fit into any one specific group identity feel sidelined at best”, writes El Ghazoly in the album’s description. Growing up in the UK and now living in Egypt, he speaks up about the exoticism of Eastern music and culture, which pigeonholes people into the roles he doesn’t want to play.</p>\n<p>During our lunch in Krakow, we chatted about the importance of collaboration, new album and future plans, local scenes and putting music first.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/437414766&color=%230d0d0d&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>You say that sounds aren’t connected to the geographical locations anymore, but I can think of a few artists whose music can be described as having such local quality. What do you think?</strong></p>\n<p>That’s something you can consciously do. I don’t want to assume anything, but I feel like a lot of people consciously do that, especially where I’m from, in Egypt. You can tell that it’s not genuine. For instance, you see someone from rich areas making street music, but there’s no way you grew up like that, I mean, you can’t even pronounce Arabic properly, because you went to an international school. You can tell that in the vocals but Europeans, they don’t know, because they are listening to Arabic, it’s just Arabic.</p>\n<p>There is a lot of dishonesty. I know that for a fact, from the Egyptians I’m telling you about. I understand why they’d resort to that because it’s very attractive to promote us abroad, promote us more like a concept. It sells, I guess. There’s a movement in Egyptian music called Mahraganat, or Electro Chaabi as they call it sometimes, so that’s been massive since 2008/9 and it’s been steadily growing. The amount of musicians who’d switched to that just because it’s successful and because it’s easy… Nah.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you think the revolution of 2011 affected the music scene in Egypt? I’m speaking from personal experience, as in Ukraine the party scene has grown significantly after the turmoil of events.</strong></p>\n<p>Honestly, what we’re doing, in terms of the circles I operate in, it has very little to do with the revolution. I mean, of course it has — we were there at the time, so of course it has in some way or another — but it’s not political. I mean, everything is political, kind of, but it’s not specifically like “oh this is resistance music”.</p>\n<p>The only effect on music it had was mainly in instrument-based music, like rock bands and stuff. All of the sudden they were all singing about the revolution. Empty slogans, very generic stuff. If anything, the revolution was bad for the music scene. It did more harm than good, honestly. A lot of bands that had potential stopped developing. They just went… “alright, this is what sells, this is what makes you successful, let’s sing about the revolution”. How patriotic and revolutionary are you if you’re signed to Coke, and Pepsi, and Vodafone, and you do ads for like Range Rover. Come on. Don’t call yourself a revolutionary band.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the underground scene like then?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s a bit tricky because when you think about the funding and where it comes from… Obviously, it costs money to put on parties. Who’s gonna pay this money? Most of the time it’s British Council or other cultural institutions like that. Most of them can’t support things that have alcohol consumption and most of the cultural events, not just music, are funded by these bodies. They have a quote each year to spend on culture, I think. The corporations copy them saying, “we can fund you also and we allow alcohol” but they want to sell.</p>\n<p>So, it’s never really about the music: it’s about either what those institutions think music and art should be or what the corporations think will sell, what their type of audience would be. Then, you have a different class of Egyptians who can afford to spend money, but their taste is not… great. I mean, it’s like everywhere in the world. They don’t really like underground music, they are more into tech house music. So you have booming tech house scene in Cairo. It’s massive. They are doing really well.</p>\n<p><strong>I’ve read that some nights at VENT were quite expensive. How accessible were they to the majority of people?</strong></p>\n<p>On some nights we had to do that, yeah. We used to charge on the door on the club nights on Thursdays and we would book some of those tech house DJs. That’s the only night we’d make money. This allowed us to lose money throughout the week and book people who have no following. We debuted like 40 artists. So, we’d charge a lot on the door on Thursday, because these were like fancy people and then we’d lose it all. Most of the nights were free, but one other night was 50 [Egyptian] pounds, which is a third of what we would charge on the club night. It’s the only way we could survive.</p>\n<p><strong>Did the underground scene grow in size over the last couple of years?</strong></p>\n<p>For the dance part, yeah even the experimental dance part that we operate in. For the live performances, I don’t think so at all. Because there’s been no one putting on live nights really. There was this one series, but it was mainly the promoter’s friends and stuff. Attendance...what? 30 people, tops.</p>\n<p><strong>Your new album <em>Terminal</em> is less for dancing, but more for listening. Why did you decide to change focus?</strong></p>\n<p>That’s actually a bigger part of what I do and I feel like all the records I’ve put out don’t reflect that at all. At some point, I just felt like I have a lot of this material that I’d like to release, so I spoke to Lee about it… because I always go to Lee first anyway. I was like: “Listen, I’ve got an album I want to put out, I know you don’t do albums, I’m just telling you”. It was perfect timing, because they were actually thinking about releasing an album. So I used some of that stuff. At first, I wanted it to be specifically non dance, non hip hop, just like beatless, ambient stuff. But over time Lee convinced me to let got of the idea that it needs to be so rigid, and that was a good idea, because then I ended up blending these things in some of the tracks.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4805/46139974112_bf3d2a0e21_b.jpg\" alt=\"xx\"></p>\n<p><strong>The album features a lot of different vocalists and you were, and still are, a part of different collectives. Can you tell me about AHOMA, for instance?</strong></p>\n<p>AHOMA is dead. Unfortunately, it was very short-lived. AHOMA was supposed to be a collective of musicians, visual artists and promoters, so that we could all book each other, like a very contained scene. It was all about the money really: so the money would go around between all of us and the scene would kind of organically grow. The idea didn’t sit well with a lot of people who wanted to be like: “I’ve got an opportunity to play at this club, why can’t I play there?” And the idea was: while this club may never book this person from AHOMA collective, because they aren’t popular, they’ll book you, because you have a review somewhere and you’re good for them. But we wanted to support everyone, which is why a lot of people were like: “No, I don’t want that, I want what’s best for me”. It ended a couple of weeks before or after CTM, so February or March. And we started in December.</p>\n<p><strong>You seem to enjoy collaborating with other people. Why so?</strong></p>\n<p>I started out in a band environment. I always wanted to be in a band, but then I eventually let go of the idea of collaborating on the music itself. There’s a lot of really talented musicians in Cairo. I feel like they need to be heard. It’s not going to happen if each one of them works on their own. It’d be a shame not to help each other out and grow together. It’s a bit idealistic and it doesn’t work all the time, but at least we try.</p>\n<p><strong>In the description of <em>Terminal</em> you write that it “draws from an abstract narrative of increasingly frequent cycles of ego-death and rebirth”. What do you mean by that?</strong></p>\n<p>Literally that, on a very personal level. Life is all about learning, cycles. And the more you learn, the more you realise that you don’t know anything. When I look at the past, I can more or less see that it was a cycle and it’s done — I came out of it and that person died, that version of me died and I came out of it with this lesson. That’s the rebirth. And then you go to another cycle and then that person dies and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>What about working with visual art? You did an installation for CTM, is it something you want to continue doing?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, I’d love to do more of that. I’d love to do more installations in general, maybe not even specifically visual art. I’d love to move away from the dance floor and make less dance floor stuff. I mean, I do like dance music, but I also love experimenting with sounds. I feel like installations is a good way to do that, because you have a concept and it’s not entirely loose which I’m not a massive fan of, you know, music that’s entirely loose and aimless. Not a big fan of concepts either, but I think this is like a middle ground.</p>\n<p>In terms of the visual arts, I only shot the video for <em>The Magma</em> and someone else edited it — a really good video editor from Cairo, he works mainly in ads, it was his first time doing anything like that — but ideally I’d like to learn video editing myself. Not sure how I’m going to have the time to do that, but I definitely would like to work more with visuals like that and hopefully incorporate them into my live show at some point.</p>\n<p>I still like making dance music, but I feel like I’ve only done that so far, more or less, with the records that’ve been out. It’s more challenging and rewarding at this point to me to make music that isn’t made for the dance floor. I like melodies.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/515048433&color=%236c8c7c&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Have you had a chance to explore much of Unsound yet?</strong></p>\n<p>The Moor Mother thing was amazing. The drummer was like a machine, the control he had… and the bass player, they were so sync when put together. I really enjoyed that. I also went to the TCF’s discussion about swarm producing. That was really interesting, it’s a nice idea. I haven’t managed to see anything else, because I crashed as soon as I got here and then I woke up and went to Moor Mother and that’s it.</p>\n<p><strong>Ahead of the festival I spoke to Renick Bell, who has released on UIQ as well. I know you studied Computer Science, have you ever wanted to try live coding?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah. It’s definitely at the back of my head. It’s one of those things: if I have the time, I’m definitely going to learn how to do this. Seems really interesting.</p>\n<p><strong>Have you ever worked as a programmer?</strong></p>\n<p>No, not for a living. I was kind of good at it at the university. We used to write video games and stuff. We did a lot of AI. Then I graduated and I wanted to be a DJ. I’m still very interested in coding and dealing with machines in general. But when you’re at that age — I was in the university between the ages of 18 and 24 — you’re not entirely sure what you want to do with your life. I did try to get some jobs, but besides the coding all my grades in university were really low. I barely went. I was out partying most of the time. I was a promoter at the time also, so I graduated with a really low GPA, couldn’t get a job and was like: “Fuck this, I’m just going to continue DJing”.</p>\n<p><strong>So, you’ve never had like a formal job?</strong></p>\n<p>I did customer service for Vodafone for either three weeks or three months in 2008. It felt like three years. Hell. It was rotational shifts and I had set working hours. Some days I’d wake up at four in the morning, go to work, which is on the other side of town, finish work, come back and I had to sleep. It’s just… Nah. It’s not a life. Then, I did a lot of translation jobs, freelance, so I could also work on music at the same time. I did some IT work but I’d go into the office whenever they’d need me. I was also doing music at the time and I quit because I was in a band and we got SXSW. Music always had the priority.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think about the theme of this year’s Unsound? Presence not in a sense that we have to forget about the technology, but as a way to incorporate it in our lives sustainably?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s a perfect way to look at it. It’s better than a purist approach of letting go of technology completely. It’s a more realistic one. It’s very important to be present. I’ve struggled with that a lot. You know, when you spend most of your day looking at the screen, it’s very difficult. This mind-body connection thing is not a joke. So dealing with it responsibly is very good.</p>\n<p><strong>You have a show on NTS so you must visit London often or… No? Do you record it in Cairo?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, I’ve only been to London three times in my whole life. I used to live there as a kid, but in the past ten years, I’ve been there three or four times, yeah. I’m going there next week.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s your impression of it?</strong></p>\n<p>The scene is great, the music is insane, the options… quite a contrast with Cairo. The problem in London is “what am I going to sacrifice tonight?” That’s such a contrast with Cairo, it’s insane.</p>\n<p>I have this soft spot obviously, because I was there as a child, so I have this thing that I can’t really verbalise, the smell and everything. There’s something about London that I like, but when I think about it rationally: it’s so expensive and there’s ads everywhere, it’s like capitalism on steroids. So, that part I’m not in love with. Piccadilly Circus is probably one of the worst places in the world. It’s up there with the Times Square I think, but considering all I’ve just said, London would be a very nice place to live.</p>\n<p>When I moved [to Cairo] from such a different environment as a kid, I adopted this “no” stance, like everything around me is wrong, no: I’m not from here, I don’t belong here. I feel like that’s the kind of attitude that stayed with me on many levels maybe.</p>\n<p><strong>Would you ever consider moving back there, if you could? Or are you happy to stay?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m actually quite happy down there. Not sure happy is the right word, but there’s a lot of things I’d like to stay for. The secret project is one of them and that’s just right now, maybe it never happens, maybe it fails. My parents are getting old, I’d like to be close to them, you know, be present. I visit them more often now and I wouldn’t be able to do that if I lived in another country.</p>\n<p>Another thing, a big thing actually, Egypt’s really cheap. I pay peanuts for rent, man. I have a big flat on my own and my rent is 3500 Egyptian, which is like 160 euros. For the entire flat. So, I wouldn’t be too quick to move. And, this means I can afford being a musician full-time. I gig in Europe or whatever, I come back and I don’t have to work for 6 months sometimes. That’s something important, that’s not something small.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4859/46141988962_30a99981d5_h.jpg\" alt=\"xxx\"></p>\n<p><strong>Do you have any plans for the development of the scene in Egypt?</strong></p>\n<p>You trying to get the secret out of me? [smiles].</p>\n<p><strong>Aha… But is that something you want to do?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah! It’s not necessarily because it’s Egypt and I’m Egyptian. It’s because I know specific people, who are really really good and they deserve to be heard. They are really really great, and not just producers, also DJs. For instance, for my NTS show I started the series now for my favourite DJs from Cairo, <em>The Nile Sessions</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s great to see someone trying to showcase the overlooked talent like that. And you really seem to want to separate your activity from geography or politics.</strong></p>\n<p>At the end of the day, I’m not a specialist. I’m a musician. I have political opinions like any civilian has political opinions. I’m not qualified to do political commentary and then, everything is political anyway. So, what I mean is that just because I’m from a certain place doesn’t mean I have to sound a certain way. The geography doesn’t matter that much in 2018 and yes, this album is about my life in Cairo, but I would make it anyway if I was living somewhere else. It’s more about my life than it is about Cairo. It’s about Cairo’s effect on me.</p>\n<p>I think a good way to paraphrase would be this. That installation I did, <em>The Magma</em>, that is about Cairo. I couldn’t do it in another city because it’s specifically about Cairo in 2018 and how people are boiling. They can’t stand it there, but they are never going to do anything, which is where the metaphor comes from. Magma is a type of lava but the album is about my experience and my surroundings that just happens to be Cairo. Part of the creative process is the isolation and the creative process drives me crazy in a way... So, I would have made the record anyway, but if I didn’t live in Cairo I would have never made The Magma, the installation.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you find the isolation helpful?</strong></p>\n<p>I think it’s necessary for me, but psychologically it’s not good. It’s very heavy and it informs your lifestyle in a way that isn’t very healthy. Yeah, that’s that. Kind of like: I need to do this, but it’s bad for me. That is a big part of the album, I think. That, you know, I can do it, but it is not good for me.</p>\n<p><strong>What kind of isolation is it?</strong></p>\n<p>I don’t even go out of the house. I could, I do, stay in the house sometimes for months. My gym is downstairs, two streets away, supermarket and gym... Sometimes I go out and visit my parents. My girlfriend is very understanding: she comes and visits me. Whenever I can, I visit her. On my way back, I visit my parents sometimes. That’s it really. If I’m not fully immersed in making, it’s not the same. There’s a specific level of detail that I can’t really pay attention to if I’m like going out, and seeing people, and socialising. That’s just me, it’s just a very personal thing. I’m sure it’s not the same for most people, it’s how my mind works.</p>\n<p><strong>Is there anything else you want to say about the album that we haven’t discussed?</strong></p>\n<p>I think we already have a bit, but it’s very personal. The most personal thing I put out to date. The thing about instrumental electronic music is that you aren’t contained by language. You can express things you can’t really verbalise. When you don’t have to verbalise and you don’t have to make people dance, it’s very honest.</p>\n<p><em>'Terminal' is out now on <a href=\"https://u-i-q.org\">UIQ</a>.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/533926830&color=%23646458&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>",

Combining the power electronics of P.Maze and the contrabass of Otto Lindholm, this record is packed with surprising juxtapositions of tone. These textures are punctuated by four separate movements, presenting a narrative arc that bends and creaks like the branches of a tree.</p>\n<p>To help introduce an audience to this music, and to bring a fresh perspective to its unusual timbres, Stefan Rubber has created an algorithmically-contingent mandala which contorts in response to its shifting sound. Rubber writes that the technological abstractions in the video below are meant to work as an analogy to the archetype of the wolf as a symbol of fascination and terror. But for me, these shapeshifting contortions have more in common with the wolf's unnatural cousin: the werewolf.

    "date": "2018-12-31T00:00:00.000Z",
    "content": "<p>We often find the year’s closing article to be the hardest to write. More than a time of retrospective reflection, December has become a month of binge-listening, trying desperately to catch up with the ‘big records’ of the year. The problem with running a music blog is that it assumes a degree of musical omnipotence. If a music blog has any purpose in 2018, it is to provide a platform for artists that is distinct from that of the mainstream media. This requires an appreciation both of the year’s media-adorned artists and those criminally overlooked.</p>\n<p>But the truth is we don’t want to only listen to music from the present. A lot of what we listened to in 2018 came from reissues, old records, genres we never ‘got’ before. Spotify reveals Vikingur Olaffsson’s 2018 performances of Bach’s piano works as top of one of our most played this year: new interpretations of music over 300 years old. We’ve otherwise been revisiting early Tom Waits and Art Blakey records, and other music from years gone by, electronic or otherwise. This isn't because new music is lacklustre or that old music is better. Sometimes taste, fleeting and contingent as it is, is just like that sometimes. This is no bad thing either. After all, those who do not learn from music history are doomed to repeat it.</p>\n<p>It would appear there have been others in a reflective mood this year – in July we were treated to a quiet film about Ryuichi Sakamoto. Entitled <em>Coda</em>, the film charts his rise to prominence with the Yellow Magic Orchestra, through to his battle with cancer and the incendiary works which followed this – his magical collaboration with Carsten Nicolai on <em>The Revenant</em> soundtrack and the meditative <em>Async</em> LP. <em>Coda</em> is a modest, gentle film well in keeping with the man himself, yet has an intimacy to it which feels touching given Sakamoto feels a very private character for the most part.</p>\n<p>One thing that has struck us this year is the role of the record label. In 2018, when most artists begin and continue their careers through online streaming platforms (Bandcamp and Soundcloud, primarily), the status of record labels seems to have changed. But rather than becoming obsolete, labels have renewed their importance as a curational force. Music distribution becomes less about the practicalities surrounding distribution and more about forging a new style or coalescing disparate ideas.</p>\n<p>Athenian label Hypermedium for example have continued to defy expectations this year, hosting the trival-indebted productions of Mexicali producer Siete Catorce following on from their last EP which looked to South Africa’s rich gqom scene. Back in Blighty, TT (formerly known as Tobago Tracks) had a remarkable year with a total of nine indispensable releases, ranging from the esoteric ambient of Litter Frog to the critically acclaimed release from object blue. There has also been some notable activity from longer running labels, Skam Records for example releasing <em>Break Before Make</em> a hypnotic LP of low-slung electro-futurism from Henrietta Rolla-Smith aka Afrodeutsche. Seeing her DJ at Somerset House early in the year marked her out as someone to keep an eye on, playing one of the most enjoyable sets of rugged Drexciyan techno I’ve seen this year.</p>\n<p>While we are cautious around using words like ‘revival’, it's also worth noting there’s been some excellent jungle released this year. In May, Illian Tapes’ Skee Mask released <em>Compro</em> – a glorious mix of thunderous breakbeats and Autechre-indebted melancholia, like a hazy, nostalgia filled recollection of a free-rave many years later. At the other end of the year was Etch’s <em>Ups &amp; Downs</em>, on Sneaker Social Club. “Can you imagine being weightless? Not feeling the pressure of that chair under you...” begins the album’s cleverly used selection of film samples, and so begins the voyage. <em>Ups &amp; Downs</em> is an expertly crafted work, reminiscent of early Photek and the deviant industrial production behind Bad Taste’s Trellion, handling classic jungle and drum and bass tropes with care and precision.</p>\n<p>ZULI is another honourable mention, a producer who released two of 2018’s strongest records. The Cairo-based producer first caught our attention in May with his mind-bending <em>Trigger Finger</em> EP, fusing breakbeats and side-chained sub in genuinely groundbreaking ways. He followed this up with an unexpected debut LP, <em>Terminal</em> on Lee Gamble’s UIQ imprint, completing and perfecting the initial statement made by <em>Trigger Finger</em>.</p>\n<p>There has also been some fantastically innovative work released by Stray Landings favourite, Shelley Parker. Many will have been exposed to her this year following the release of her brooding, dub-breakbeat EP <em>Red Cotton EP</em> on Hessle Audio, yet 2018 was also the year she quietly and modestly released <em>Soundcheck</em>, an inebriated, deep sea exploration through tape-chewed jungle, off-kilter techno and dense, concreté riddled ambient. The title for the EP references Shelley’s experience with a male producer telling her at a gig: “I don’t know if you know how this all works and maybe you’ve never done this before but it’s imperative – imperative – I finish my soundcheck first and you need to respect that.”</p>\n<p>Unfortunately incidents of sexism like the above have continued, and 2018 has been punctuated by some wider structural issues in electronic music. In April, Radar Radio permanently closed its doors after a mass exodus of DJs from the station in response to claims of sexual harassment, racism, homophobia, and transphobia at the station. The details of the allegations and Radar’s ensuing closure have already been written about in great detail, but for anyone who needs updating should head to Ashtart Al-Hurra’s truthful <a href=\"http://mixedspices.co.uk/\">Mixed Spices blog</a> for the full account. If there can be any silver lining to the Radar scandal, it would be the opening of this brilliant new blog.</p>\n<p>Another high-profile case of sexism within electronic music was the ongoing scandal surrounding Konstantin. After his infamous 2017 interview in which he claimed that “women are usually worse at DJing than men”, Konstantin was incredulously invited to play three separate parties at Amsterdam’s ADE festival. The decision was widely criticised and prompted an <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdlGinR6MY4o3hJNzq9kYYAonhB1P8cLyLa9V3fDpqnvzl5Lg/viewform?fbzx=4897567770482994000\">open letter</a> calling for ADE to drop Konstantin from the bill, with over 2000 signatures. The festival responded to the criticism by inviting him onto a panel discussion of sexism in the industry. The reasons for this bizarre move remain known to ADE’s organisers only. With cases like the above still happening in 2018, the importance of groups like female:pressure, who this year celebrated their 20th birthday, feel all the more renewed.</p>\n<p>State politics have also played out this year in a number of incidents connected to electronic music. In May, Georgian police carrying automatic weapons raided two of Tbilisi’s most celebrated (and LGBTQ+ friendly) clubs, Bassiani and Cafe Gallery. The following days saw demonstrations of thousands on the city’s main boulevard, including counter-demonstrations from the city’s far-right. Police claimed that the armed operation was conducted purely for the seizure of drug dealers, but the move was simultaneously celebrated by Tbilisi’s far-right who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/14/georgian-techno-fans-extremists-clash-tbilisi-fight-club-culture\">denounced the ravers</a> as “drug propagandists” and “sodomites”. The future of Tbilisi's gay clubbing scene in light of a burgeoning far-right still remains uncertain.</p>\n<p>In September, a large number of DJs participated in the social media campaign #DJsForPalestine, co-ordinated by PACBI (Palestinian Campaign For The Cultural Boycott of Israel). After DJ collective Room for Resistance shared the campaign, Berlin’s ://about blank club promptly cancelled their upcoming party, citing “irreconcilable differences” between the club and the DJ collective on the question of Palestinian solidarity. The cancellation left Room for Resistance with an outstanding bill to cover the costs of artists' travel fees, time and other expenses, but was successfully covered by a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/r4r-x-comeme-cancellation-fund\">crowdfund campaign</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, this month saw DJ and producer Klaus <a href=\"https://twitter.com/klausmuzik/status/1072126105937686528\">convicted of terrorism-related charges</a> for stopping a deportation flight leaving Stansted Airport. For this act of peaceful protest, Klaus and the other members of the <em>Stansted 15</em> could receive a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. As ‘Brexit Day’ fast looms on the horizon of next year, the antagonisms between music and state are surely due to intensify. But exactly how Brexit impacts the lives of electronic musicians, and the ultimate fate of the <em>Stansted 15</em> in particular, is yet to be seen.</p>\n<p>2018 has seen a string of contradictions and narratives which do not fit together as neatly as we might like. Summarising the year in this way may therefore feel like a last-minute hodge-podge of ideas: the last dregs of Christmas Pudding on the plate. It is also highly unlikely that many of the structural issues mentioned above will significantly change in 2019 either. But we can take some comfort in the endless outpouring of music that is made with passion and love, in spite of the political antagonisms that surround us. If there is one thing that can unite the music we have enjoyed this year, it is a playfulness and risk-embracing experimentation which feels a welcome antidote to the rather professorial swathes of ‘deconstructed club music’ popular this year. As our friend object blue put it recently: “will club music be put back together in 2019?&quot;</p>\n<p>Find a playlist of just some of the music we have enjoyed below, and have a happy new year.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/l1qt73tvj4sttcnkh2azulsya/playlist/4A5nn7XB8N7rbcvAjKVEwt\" width=\"100%\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Alida Bea.</em></p>\n<p>Having contributed our fifth ever mix all the way back in 2011, it's been rather special to see Zak Brashill, aka Etch's career unfold. The mix provided an  insightful look at the history of hardcore and jungle, featuring tunes plenty of seasoned ravers would struggle to list, let alone a first year uni student. But Zak's knowledge of music always seemed to have defied his years. Perhaps this is due to the fact he inherited his uncle's entire record collection in his early teens, the magic of labels like Moving Shadow and Reinforced instilled during his formative years.</p>\n<p>It is this which may have set him apart in an era where many are resurrecting Amen, Apache and Think samples. His early releases on Soundman Chronicles and Keysound could easily have been freshly unearthed gems from the mid-90s – twisted sci-fi samples, spliced and filtered breaks and staggered blasts of sub, meshed together with deft ability. Fast forward to 2018 and we were treated to Brashill's debut album, <em>Ups &amp; Downs</em> on Sneaker Social Club. Crafting a dreamlike narrative somewhere between the club and the inebriated late night bus ride home, the album references a number of classic jungle and hardcore tropes with subtlety, calling to mind stripped-back Photek classics like 'UFO' or 'Ni Ten Ichi Ryu'.</p>\n<p>With the album out for a few months, we caught up with Zak to discuss its development, playing Brighton's notorious Volks on Valentine's Day and the crossover between breakcore and metal.</p>\n<p><strong>I really enjoyed last year's <em>Ups and Downs</em> LP. I know it spans a few years in terms of productions – how did you approach putting it together and what was the process like in terms of making it an album rather than what you'd put out on an EP?</strong></p>\n<p>It was mainly with the assistance of Donga [Ashley Marlowe]. He was the one that initially wanted to do an album with me on his label Gully, all the way back in 2014. He had been a fan of the 12&quot;s I'd already put out and I'd been going to lots of the Well Rounded nights. He asked if I wanted to do an album and I thought fuck it, might as well! It went through lots of iterations – he's notoriously indecisive about picking things out. It got to last year, and that was when Jamie – who runs Hypercolour, Space Hardware and Sneaker Social Club – kind of stepped in to help.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/509475390&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Ash is such a figure in the Brighton music scene.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah he is, he's somewhat of an unsung hero. He's one of the best fucking DJs ever and half of my record collection I've bought or have come from him in some way. He's great.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;I realised all this music I really liked had been around me already.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On a Brighton-related note, I saw you were been booked to play Volks this Valentines Day and wanted to ask about some of your early experiences going out in the city...</strong></p>\n<p>What a place to be on Valentine's Day [laughs]. My friends and I got fake IDs when we were about 15, and just wanted to go out and cause havoc. But I was always the one that was selecting the nights that we would go to. The main one I would get excited about was Super Dub Pressure at Concorde 2, which was run by Unlikely, who now runs Rye Wax in London. They were incredible – they used to bring in a huge rig. I remember seeing Loefah do a three hour straight dubstep set. Some of those nights were just incredible. There was another night called Beat Redemption which was focused on the beat scene at the time. They used to have Kode9, Samiyam and Rafferty – people like that.</p>\n<p>I probably went to Volks around the same time. Volks was always a strictly drum and bass, jungle and breakcore club. It's just the most extreme – I fucking love the Volks. It's got a really bad reputation, but because it does have that reputation, it keeps away certain people and crowds that you don't really want there. The only people that go there are weirdos and it adds to the atmosphere. I really like that.</p>\n<p><strong>It's not in much danger of being Shoreditch-ified. It's the sort of club where you see nights there advertised exclusively on dual-carriageway lampposts.</strong></p>\n<p>One of the main promoters – Voytek – is a good friend of mine. He's had a drum and bass night there for like 20 years now. I was talking to him recently – he went to Berghain in Berlin and I was like &quot;OK give me your honest opinion...&quot; He was like &quot;mate it's just like a giant Volks&quot; [laughs]. I wasn't actually surprised.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/254788090&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>You mentioned breakcore – Brighton has had quite a big scene for breakcore with Wrong Music, DJ Scotch Egg and Shitmat etc. You've become known for working with breaks but how much does that scene feed into it as well?</strong></p>\n<p>When I was in year seven at school I was a goth and was proper into Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson and that kind of shit. I realised it was kind of corny and I was looking for something just dark and hard. That was when I stumbled on breakcore on the internet. The first tune I heard was 'Childkiller' by Venetian Snares. I was hooked and pretty much all I listened to for the next few years was breakcore. That was how I found my way into drum and bass and jungle as well.</p>\n<p><strong>There's kind of an unlikely link between metal and breakcore.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, that's true. There's a breakcore artist called Aaron Spectre who did a project called Drumcorps. He'd sample doom metal and put amen breaks over the top.</p>\n<p><strong>What films and video-games fed into the album too?</strong></p>\n<p>The whole album has samples from video-games and films throughout. It's something I really gravitate towards. Especially with UK hardcore, they were all sampling old films at the time, like <em>Predator 2</em> and <em>Bladerunner</em>. I wanted to bring it up to speed with the times. The things you can take out of video games – you just wouldn't expect how much you can do with them. Like pitching down the menu selection theme in Rayman - you can do so much with sampling. Games fed into that album a huge amount.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/554914560&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>It's interesting because some of the first, weird electronic music I heard was in video-games. They felt much more underground in the early-2000s and before.</strong></p>\n<p>Absolutely. Infact there's this really weird game - I think it only came out in Japan - it's called <em>LSD Dream Emulator</em>. It came out on Playstation 1. There's a remix album with it, and it has remixes from Luke Vibert and Mike Paradinas and all those kind of people on it. There's definitely a big connection there.</p>\n<p><strong>I remember you telling me once how you'd inherited lots of jungle and hardcore records from your uncle.</strong></p>\n<p>My uncle, mum and my auntie were big ravers in the '90s. Even when I wasn't really paying attention to music, that music was around me all the time. Like I said when I was a goth at the beginning of school, that was an image thing. I just wanted to rebel. But as soon as I sacked that off, I realised all this music I really liked had been around me already. Stuff like Altern8, Manix and 2 Bad Mice. When my uncle moved to America, which I think was in 2005, I would have been 13. He left me all of his records and hard-drives full of tunes as well. It was just so much to go through.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ywj6-8yCCfo?controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>He did record art for a few labels too right?</strong></p>\n<p>He started out as a graffiti artist in Brighton, and then he got a job working for a comic strip in Brighton called 2000AD. He got tapped up to do artwork for Ninja Tune. I think he did some stuff for Mo Wax, and he also did stuff for the TV series <em>Spaced</em>. He did all of the drawings that Simon Pegg's character does. He also spray painted the backdrop for The Prodigy's <em>Fat of The Land</em> Tour, he's been involved in a lot of shit.</p>\n<p><strong>On the subject of having that music around you growing up – what's like being in a position where you're mixing in the same circles as those people?</strong></p>\n<p>It's weird. They are so fucking old school, they don't even talk to you on the internet. They're like &quot;what's your phone number bruv?&quot; It's just like I can't believe I'm sitting there talking to Foul Play, or Simon from 2 Bad Mice,  telling me stories about the '90s and raves. I DJ'd with 2 Bad Mice in Berlin two years ago now. It was just surreal. They've got stories for days man.</p>\n<p><strong>And you even had a tune played by Aphex Twin.</strong></p>\n<p>I didn't believe that at first. I remember one of my friends – Darwin – she's a DJ in Berlin. She was going to the Aphex Twin night and messaged me saying she thought she heard my tune. I was just going to bed and thought she was high and went to bed. The next day it blew up and everyone was messaging me [laughs]. That's my least favourite tune on the album too! I made that tune in about 40 minutes in the back of a car on my laptop. What the fuck.</p>\n<p><strong>What's it been like for your uncle seeing you enter the same sort of scene he was working in?</strong></p>\n<p>He's been really supportive and is really into my music. I always send my music to him before I send it to anyone else. He's always been into the newest, most-cutting edge music. At the moment, he's really into all the stuff that's coming out of L.A 'cause he lives in Seattle now. Do you know Tsuruda? It's basically like a progression from Flying Lotus and the beats scene and all that. He's really into that so I feel like I'm lagging a bit!</p>\n<p><strong>I wanted to ask about Bun the Grid and how that started. Did you have serious intentions for it when you began it?</strong></p>\n<p>I mean I've kind of taken a step back from it. It's mainly Dom [Bulu]'s label. It kind of was a bit of a joke in the first place, even the name. It started 'cause I made this track on my lunch break at work, which was 'Yo Yo Riddim'. Dom was asking how I made it because the beat is a bit skew-whiff. I had turned the grid invisible and just sort of put the beats wherever. He was like &quot;oh what, so you bunned the grid?&quot; and that was what he called the label. The first release on that was sort of my doing. I wanted to get Gantz and Moresounds to do the remix, and then the second release was more his doing. Me and Deft did the remixes for that.</p>\n<p>We still discuss stuff and he runs things past me but it's definitely his thing at the moment. He's more into the bangers and stuff that's hard, and he's good at sourcing it.</p>\n<p><strong>What are your plans for 2019? I heard you might be working on something for the WNCL Toolkit series?</strong></p>\n<p>That's gone through so many different iterations already. I can't really make my mind up on what I want to do with it. The most recent one was just hardcore loops. It didn't really fit well... I'm kind of confused where to take it to be honest but I'll get there eventually. I need to be in the right sort of headspace as I have so much other shit going on. But I'm really enjoying working with Bob [Bhamra] because he's fucking wicked. When I had a show on Radar Radio he submitted this incredible psychedelic rock mix.</p>\n<p>I'm also continuing to work with Jamie on stuff for Sneaker Social Club. I've got a grime record coming out with Nico Lindsay on Sneaker Social Club, and am also on a compilation they are doing. The track I just put up on Soundcloud also caught his attention and he's basically just asked for three more of those! It's basically the tune I've been trying to make since I was 15. I don't know how I did it. It made itself!</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/571207494&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>I fondly remember a weekend in 2015 spent dancing in the courtyard of an old factory in downtown Kyiv: in the tiny <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/otelleto/?ref=py_c\">Otel’</a> and, the very next day, in my favourite <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/closerkiev/\">Closer</a>. There wasn’t a forest-facing area yet, nor the record shop or radio station streaming from a <a href=\"https://www.20ftradio.net/\">20ft</a> container nearby, but those two days are still special to me. Not because that was the beginning of the Ukrainian underground scene (it existed long before), but because it was the weekend when I fell in love, irrevocably and unconditionally, with the strobe lights, rough-looking dancefloors and beats of electronic music.</p>\n<p>So, when I heard of the debut EP by a Ukrainian musician Ivan Skoryna, I felt warm because he’s one of the people who shared that experience with me. We haven’t stayed in touch, but somehow we ended up in the same place even though I’ve been living abroad for the last couple of years. His album is mastered by John Object, one of the most notable and weird Ukrainian musical exports, and it’s as harsh and noisy as I like. The four tracks hit the perfect spot between obscurity and melody, and it’s hard not to want to dance to them.</p>\n<p>I remember Skoryna as an intellectual, so I wouldn’t put it past him to make a conceptual album. But he does so in a way that feels natural and not overburdened. The track ‘Love poem’ begins as an altered phone ringtone: 'It’s so nice to wake up in the morning all alone’, say the lyrics, taken from a poem by Richard Brautigan. The track is painful and lonely, but it also makes me feel like everything is going to be okay because it's about everyday and about what it's like sometimes to be alive.</p>\n<p>Either as a critique of consumerism or the reflection of one’s inner state, an iPhone on the album cover is cracked and severely damaged, but ‘nobody’s perfect’, says Skoryna. ‘Nobody’ is moody and atmospheric and a little sinister. ‘Damage’ is squeaky and satisfyingly random. On ‘Sirens’, the stylistically recognisable metal screeches perform inhumanly to the background of impactful industrial techno. This track's textural density and fast tempos produce an emotional response, which reminds me of Ewa Justka and AJA.</p>\n<p>The album is released on a young Czech label Gin&amp;Platonic and fits well among the incredibly solid work being produced and finally noticed all over the globe. At the same time, <em>Damage</em> reminds me that sometimes you don't have to look far. As another famous lyric goes: 'groove is in the heart' and more often than not, it's right under your nose. I'm excited to continue looking for it wherever I am in the world and be sure to remember where it all began for me.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1383829340/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://ginandplatonic.bandcamp.com/album/damage\">damage by ivan skoryna</a></iframe>",

Boredom of sexist DJs; of the financialisation of club spaces; of the lurking police presence; of clubs in general. What they try to offer instead is a night that broadens inclusivity,  where no-one is turned away for lack of funds, and there is free food and condoms at every event. The phrase 'Cherche Encore' means 'to look again' or 'to keep looking'. In this case, Cherche Encore encourages us to see clubbing in a different light: not as passive consumers but as active participants in an evolving social process.</p>\n<p>As well a club night, Cherche Encore also operates a digital label. Their latest release, <em>&quot;Being to the Left of Textor&quot;</em>, comes from ambient musician, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/eyemeasure\">Eye Measure</a>. Some might recognise the Eye Measure moniker through her involvement with new age ambient label, <a href=\"https://newatlantismusic.bandcamp.com/track/eye-measure-true-aloe\">New Atlantis</a>, and their regular showcases together in Peckham’s Rye Wax. But if ambient is meant to denote a sense of calm, this latest EP is anything but. Listen for example to a premiere of ‘The Sacrifice’ from the EP below. Here, the use of closely entwined sine waves creates a creeping sense of disquiet, and the wooden percussion creaks and groans like a ship ready to capsize.</p>\n<p>The EP will be released on Thursday 4th, and Cherche Encore will be celebrating this release with a party on April 6th. The evening will feature performances from Eye Measure, as well as jlte, SQC, aamin, Charles Verni, Daniel M Karlsson, hmurd, and Hortense.

    "content": "<p>Quantum Natives, an alliance of experimental artists, is often defined in relation to its video game aesthetics and digital world-building philosophy. The participants use avatars instead of the media-friendly portraits and its website resembles a map of an imaginary world, rather than a traditional distribution channel. In part, this ideology is what brought the UK-conceived collective international attention. In 2017, the group premiered in the US, where members of the group including Rosen, DeForrest Brown Jr., Brood Ma and Yearning Kru, presented an installation and software programme Grace Nexus. Later on, a second software performance was commissioned by the Netherlands’ avant-garde festival Rewire, featuring recsund, White Goblin, Yan Keen and Yeongrak. The group's affiliates performed at such venues as the ICA in London and were featured on the cover of the Wire, receiving the stamp of approval from one of the most acclaimed gate-keepers there is.</p>\n<p>With the recognition of such sort came a certain type of image: the collective seemed artsy, intellectual, intimidating. But it isn’t the impression I’m left with today. The clarity of what Quantum Natives represents as a project came with a realisation of the virtual realm being not an emulation, but an alternative. I’ve found it curiously suitable to think of Quantum Natives as being like another planet: a place we look to for something that offers another way of life.</p>\n<p>As I think of this, NASA prepares for another Mars mission and the rendered image of their landing site, showing the possible signs of water, looks a bit like (ahem) the map of Quantum Natives. Similarly, Halil Altindere’s recent work 'Space Refugee' uses VR technology to imagine living on the Red Planet. As evident from its name, the piece shows a refugee camp in space, a place where people who are misplaced in this world can finally feel at home. Even though encapsulating the society’s hostility towards the Other, the concept is hopeful. It captures our human quest for belonging, the desire to find a place where we feel welcome, accepted and understood. To me, that’s what Quantum Natives is all about.</p>\n<p>The collective is fluid and its peripheral concepts evolve with time. This finds reflection in the talent roster: there’s no prevailing genre or sound that unites the group, rather an aptitude for fostering and encouraging individual uniqueness. Instead of having any kind of rigid borders, the map of Quantum Natives' world appears not to “load” at the edges, suggesting there will always be more to explore.

    "content": "<p>The relatively young experimental platform, <a href=\"https://www.edited-arts.co.uk/\">Edited Arts</a>, was born out of a friendship between two students and has had an impressive journey so far, establishing itself as a progressive event organiser and filmmaker. Since its conception about two years ago, the organisation has matured and grown in many ways. Instead of throwing house parties, it regularly organises live events at London’s booming venue, The Glove That Fits. Instead of curating a DIY multimedia exhibition at the abandoned police station, it assists in the event programming at the Royal Albert Hall. Instead of filming a graduate art show, it collaborates on a documentary with Resident Advisor. Now, it’s also set to conquer another height and become a label.</p>\n<p>The name 'Edited Arts' refers to the process of continuing to work on something that seems finished, editing it and saving it as a new file. It’s about the process of constant improvement and advancement through building on what’s already there. As such, the platform aims to upgrade the current concept of audiovisual performance by paying special attention to the set design during its events. Similarly, for its very first release, the platform turns to what it already has – a community of long-time collaborators – and comes up with a tracklist full of adventurous talent, enhanced by some really noticeable newcomers.</p>\n<p>The bio of their debut compilation, EXTENDED, purports to &quot;invite musicians, artists and designers to consider the idea of the extended self&quot;. This can be seen in the artists involved, many of whom have been prominent at Edited Arts since near the beginning of its existence. They include Alex Buchan, the artist behind music videos of this compilation, Loraine James, Rave Retirement Community, Keiken, and +777000, who's premiering here today. +777000's input 'Salt Salt’ is a metaphor for the medical use of salt, the painful healing that is heard in the patches of noise on an otherwise ambient track.</p>\n<p>Listen below and look out for a full compilation released on Wednesday, May 15th via <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/editedarts\">Soundcloud</a> and <a href=\"https://editedarts.bandcamp.com/\">Bandcamp</a> with a visual stream available on <a href=\"http://bit.ly/editedextendvid\">Youtube</a>.

This is noise not in the sense of noise-music, but as hype, as furore, as a burgeoning cultural movement. In the 90s, the question was asked in earnest, to find the next party, rave, or sound-system. But today, looking for ‘the next big thing’ sounds more like a marketing strategy.</p>\n<p>Some have argued that ‘hype’ has become an empty signifier for superficial trends and gimmicks: a nightmarish conflation of music and meme. The problem we have now is not so much a scarcity of noise, but an overabundance. The democratising effect of the Internet has enabled a proliferation of new music, and radically new listening practices. So if we want noise, where should we be looking? How can we make sense of it all? Can we find the noise in the ether?</p>\n<p>To discuss all this and more, Georgie McVicar from Stray Landings will be speaking with the following label representatives: Chloe Frieda of Alien Jams, Martin J Thompson of SM-LL, Ophelia Aasa of HOLODISC, and Stephen McEvoy of FLUF.</p>\n<p>Tickets can be bought <a href=\"https://www.cafeoto.co.uk/events/wheres-fucking-noise-panel-discussion-chaired-stra/\">here</a>.</p>\n",

    "date": "2019-06-07T00:00:00.000Z",
    "content": "<p>My favourite band just released their debut album. Great Dad are perhaps best known from the South London band circuit, playing ramshackle shows in venues like Brixton’s <em>Windmill</em> and Deptford’s <em>Sister Midnight</em>, which is where I first heard them. Watching Great Dad play for the first time, I didn’t really understand what was going on. Packed into an overheated basement with some basic live equipment, I couldn’t work out if the indiscriminate nature of their sound was intentional or circumstantial. To be honest, this ambiguity remains unsolved for me. But this is precisely why I have become such a super-fan.</p>\n<p>Unpicking the Great Dad enigma necessitates a close look at their instrumental set up. Their original line-up consisted of a laptop backing track, stand-up drumming, and the occasional flurry of flute. This jarring juxtaposition of tone remains forever at the forefront of their sound. The backing track blares MIDI strings, horns, and percussion: every element is fully present, and every note of their weird harmonic configurations can be heard. Their drumming style is leant back far enough that it is wrong-footing at every step. The choice to play stand-up puts the beat at a different pace from the quantised samples, thudding just behind the beat. Their live flute flurries offer more strangeness to their sound. The flutes appear, in almost cartoonish fashion, at the end of a phrase or line: a little trill to conclude a statement, like laughter following a joke.</p>\n<p>MIDI sounds have gone through a strange cultural loop over the years, from the novel functionalism of Casio keyboards to the knowing referentialism of Windows ’98 vapourwave and retro-fetishism. I first started hearing these sounds in the early recordings of US oddball bands like They Might Be Giants. On tracks like ‘<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro_u6AhcGYo\">Where Your Eyes Don’t Go</a>’, the MIDI saxophones, organs, and pizzicato strings sound like musical ambition over-extending budget, for a band that didn’t care about sounding too naff in the meantime. But as with Great Dad, those naff MIDI sounds become weirdly captivating, and give the perfect backing to the naff social awkwardness of their lyrics.</p>\n<p>Those same MIDI sounds made a renaissance in the early 00s, with grime collectives like Ruff Sqwad making music on Fruity Loops. A lot of those sounds, although radically forward-thinking, retained a quality of ‘classicness’ by choosing not to over-process the textures or remove them from their original context. The textures on ‘<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8tMF191Fd0\">Misty Cold</a>’, or the orchestral hits on ‘<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI6maB3MxaA\">Lethal Injection</a>’ sound like computer game samples, partially because those were the sounds most accessible to the group at the time. Further down the line, on the academic avant-garde of electronic music, composers like James Ferraro (patronisingly?) re-presented these sounds in an artsy, high-brow context. On the legendary <em>Far Side Virtual</em>, MIDI horns and pianos are presented meta-aesthetically, as a birds-eye view on the progress of culture and technology, but losing some earnestness in the process.</p>\n<p>So where do Great Dad stand in all this? Many of the sounds on this album sound like they come straight from the sample packs and Casio keyboards mentioned earlier. But almost every sound on this album remains somehow untraceable: a copy without an original. The album opens with a curious instrumental, ‘Old’, which sounds somewhere between the incidental music of <em>Ocarina of Time</em> and the brash primary colours of Micachu &amp; the Shapes. Then there's the angular riff which opens ‘Bus’, which sounds like an acoustic guitar MIDI-ised into uncanny obscurity. Is that a live recording, a software instrument, or a synthesiser?  I'm still none the wiser after speaking to them about the recording process, in which they told me it was “largely recorded over webcam”.</p>\n<p>Although the musical backdrop of Great Dad is ambiguous, the lyrics are certainly not. Their sardonic takes on life, death, work, and health punctuate these songs with a clarity that brings them closer into focus. Last year, they released ‘1000 Speedboats / Humming’, a single that I <a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/radio/2018-the-year-in-music-india-jordan-new-atlantis-resonance-fm\">argued at the time</a> offered some of the most honest and original music of the year. On ‘1000 Speedboats’, they lament the uncertainty of being trans in the UK today. Following London's Pride parade, they sing “…yesterday was lovely, we all just smiled and screamed; today some guy in the toilets asked what was wrong with me…”</p>\n<p>This new album expands upon these themes with an added intensity. On ’Blood Dirt’, the only song that could really qualify as a single, the lyrics read “you say all your friends are TERFs / but you wanna talk it out and see if we can make this work?” On ‘Dinner’, a fan favourite at shows, we are told “I work in a restaurant passionately, my boss thinks I’m cis, it’s pretty funny to me”. These moments of realism bring the music's ambiguity to the fore; making its contradictions sharper and more difficult to resolve. At the climax of the album, and arguably its strongest moment, ‘Churchy’, the wonky organs and stark lyricism seem to converge on a point of heartfelt sincerity. Here, the listener is given free permission to wallow guiltlessly over words about loneliness and fear of intimacy.</p>\n<p>Great Dad’s eponymous debut lasts only 23 minutes. But this album has more to offer in that time than most have in an hour. At almost every turn there is a novel texture, a different mood, some clever wordplay. They continue to evade easy categorisation by simply refusing to be anything in particular. Indeed, their album launch show last week saw a complete overhaul of their original set-up, losing the samples to introduce bass, guitars, synthesisers, and backing vocals. This commitment to deviancy can make their music difficult, chaotic, and at times utterly infuriating. But those able to withstand the racket are greatly rewarded.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 472px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1583605338/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=de270f/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://greatdad.bandcamp.com/album/great-dad\">Great Dad by great dad</a></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo by Imogen Flynn.</em></p>\n<p>By now, frequent readers of Stray Landings will probably know Machine Woman. Over the past few years, we have reviewed almost every release of hers, covering the “raw and direct” <a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/reviews/for-sweden\">For Sweden</a>, the bump-and-grind of <a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/reviews/genau-house\">Genau House</a>, and the now legendary <a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/reviews/machine-woman-when-lobster-comes-home\">When Lobster Comes Home</a>. For a while it seemed like every release built on the last: immaculate sequels completing and perfecting an initial statement. I remember hearing <em>Lobster</em> when it was first announced with a group of friends. Someone turned to me to ask: is Machine Woman incapable of writing bad music? Two years on, I still don't know.</p>\n<p>Her more recent music has taken an interesting route too. Ambient and abstract sounds have always backgrounded her music, bringing hallucinatory elements to the dancefloor grooves. But these sounds have recently been given centre stage, with a flurry of intriguing experiments. Two weeks ago, she released <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/machinewoman/sd001\">SD001</a>, a strange and alluring soundscape that marks a significant departure from her usual style. But my favourite, 'Have You Been To Salford Shopping Centre, Have You Seen Argos?' retells a first-person story, in the bleak middle-England context of concrete, Argos and Gregg's. It's the kind of setting Peep Show and Alan Partridge get their humour (and tragedy) from: finding the absurd in the banal.</p>\n<p>This weekend will see Machine Woman performing at <a href=\"https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/whats-on/inter\">(-INTER)</a>, a 2-day programme of installations, presentations, panel discussions and live performances exploring image, sound and digital art. In anticipation of this event, we caught up with Machine Woman to discuss Fritz Lang, Star Trek, and Alan Partridge.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/570877362&color=%23945c44&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>So you’re coming back to London! What are you up to here?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah I’m doing a couple of shows here, including one at Somerset House Studios. I actually just moved back to Manchester, I used to live here. And I’m about to start my Rinse FM residency too.</p>\n<p><strong>A lot of people don’t know that you used to play in bands before you were a techno producer - can you explain a little bit about that transition?</strong></p>\n<p>Well that’s easy because I have always played lots of different kinds of music. I don’t really get it when people say they can’t like a particular kind of music or that they are only influenced by electronic music. I’ve heard people say they don’t like country music. But, you know, Johnny Cash is country music. Sure, it’s kind of mean-sounding and dark but it’s still country at the end of the day.</p>\n<p><strong>I think there’s something to be said for all genres of music.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah exactly. Actually some of my earlier electronic music was more ambient, abstract stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>Yeah I’ve really enjoyed your recent ambient pieces, particularly ‘Have You Been To Salford Shopping Centre, Have You Seen Argos?’ It really reminds me of the kind of Peep Show-Alan Partridge mundane humour of British comedy.</strong></p>\n<p>Thank you! I’m actually so glad you said that. I guess there is something quite Alan Partridge about that story. There’s a kind of bleak humour to those spaces, like the one in that song. They have this really 90s concrete functional aesthetic. I can’t actually remember what I was buying from Argos... I just thought ‘well I haven’t made a track in a while’ and I was sat on my bed on Ableton after going shopping. I made it in 5 minutes. I didn’t think people would like it that much. It’s never about how people will see it though, it’s more about how you present your music.</p>\n<p><strong>Are you planning on doing more of that stuff in the future?</strong></p>\n<p>Well people don’t book you for ambient shows, really. If you want to earn a wage, ambient is just not the way to make money on weekends, you know? People can I guess but generally it’s all dance music. I want to dance too but that ambient element has always been present since the beginning. The first track I put on Soundcloud is very abstract and dark. I’m actually thinking about doing some re-releases of my first two cassettes, so that will be coming to Bandcamp!</p>\n<p><strong>I understand ‘Camile From OHM Makes Me Feel Loved’ was also made in five minutes. Do you normally write tunes so fast?</strong></p>\n<p>People are often surprised about that, but in a way, why should it take any longer than 5 minutes? In a really basic sense, when I’m making tracks, I’m on my bed on my laptop. And my neck is going to hurt after a while, so that’s why these tracks have to be made fast.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/pK215Wv/thumbnail-mwpromo2017-copy1-copy-1.jpg\" alt=\"xx\">\n<em>Photo by Imogen Flynn.</em></p>\n<p><strong>I think for me, music which has taken a long time sounds a bit too laboured over, and loses some of the original power. Know what I mean?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah for sure but to be honest, I’m not a very musical person. I use Ableton and use whatever’s on there. But I’m not very good at writing melodies or anything like that.</p>\n<p><strong>Am I right in thinking your moniker comes from the Fritz Lang film, <em>Metropolis</em>?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes but also I also think of it in reference to the Terminator films. That is where the name is from though yes, the machine-woman in that film, with that famous image everyone knows of her coming alive and conscious.</p>\n<p><strong>So would you call yourself a Sci-fi fan?</strong></p>\n<p>I guess so, but is the Terminator really Sci-fi? I don’t know. I suppose it’s borderline. But for me,  I think of Sci-Fi more as like Star Trek/Star Wars kind of stuff, which is not really my scene. No offence to any Star Trek fans though! It’s just not my thing.</p>\n<p><strong>I know what you mean. I guess I’ve been a bit put off by sci-fi subcultures because they can be quite male-dominated spaces.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah you say that although the Star Wars films had some pretty badass women in them. There’s Princess Leia who gets captured by Jabba the Hutt but escapes...</p>\n<p><strong>The gendered element of <em>Metropolis</em> is quite interesting too.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, to be honest I haven’t seen it in a while [laughs]. It’s a long film you know, like over two hours!</p>\n<p><strong>I noticed the hammer and sickle in your Twitter handle, would you call yourself a communist?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, I lived through communism, I saw what happened when it collapsed. So I don’t think it’s a good idea. People sometimes ask me about my politics or the politics of my music but it’s just there in the name you know? It’s in the music.</p>\n<p><em>Machine Woman will be playing at Somerset House Studios this evening, tickets can be bought <a href=\"https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/whats-on/inter\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/608113356&color=%23945c44&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>",

    "content": "<p>Our latest mix comes composer and sound-designer, Jennifer Walton. Following on from our latest Resonance FM show on <a href=\"http://straylandings.co.uk/radio/video-game-music-etch-lucia-chung\">Video Game Music</a>, Walton has made a mix of tracks from Dance Dance Revolution (DDR). To be perfectly honest, this is not a genre I'm particularly familiar with. But thankfully, Walton has provided the following text, to give some context:</p>\n<p><em>I've been pretty obsessed with rhythm game music since i got heavily into DDR around 2 years ago. The crossover of heavy dance genres, gets pushed to a stupid extreme with the removal of a boundary for what is dance-able. The focus becomes how fast someone can physically move their feet or tap buttons rather than any cohesive dancing style. This creates bizarre musical moments, with 32nd or 64th notes becoming the regular division for any element of the song to allow the chart creators ample material to challenge players.</em></p>\n<p><em>Over the years the boundary of physical skill has been pushed so far out, forcing the music to keep up. The original challenge chart in DDR 1 was PARANOIA, a 180 bpm drum and bass  track, in the most recent release the hardest challenge chart is EGOISM 440.. A (you guessed it) 440 bpm song with hideous amounts of slow downs, beat switches and key changes. With this hellbent focus on physical difficulty, when tracks are removed from their charts they become weird disjointed beasts, never settling into a groove or pattern leaving you adrift in a sea of gabber kicks, too fast to ever dream of dancing Hakken to.</em></p>\n<p><em>All tracks chosen for this mix are from mainline Konami games, Dance Dance Revolution, Sound Voltex and Beatmania, with all the tracks being available either on home releases or cabinets. Konami have some of the strictest rules regarding IP and approval, making the fact that these tracks have mostly been created by in house composers all the more bizarre. I often imagine a room full of stock holders nodding along to at Eurobeat version of Mickey Mouse March.</em></p>\n<p>A playlist featuring the in game charts is also available <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLh-uT091YCPcJCp77k3kKi0AUw3whs5tr\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Tracklist</h3>\n<p>DDR EXTREME JP SELECT <br>\nLESSON BY DJ - U.T.D &amp; Friends (DDR A) <br>\nMETALGEAR ～ SOLID Main Theme ～ - ESPACIO BROTHERS (Beatmania 3) <br>\nMickey Mouse March (Eurobeat Ver.) - Domino (Dance Dance Revolution Disney Mix) <br>\nDANCE ALL NIGHT (DDR EDITION) - Sota Fujimori  (DDR 2016) <br>\nFreaky Freak - Kamome Sano (Sound Voltex Booth) <br>\nAce For Aces - TAG×U1 (DDR A) <br>\nCome To Life - ARM(IOSYS) feat.Nicole Curry (DDR A) <br>\nStrobe♡Girl  - colate (Sound Voltex II Infinite Infection) <br>\nEGG - ginkiha (Sound Voltex Booth) <br>\nShe Is My Wife - SUPER STAR -MITSURU- (BeatMania IIDX 22 PENDUAL) <br>\nTaboo Tears You Up 2008 -REDALiCE (Sound Voltex Booth) <br>\nGEROL - Hommarju  (Sound Voltex II Infinite Infection) <br>\nGarakuta Doll Play - t+pazolite (Sound Voltex IV HEAVENLY HAVEN) <br>\n上海紅茶館 ～ Chinese Tea Orchid Remix - Yooh (Sound Voltex II Infinite Infection) <br>\nNEXT BILLIONAIRE - Nana Takahashi &amp; SOUND HOLIC (SDVX BOOTH) <br>\nFeels Seasickness -  かめりあ (Sound Voltex IV HEAVNLY HAVEN) <br>\niLLness LiLen - かねこちはる (Sound Voltex IV HEAVNLY HAVEN) <br>\nFIN4LE - Kamome Sano (Sound Voltex IV HEAVNLY HAVEN) <br>\nENDYMION - fallen shepherd ft.

    "content": "<p>The latest mix in the series comes from Berlin based producer, and self-proclaimed &quot;electric detective&quot;, Nancy Drone. Some may know the Nancy Drone project from her astounding album from earlier this year, <em><a href=\"https://shop.conditional.club/album/displacement\">Displacement</a></em>. The front cover of <em>Displacement</em>, drawn by close friend Melissa Dias-Mandoly, shows an aghast, hovering, dismembered face, in cartoonish anime-style body-horror. Nancy Drone wrote that the artwork is &quot;an accurate representation of me/my sound/mind/concept in general&quot;. Indeed, this is a record full of bold stabs and razor-sharp edits. These fast chops and assemblages give the music a crucial freshness and vitality. It's as if the music itself is capable of slicing you in two. Listen for example, to 'Counter-Productive' or 'Stim De Novo', two of the year's most concept-rich tracks. As William Burroughs once wrote, &quot;when you cut into the present, the future leaks out&quot;.</p>\n<p>To celebrate this release, we asked Nancy Drone to contribute to our mix series. Much like <em>Displacement</em>, this mix presents music that is jam-packed with ideas, all the way from 80s power-pop to jungle and breakcore. In an email exchange, she explained that &quot;it's such a rag tag mix, and tends to bounce around a lot ... kinda like how my head feels all the time!&quot;</p>\n<p>The title of the mix file is 'songsforfeeling', but the sentence remains incomplete for the listener to conclude...

    "content": "<p><em>Philos</em> is the second release from Korean multi-instrumentalist Park Jiha on tak:til, an imprint of the extraordinary globally-minded label Glitterbeat. The label is an ideal fit for Park’s open-minded and open-ended music, which displays an expansive web of influences and yet manages to sound utterly unique and genre-less. Park plays an array of traditional Korean instruments, and the three she plays on this record are the piri, a bamboo flute similar to an oboe; the saenghwang, a mouth organ; and the tanggeum, a hammered dulcimer. On <em>Philos</em> Park plays alone, building the compositions in the gradually in layers. This marks a change from her practice on her previous release, 2018’s <em>Communion</em>, where she worked with an expanded palette and with other musicians to create a more live and collaborative sound. <em>Philos</em>, while a distinct conceptual work, distils some of that earlier record’s ideas across its eight tracks, in the dynamism and diversity of the pieces and in the subtlety with which the music moves from a sense of spaciousness to claustrophobia.</p>\n<p>I first heard <em>Communion</em> knowing nothing about Park, her musical background or the instruments being played. I didn’t know whether the sounds I was hearing were electronic or acoustic, or whether I was listening to a group playing together live or music that had been spliced together digitally. The ambiguity I experienced was well-matched to the blurring of boundaries in the music between genres, between eras, and between indigenous folk idioms and Western minimalism. Park’s music is beautiful, mesmerising, and structurally fascinating, at times sounding totally improvised and at others meticulously arranged. But what makes her music so compelling is how paradoxically futuristic and unfamiliar it sounds.</p>\n<p>Still today some of the most alien and experimental music today is electronic, and new and existing technologies are constantly being pushed to their limits or repurposed to create original and unique new musical forms. But we are now so acclimatised to synthetic sounds that most listeners are unlucky to wonder or care whether the piano they hear in a song they are listening to is an analogue instrument or digital recreation. Digital sounds have lost something of their novelty, and where once electronic bleeps and quantised beats sounded irrepressibly futuristic, portents of a new era of artificial machine music, these days such stereotypical electronic sounds come across as relics from the past, as a retro-futuristic vision of future music. Park’s music can be understood in the context of a nascent ‘post-digital’ music, paralleled across other media and artforms.</p>\n<p>In ‘post digital’ culture, digital media exist alongside analogue and physical tools and formats, rather than simply supplanting them, as technological optimists and pessimists once imagined they would. To make music either completely or partly digital today is not to make a defiant commitment to making futuristic music, but is more likely just the appropriating of the useful tools available for realising one’s creative ideas. Some old stereotypes about electronic music not being ‘real’ music persist, but these prejudices are slowly disappearing and being replaced by a more porous approach to making and listening to music. Park’s music is a thrillingly unique example of such an open-minded attitude, blending traditional and contemporary musical forms to create pieces of music that defy easy categorisation, and which often have more in common with styles of music created with entirely different tools than they do to do those made on the same folk instruments. Park’s music, despite being played entirely on ancient instruments, sounds so futuristic because it eschews the standard tools and tones that have historically signified the future.</p>\n<p>Opening track ‘Arrival’ pairs a repeated, droning motif over a hammered percussive rhythm, an approach Park adopts on various tracks, unfurling simple melodies just enough to create an emotional foothold, but restrained enough to avoid any dissipation of the hypnotic hold of the music’s looping, almost devotional monotony. The most conspicuous track on the record is ‘Easy’, which features Lebanese artist Dime el Sayed reading a fairly anodyne poem, introducing a human disruption to the other-worldliness of the music up to that point. Although the weakest piece on the album, it does not leave the flow of the record feeling disjointed. Followed by a gently dulating transitory two-minute piece simply titled ‘Pause’, the record opens up into a concluding quartet of pieces that submerge the listener in some of Park’s most immersive and mellifluous music. On ‘Walker in Seoul’, a sparse and maudlin melody meanders unevenly, like a distracted pedestrian slipping in and out of sync with the rhythms of the city around them. Like following and final piece ‘When I Think of Her’, it is easy to imagine this music played on synthesisers or as part of a score for a visual work. The fluidity and intangibility of Park’s music makes it easy to imagine in different contexts, and her curious and generous temperament will surely lead to an increasingly diverse body of work and some fascinating future collaborations.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3253763252/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://parkjiha.bandcamp.com/album/philos\">Philos by Park Jiha</a></iframe>\n_Philos_  is available now via tak:til/Glitterbeat on [vinyl](https://glitterbeat.com/product/philos-by-park-jiha/) & [digital](https://idol.lnk.to/Philos).",

    "content": "<p>The title of this discussion comes from Q Bass’ 1991 rave jam, ‘Hardcore Will Never Die’, in which a desperate voice asks the listener: well hardcore did die, so where’s the fucking noise? This is noise not in the sense of noise-music, but as hype, as furore, as a burgeoning cultural movement. In the 90s, the question was asked in earnest, to find the next party, rave, or sound-system. But today, looking for ‘the next big thing’ sounds more like a marketing strategy.</p>\n<p>Some have argued that ‘hype’ has become an empty signifier for superficial trends and gimmicks: a nightmarish conflation of music and meme. The problem we have now is not so much a scarcity of noise, but an overabundance. The democratising effect of the Internet has enabled a proliferation of new music, and radically new listening practices. So if we want noise, where should we be looking? How can we make sense of it all? Can we find the noise in the ether?</p>\n<p>To discuss all this and more, Georgie McVicar from Stray Landings will be speaking with the following label representatives: Chloe Frieda of Alien Jams, Martin J Thompson of SM-LL, Ophelia Aasa of HOLODISC, and Stephen McEvoy of FLUF.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&light=1&feed=%2FResonance%2Fstray-landings-fm-25_07_19-2000-2100%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>",

    "content": "<p><em>Photo © Matthew Smith</em></p>\n<p>It’s 1994. The city feels as if it’s at boiling point. It’s been a tumultuous year so far, one marked by recession, political upset and violent clashes. Now, as the summer months roll in, a blanket of oppressive heat settles on the nation, stifling breaths and shortening tempers. In Autumn 1994, after 18 years of Conservative rule, the arrival of the Criminal Justice Act finally pushes people over the edge. A vindictive response to UK’s burgeoning illegal rave scene, section 63 of the bill set out to ban parties featuring music ‘characterized by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats’. This bizarre act aimed to stamp out drug-fuelled youth gatherings, like those culminating in the 30,000-strong crowd assembled at the Castlemorton Common Festival in May 1992. More than that, the clause sought to suppress the solidarity which these spaces represented.</p>\n<p>Brian Welsh's 2019 film <em>Beats</em> shows us a defiance of this rigid order, mirrored in the film’s monochrome cityscapes, revealing two working-class Scottish lads freed by dance music, and its power to ignite communal euphoria. The film not only looks back at a defining moment in the UK’s clubbing heritage, but also asks deeper questions about what ‘rave’ means today. With the dawn of the New Labour regime in the backdrop, the storyline of <em>Beats</em> tracks a sudden turning point in public political action in the 90s. The Criminal Justice Act sparked outrage and there were ‘Kill the Bill’ protests across the nation, including one on Downing Street in October 1994 that had to be broken up by mounted riot police. Set in the months before the CJA’s enforcement, Beats chronicles the trials of seemingly incompatible best friends Johnno and Spanner in their struggle against the law and class expectations. While Johnno’s middle-class parents strive to shelter their son from certain ‘anti-social’ influences, Spanner’s future prospects look hopeless under the shackles of his abusive criminal brother. Attempts are made to pull Johnno away from Spanner so that he can start a better life in a shiny new-build estate – a stark contrast to the blighted tenements which impound people like Spanner.</p>\n<p>But rave music offers both friends liberation. Banding together in a rally against authority, the pals leave everything behind so that they can reach the ultimate point of transcendence. We’re simultaneously thrown into a revolutionary protest as we follow Johnno and Spanner on their quest for a night of hedonism at an off-the-motorway rave. Joining up with their rave comrades Wendy, Alison and Laura for one special night, the pair brazenly embrace the mantra that &quot;the only good system is a sound system, and if I can’t dance then it’s not my revolution&quot;. This echoes the political slogan wielded by the anarchist Emma Goldman, which affirms how, even a century ago, when Goldman was seeking free self-expression in Russian ballrooms, dance and anarchist politics could collude in a radical synergy. Windows down as the glow comes up over a hill, tail lights glittering behind them, the pair drop a pill before stumbling towards the beats in the distance.</p>\n<p>A dingy corridor leads to a crowded basement where graffiti and sound systems vein the walls. Butterflies revolt in their stomachs as they lose themselves to the smoky fug of sweat and the throbbing bassline of ‘<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dohzrXT09w\">Dominator</a>’ by Human Resource. The venue dissolves into a seething mass of bodies and MDMA-enhanced euphoria. It’s electric. That dancefloor experience is simulated in the film by glitchy full-colour visuals by Weirdcore, the music video director perhaps most famous for the Aphex Twin videos. “That was pure magic back there, Johnno”, yells Spanner emerging from the mayhem, a can of cheap lager in one hand. They are locked together by bonds of love and understanding. Suddenly, the law-enforced crack-down feels distinctly assailable. Suddenly, anything seems achievable.</p>\n<p>The way rave culture is portrayed in the film traces a lineage of radicalism relevant to today. Welsh explains to the British Film Institute how the screenplay had been adapted from Kieran Hurley’s acclaimed stage play: “[t]he biggest thing I was taken with was how Kieran had managed to elevate the story from not just being about two boys going to a party. It was about much bigger ideas of what was happening in post-industrial Scotland and how, almost subconsciously, the rave movement was some reaction to that.” Beats not only captures the hedonistic exuberance of early 1990s rave culture, and how it signified as protest, but also raises questions about changes to public spaces and rave culture today. Shot in nostalgic black-and-white, there’s an end of an era quality to the film’s portrayal of Glasgow’s 90s rave scene. While raving didn’t disappear after 1994, from the second half of the 90s onwards, this form of dance culture inhabits a more corporate clubland, where the experience, as influenced by those legal changes, became more homogenised. Back in the early 90s, being part of a rave was a radical political act – the youth’s ecstasy-fuelled rebellion against Thatcherite ideals about profit and privatisation. The whole scene was very raw.</p>\n<p>Whereas 90s raves fled to the wilderness, a rave today is more likely to take place at a festival or an abandoned warehouse heavily padded with sponsorship and branding. There’s fewer spontaneous mass gatherings and a more restrained DIY infiltration of public spaces. Today, tickets are sold out months in advance, with clubs charging high prices for everything from drinks to the cloakroom. The selling-off of public spaces has left its marks on London’s cultural fabric too; the closure of the DIY music venue Total Refreshment Centre in Dalston last year acted as a symbol for the city’s increasing exclusivity. Once a grotty hub for illegal raves, the Kings Cross area is now under a massive clean-up through a regeneration project set to be complete in 2023.</p>\n<p>It’s strange to think that the corporate new builds, upmarket soap stores and pricey tapas restaurants in Coal Drops Yard were once dirty warehouses packed with sweaty punters dancing to acid house until the morning. But nostalgia for the bygone days of illegality shouldn’t stop us from envisioning new musical futures. The last few years have seen a counter-cultural pushback against this commercialised underground and gentrification; illegal parties are on the rise, and with it, a defiant sense of creativity. It is the physical spaces in these nights that have enabled the experimentation with and cross-pollination of subgenres to exist. Though it’s a hard truth to swallow – that young people are being priced out of rave culture – if even just one of these raves generates a new scene or genre, then perhaps there’s hope for the future, especially in the UK, where Brexit is positioned to hit the youngest and poorest the hardest.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://jubilee-live.flickr.com/65535/48718277623_bcb6989335_b.jpg\" alt=\"xx\">\n<em>Photo © Matthew Smith</em></p>\n<p>Two decades on, oppressive governmental measures like the CJA ironically remain the key drive behind the activism at the heart of rave culture. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/17/beats-film-rave-scene-protest-glasgow\">an interview with the Guardian this year</a>, Hurley compares the protests around the 1994 bill and the Extinction Rebellion (XR) activists of today: “[t]here’s something about the aesthetic of celebratory protest, claiming space and shutting it down, that you can draw directly back to Reclaim the Streets and the party protest moment, and that all comes out of the Kill the Bill protests. There’s a direct lineage.”</p>\n<p>But although both groups share an aesthetic of celebratory protest, the riots of 1994 had embodied an anarchic spirit that went further than the climate change activists’ tamer modes of rebellion: XR campaigners today are known to be co-operative with police, whilst the 1994 protestors had been staunchly anti-police and anti-authoritarian. Back in April, XR tweeted a video of an activist talking about having a chat with the police whilst in custody - something which the Kill the Bill marchers would have explicitly discouraged. More troublingly, reports of XR protestors calling the police on two young people of colour had also emerged. The two were suspected of pickpocketing, and once searched by the police – who discovered nothing – <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SamGSwann/status/1120334329564024835\">were then subjected to immigration checks</a>. Incidents like this reveal the messiness, ideological incoherence, and underlying tensions that inevitably come with such a rapidly expanding movement: one that grew from a select set of activists to thousands of supporters.</p>\n<p>Rave spaces are in their very nature liminal – perhaps even utopian – spaces, which seem to transcend distinctions of race and class. In locations strategically remote from the watchful eyes of the police, it’s possible to imagine and enact open-minded visions of what society could be. But the reality is that, with gentrification disproportionately spreading to poorer London boroughs, not everyone can partake in the euphoria. Until it was scrapped two years ago, the controversial risk assessment form for events, <em>Form 696</em>, was seen by many as a tool by which the police targeted and excluded certain ethnic groups. Nights platforming genres like R&amp;B and Grime were shut down by police, out of fear of safety hazards and even terrorism. Despite the end of this racially biased piece of bureaucracy, black promoters in London still struggle to put on big nights, with some black clientele facing exclusion from certain clubs due to dress codes and overpriced alcohol – symptoms of systemic discrimination that has led to the creation of Touching Bass and Recess, nights aimed at young black clubbers.</p>\n<p>&quot;You often have to go to quite a few venues before you even have a shortlist&quot;, says Jojo Sonubi, founder of Recess. &quot;Even after that, there’s a sense that you still have to convince owners that you’re not going to be a rowdy bunch&quot;. Touching Bass – the South London-based collective, monthly dance, record label and biweekly NTS Radio show – shows that these communities are still finding ways to take up space and celebrate the cross-cultural creative energy that springs from physical encounters. Inhabiting temporary dance spaces like Peckham’s <em>Tasty Bakery</em> and Japanese restaurant <em>Brilliant Corners</em>, they use a text messaging service akin to the 90s rave era to share the night location.</p>\n<p>The political power of rave was highlighted in an exhibition I attended in Berlin a few weeks ago, which told the story of Berlin’s own dance demonstration: <em>Loveparade</em>. In the summer of 1989, hundreds of people lined Berlin’s streets, united by the parade’s leader – Dr Motte – and a mind-bending techno soundtrack. With the opening of the Berlin wall and Germany’s reunification on the horizon, the capital’s club scene took advantage of the situation to celebrate a new zeitgeist of creativity as well as its new electronic music. Though not free from commercialisation and the problematics of drug abuse, the dance festival appeared as an injection of a fresh and ground-breaking culture – a feeling of freedom summoned up in Dr Motte’s prayer:</p>\n<p><em>To the spirit of the rave, <br>\nTo party people everywhere, <br>\nTo all musicians who create this music, <br>\nAnd to those who play it at the parties, <br>\nTo our special earth, <br>\nTo music itself, <br>\nAnd to the highest spirit – <br>\nMay all people be happy</em> <br></p>\n<p>Adopting the motto <em>Friede, Freude, Eierkuchen</em> (‘Peace, Joy, Pancakes’), the <em>Loveparade</em> united dance with philanthropic sentiments – a community of ravers tied together under the banner of love. But the parade soon came under fire when this very community also began to see how the event organisers reaped profits from licensing, advertising and merchandise sales. The popular <em>Loveparade</em> was at risk of losing its distinctive political dimension. This drove many hardcore techno heads to distance themselves from the event, with some even forming an annual counter-festival in 1997 known as <em>Fuckparade</em>, which turned towards a darker and more aggressive sonic universe with music north of 180 BPM: gabber and terrorcore. The countermovement sought to return the rave to its original discomforting underworld – dank basements, decrepit former theatres and industrial warehouses – and circulate countless slogans like ‘Terror Worldwide’ and ‘Terror for Fun and Profit’ printed on extreme sportswear. That the <em>Fuckparade</em> brings together multiple fringe groups in protest against the gentrification of German clubs demonstrates the fluidity and all-encompassing spirit of the movement.</p>\n<p>Stripped down to <em>‘music itself / And to the highest spirit’</em>, <em>Beats</em> too stands as a timely reminder of the sacred space of rave in the 1990s and the current socio-political moment. For millions born in the 80s, acid house and rave united myriad causes through a passion for electronic music, regardless of race and class. The Prodigy’s ‘Wind It Up’, featured on the film’s soundtrack, samples Anthony Johnson’s ‘Equal Rights’ – capturing the ethos of rave that still seeps into people’s lives today. But it’s also important to address the factors that are pushing marginalised communities out of this vibrant club culture – to embolden the movement with our shared wisdom, to learn from the energy, the ideas and the excitement of those involved; to work together to make a more inclusive, stronger movement. In that way, rave becomes as much a form of escapism as a means of sparking real change.</p>\n",

The pair have spent the majority of their partnership working on comatose hip-hop with a variety collaborators as Baconhead.</p>\n<p>‘Butter’ however marks a fairly large departure from this. While there are nods to their earlier productions here and there, the album is concerned much more closely with rave and club scenes – '95 hardcore tape chewed through distorted breaks, reminiscent of the Wrong Music or early Planet Mu scenes.</p>\n<p>Other tracks take their cues from footwork, such as the adrenalin pumped ‘Emeralds’ or brain-churning ‘Creeps’. Then there is ‘Helsinki’ – an Autechre reminiscent digital maelstrom, which wouldn’t sound out of place soundtracking David Cronenberg’s ’Scanners’.</p>\n<p>The album shines brightest however in its use of classic breaks. Opening track ’Artura Flip’ makes an incendiary launchpad for the LP, with a hectic splice and dice of the classic ‘Think’ break, interspersed with rollicking stabs and sub-atomic bassweight. ‘Crewcut Apex’ is another standout moment and one of the album’s most frenetic tracks. Snares jostle for space amid thumping blasts of low-end, screeching glitches and ruptured melodics.</p>\n<p>‘Butter’ scarcely lets up until reflective closer ‘Delilah’ – the smoke washed afterglow of what has come before, recalling post-club sunrises and inebriated stumbles home. The album is a masterfully executed mission statement for the duo's next chapter together and a welcome reminder of how inventive, technically rich and exciting club music can be.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/793932133&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\"></iframe><div style=\"font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;\"><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/brainraysandquiet\" title=\"Brain Rays & Quiet\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\">Brain Rays & Quiet</a> · <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/brainraysandquiet/ataru-flip\" title=\"Ataru Flip\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\">Ataru Flip</a></div>",
