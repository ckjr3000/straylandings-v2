blockquote: "It was only going to be a matter of time before I tried my hand at it so it was just part of the natural process" Airsilk responds when asked about his first forays into production. Whilst he doesn’t pinpoint exactly when he began toying with production software, his compositions are more telling; carefully constructed webs of noise and found sounds come together in a way which suggest he has been working on the project for some time. "I used to DJ under a different name but I’ve never put any tracks out before" he expands. "The Airsilk project has only come about in the past few months - I figured it was about time I started getting myself out there and see what people thought."

"It was only going to be a matter of time before I tried my hand at it so it was just part of the natural process" Airsilk responds when asked about his first forays into production. Whilst he doesn’t pinpoint exactly when he began toying with production software, his compositions are more telling; carefully constructed webs of noise and found sounds come together in a way which suggest he has been working on the project for some time. "I used to DJ under a different name but I’ve never put any tracks out before" he expands. "The Airsilk project has only come about in the past few months - I figured it was about time I started getting myself out there and see what people thought."

The timing of the project is likely not incidental either, having moved down to the capital from his hometown of Leicester in the last few years, his studies have drawn him further into the world of sound-design.

"I’m really keen on using elements from sound design and noise music because I think using those kind of techniques create a unique, organic quality that’s difficult to replicate" he speaks of the writing processes used on the project. "I’m always looking to record or find interesting field recordings, especially as you can discover weird artefacts in the recordings to use too. I find it rewarding to create sounds in my tracks from odd, non-descript sources."

His mix for us is not for the faint hearted, distorted, full-throttle techno is maintained across its duration, including tracks from the likes of Metrist, Ontal and Catch, alongside several unreleased Airsilk productions.
