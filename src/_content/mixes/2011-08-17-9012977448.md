Blending soulful R&B vocals with atmospheric reverberating percussion, combined with intelligent synth play, Bwana is known for his mixture of dance friendly rhythms and evocative melodics. Make sure to look out for forthcoming releases on ‘Infinite Machine’, featuring some of Micay’s most well regarded tracks such as _It Ain’t Over Till It’s Over_ and _When There Is Nothing Left_.'

Hailing from Toronto, Canada, twenty year old DJ and producer Nathan Micay aka ‘Bwana’ has been making a big name for himself in a very short space of time. Blending soulful R&B vocals with atmospheric reverberating percussion, combined with intelligent synth play, Bwana is known for his mixture of dance friendly rhythms and evocative melodics. Make sure to look out for forthcoming releases on ‘Infinite Machine’, featuring some of Micay’s most well regarded tracks such as _It Ain’t Over Till It’s Over_ and _When There Is Nothing Left_.

The following mix from the now Leeds based producer explores the deeper end of the bass music scene, featuring tracks from the likes of Koreless, Jacques Greene, The Weeknd and Fantastic Mr Fox. Also look out for some slyly placed soundcloud favourites from Bwana’s contemporaries such as Arae and Bondax.
