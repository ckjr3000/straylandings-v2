blockquote: Long standing Brighton based producer Zak Brashill aka ‘Etch’, brings us this phenomenally educational mix of old school rave and jungle tunes from the 91-92 golden era. Compiled largely from a collection handed down to him by his Uncle, this mix displays the early purer sounds the rave scene was originally built upon. Expect some classic names such as Carl Cox, Altern8 & Manix.

For those of you that are unfamiliar Etch he has releases out on ‘Vekta Records’ and is working closely with the wonderful US site ‘WeAreRebels’ and has releases out via them also. It is also worth tracking down Zak’s other alias’s as he creates jungle under the monika ‘Baxman Riddim’ and hip-hop under ‘Slice Provider’. Zak will be playing our opening Stray Landings Night in Brighton at ‘The Jazz Place’ tomorrow night.
