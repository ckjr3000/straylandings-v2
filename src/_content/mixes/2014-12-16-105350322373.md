blockquote: You’d be hard pressed to discuss the Swedish techno scene without DJ and Kontra Musik founder Ulf Eriksson cropping up at some point. Whilst remaining free from the shackles of any one genre, exploring electronic music of all natures, through the label Eriksson has also sought to promote those artists local to him. Rivet, Andreas Tilliander (TM404/Mokira) and Patrick Skoog (Agaric) have all made repeat appearances on the label, helping to define Kontra as a label of near unlimited boundaries.

You’d be hard pressed to discuss the Swedish techno scene without DJ and Kontra Musik founder Ulf Eriksson cropping up at some point. Whilst remaining free from the shackles of any one genre, exploring electronic music of all natures, through the label Eriksson has also sought to promote those artists local to him. Rivet, Andreas Tilliander (TM404/Mokira) and Patrick Skoog (Agaric) have all made repeat appearances on the label, helping to define Kontra as a label of near unlimited boundaries.

With an extended feature on Eriksson and the label currently in the works, we decided to share this recent mix from the Malmö resident, spanning forty five minutes of glacial house & techno, including an array of Kontra favourites both new and old.
