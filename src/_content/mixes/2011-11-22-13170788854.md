blockquote: George McVicar aka ‘Ka’ generously graces us with this astonishing hour long mix, spanning a variety of deep electronic soundscapes, fluctuating between club sounds and more reflective textures. You can also expect plenty of Ka’s own exclusives including his recent collaboration with co-producer Ano. After previously working through the Brighton band scene with his outfits ‘Prince Harry’ and ‘Tender’ George McVicar is currently focusing his attention on a variety of dancefloor productions, that seem to get better with every new release.
