Studying in Falmouth, he set up Static Fields after listening to friends shows, and is now churning out a mix a week. His Stray Landings donation comes in the form of the third in the ‘Nocturne’ series. The Nocturne podcasts are used as an outlet for the best in experimental ambient music, away from Static Fields usual selections of Dubstep & Techno. Look out for plenty of Tim Hecker, along with some names you might not be so familiar with.'

Our ninth mix comes via the man behind ‘Static Fields’ blog, Joshua Smith. Studying in Falmouth, he set up Static Fields after listening to friends shows, and is now churning out a mix a week. His Stray Landings donation comes in the form of the third in the ‘Nocturne’ series. The Nocturne podcasts are used as an outlet for the best in experimental ambient music, away from Static Fields usual selections of Dubstep & Techno. Look out for plenty of Tim Hecker, along with some names you might not be so familiar with.
