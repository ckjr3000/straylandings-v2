Eighteen year old producer Metrist has also been developing a growing following for his grainy, warehouse strength, big room techno. Having secured a release for his track _Argent _with recently founded imprint Nineteen89, the Cambridge bred producer has been racking up some more than respectable support from the likes of Dark Sky, Mary Anne Hobbes, and most recently Skream.

Making up the eleventh of our podcasts, Metrist’s mix comprises of both the old and the new, blending crumbling techno from veteran names such as Regis, Marcus Suckut and Shifted with Metrist’s contemporaries, Ghostek, Happa, Rumah and Kam-Moda. Clocking in at just over thirty minutes Metrist’s mix is fairly concise, condensing the sounds promoted through his work as a producer.
