Stockholm-based W-I, or 'Worldwide International', have been releasing digital obscurities since late-2014.  Founded by Oli XL, the label is well-versed in the kind of bugged-out takes on grime and trap we have seen from labels like PAN and Staycore in recent years. Yet there is also a more tender side to the imprint. 

This dichotomy is well explored on their latest EP, 'Worldwide Recycle Service 02'. There's a taste of V/Vm to the series; it sees an assortment of artists armed with stems for W-I's entire catalogue, to do with what they will. This could mean remixing a single track, or it could mean frankensteining components from several works. For this edition, Oli XL contributes a track alongside Celyn June, N1L & Kablam.

Throughout the release there is a heavily sedated atmosphere. Take Kablam's 'Mouthing (Recycled)', pitting acid-washed synth textures against barrages of jagged-edged percussion, high-sheen vocals rupturing through the mist like a summer blaze through the trees. N1L's 'Sub-Zero' deploys similar tactics, anime-style dulcet tones and tight reverberation building to a subatomic drop, as thudding kicks and aqueous bass textures explore cavernous settings. 

Then there is Celyn June's offering, 'Drivers', calling to mind the stoner ambient of Yves Tumor's _Serpent Music_ LP from earlier this year. Faded orchestral timbres and quayside sound-design work together cautiously. The offering could soundtrack a dream sequence in one of the early seasons of The Sopranos; spaced-out and unsettled, yet there are signs of familiar settings in the backdrop (I'm thinking of the one where Tony gets diarrhoea and talks to a fish).

Oli XL seeks to shake things up as the EP comes to a close. 'Rogue Idiot Pt.2' is a vicious, stripped back rhythmic exertion, stuttered kicks and diced up vocals showing something in common with footwork's approach to production as much as anything else. As the track comes to a close it begins to stumble over itself, staggering to a discordant close, Radiophonic Workshop style.
