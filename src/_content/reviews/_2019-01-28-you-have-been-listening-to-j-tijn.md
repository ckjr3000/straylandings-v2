West Norwood Cassette Library (WNCL)'s latest venture provides a novel meeting of 'DJ tools' and library music in the abstracted field-recordings and electroacoustic oddities sense. So far, contributors have included the likes of modular enthusiast Ekoplekz and jackhammer techno producer C.E.O, offering up twelve two minute tracks of WNCL-brand electronic deviance.

With no discredit to previous offerings, it is fair to say the latest deserves a little special attention. As the name might suggest ‘You Have Been Listening to J.Tijn’ marks the dispatch from Jesse Kuye’s J.Tijn moniker, as the London based artist moves on to pastures new. 

Retiring a moniker that has accompanied Kuye through his early grime and dubstep indebted productions through to releases on Pennyroyal, Naked Naked and Bedouin and shows everywhere from Panorama Bar to Corsica Studios is a bold step.
