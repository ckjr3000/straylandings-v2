Spidery
Cascading/falling down the stairs  Tolkachev’s third LP forms his most exploratory yet. 

It should really come as no surprise that Tolkachev does his own photography. A little too abrasive for a dance-floor, his brand of techno dwells in avant-garde peripheries. This record in particular sounds like a horror movie soundtrack for 5am sessions. Think Eomac & Nov29Films. The synths are sticky and hair-raising, like gloop oozing from decaying vegetation. This is no mistake. Look, for example at the sleeve art, or the album name. If ‘when you are not at home’ is the opening clause, the sentence may as well conclude with ‘…Kafkaesque cockroaches made of bread smother your loved ones.’
