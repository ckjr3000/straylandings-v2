    The artwork for Third Type Tapes' releases reminds me of those posters for garage raves you sometimes see off the M25. It's hard to know quite who their aimed at when your main eyeballs are going to long-haul truck drivers and traffic cops, and even more baffling considering anyone travelling at a sensible pace is going to be hard pressed to absorb the address, lineup and timings as they whizz past. That said, their designs have a certain charm in their directness.
