_A Music Of Sound Systems_ is a little different from what I've come to expect from Matt Spendlove, aka Spatial. I was first introduced to his work through the jaunty, disco-fuzz EP he contributed to West Norwood Cassette Library in 2013. In contrast, this latest release, which makes up his debut LP is all about reduction, texture and inescapably physical low-end frequencies.

Given, much of his other material, such as the 'Emergence' series he propagates via his label Infrasonics is somewhat closer to the material contained in this latest album, it still feels like a notable departure. '291 Anu' clatters and scrapes across the stereo field, like a radio hovering between stations. 'Isotope Scan' on the other hand calls to mind the desaturated dub-techno musings of an artist like _ or _.
