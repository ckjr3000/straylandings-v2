blockquote: "Maxime Corbeil-Perron and Félix-Antoine Morin have released an intriguing new record with Ambiances Magnétiques: 'Political Ritual'. The record presents two 20-minute pieces that work more like 'sound sculptures' than songs. They take as their subject the detritus of sound, the unwanted buzzes and resonances of technology. On _Political Ritual_, these sounds move from the corners and rubbish bins and into plain sight. You are made to confront sound as it really is: caked in surface noise and sonic debris."

Maxime Corbeil-Perron and Félix-Antoine Morin have released an intriguing new 12" with Ambiances Magnétiques: _Political Ritual_. The record presents two 20-minute pieces that work more like 'sound sculptures' than songs. They take as their subject the detritus of sound, the unwanted buzzes and resonances of technology. On _Political Ritual_, these sounds move out of the corners and rubbish bins and into plain sight. You are made to confront sound as it really is: caked in surface noise and sonic debris. 

_Political Ritual_ is a record of two halves. The first, 'Cérémonie', judders like a truck over bumpy terrain. There are moments of what sounds like hyper-engineered studio-production trickery. But in fact, many of these are from acoustic sources, like cellos and organs played in unorthodox styles. There is even the introduction of "a wedding harmonium bought from an old man in an Indian village". 

The unanswered questions left by 'Cérémonie' are concluded by the record's second half: 'Projection Cathodique'. Here, elements of traditional 'musicality' creep in, like the bassline that broods over the piece. The 'politics' of _Political Ritual_ remain somewhat unclear, but its ambiguity is addictive.
