blockquote: Late last year [Amadeus Records](http://amadeusrecords.net/) was launched by the authors of Californian based art & music publication, [Rebel Magazine](http://www.wearerebels.com/). Alongside the birth of Amadeus an elusive new producer has emerged. Working under the name Lawrence Black he focuses himself on producing deeply emotive house. Whilst there is little material available online from Lawrence Black, we did manage to dig out this wonderfully rugged piece of throbbing House via his [soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/lawrence-black). ‘Jess’ Groove’ builds off repetitive synth stabs and shudderingly deep kick bumps. The track distinguishes itself from others with a gritty,  distorted snare, riding on the off-beat. This gives the track a unique flex & groove, something akin to the twitch of 90’s garage, albeit obviously in a wholly new setting.

At 118bpm Jess’ Groove is a relatively slow House track, and doesn’t feel over complicated. This is probably just as well as it allows Black to make the most of some wonderfully expressive soul vocals, a staple of his productions. Whilst we can’t reveal a lot about this talented new producer, we can let you know that alongside working with Amadeus Lawrence Black has a forthcoming vinyl only release on a Manchester based imprint.
