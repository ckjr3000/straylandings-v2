The latest mix in the series comes from Berlin based producer, and self-proclaimed "electric detective", Nancy Drone. Some may know the Nancy Drone project from her astounding album from earlier this year, _[Displacement](https://shop.conditional.club/album/displacement)_. The front cover of _Displacement_ shows an aghast, hovering, dismembered face, in cartoonish anime-style body-horror, as if the music itself will cut you apart and put you back together again before you know what's happened. And indeed, this was an eager and vital record, full of bold stabs and mesmerising studio trickery.
