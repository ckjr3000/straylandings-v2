blockquote: Released on the first imprint of up and coming London based label - 3rdeyeldn, ‘See You Again’ takes a wonky trip through loose melancholic synths, and downtempo, rolling percussion. With nods towards garage, downtempo, house and ambient ‘See You Again’ epitomizes many of the Genre’s explored by the young label developed early this year. The opening thirty seconds features a slow tempo build of thick arpeggiated synth notes, acting as a slow awakening before launching you into the rhythm. ‘See You Again’ is extremely diverse percussively, featuring a multitude of shakers, tinny snares and intensely reverbed claps.

Released on the first imprint of up and coming London based label - 3rdeyeldn, ‘See You Again’ takes a wonky trip through loose melancholic synths, and downtempo, rolling percussion. With nods towards garage, downtempo, house and ambient ‘See You Again’ epitomizes many of the Genre’s explored by the young label developed early this year. The opening thirty seconds features a slow tempo build of thick arpeggiated synth notes, acting as a slow awakening before launching you into the rhythm. ‘See You Again’ is extremely diverse percussively, featuring a multitude of shakers, tinny snares and intensely reverbed claps.

Dosage’s synth work also remains characteristically on point, perhaps the highlight feature of this track for me, being the futuristic warbling organ chords. With a variety of different melodic devices working together at the same time, Dosage places these varying distances in the mix, making the most important driving features stand out clearly.

Underneath the moniker, Dosage is 17 year old art student Ben Swanwick currently studying at Watford. Having a close relationship with the 3rdeyeldn crew, Swanwick has an upcoming track titled ‘I Want You Back’ for the next Imprint being developed by the label. Swanwick will also hopefully be performing at the launch part for this latest compilation, whilst further developing his genre-challenging music.
