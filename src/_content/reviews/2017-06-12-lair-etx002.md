There have been many facets to the career of Ian McDonnell aka Eomac. As part of Lakker he crafted '90s Warp-style percussive abstractions, while as a solo artist he has delivered everything from pulverising 4am warehouse hedonism to the more conceptual broken-beat experiments found on his Bedouin releases. Given this, upon hearing about the establishment of 'Eotrax', his own label last year, I was unsure as to what direction it would take.

From what's been shared so far, it's going to be a bit of everything. The debut 12", 'Temple Of The Jaguar' dragged Eomac down to gothic netherworlds; tightly meshed rhythms skidding between contorted vocals and screeches of distortion. If ETX001 was about violently exorcising inner demons, the next offering from Laura Kilty, aka LAIR provides a therapeutic remedy. This should come as no surprise however, as Kilty describes herself as a "producer, vocalist, artist, sound-healer and yoga teacher" professing an interest in both meditation and psychoacoustics.

Despite the EP's meditative qualities however, there is also a darker side to the release. Opener 'Invoke' and 'Meld' build to discordant _2001_ style vocal climaxes, crumbling electronics and plaintive harmonics lingering in the backdrop. The 12" also comes backed with a cathartic re-imagining of ''Meld' from Sandwell District veteran Rrose, crafting characteristically grinding low-end and construction-site drones from Kilty's original. 

The closing track, 'Searching In Circles' however, is undoubtedly one of the EP's highlights. Vocal loops unfold slowly, tremoloing gently between cave-dwelling percussion. The effect is both soothing and hypnotic; an excellent example of electronic music's potential medicinal qualities.
