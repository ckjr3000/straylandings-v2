It should come as no surprise that Anthony Child — better known as Surgeon — makes music beyond the confines of his trademark industrial techno. Child can now boast over two decades of honing his craft and this has made him a rightful heir to acclaimed status. But once you open for Lady Gaga, where can you go from there? Nowhere. Exactly. So where most would ride a glorious wave of techno super-stardom, Child has begun to explore the other corners of his creative imagination. 

Under his birth name, a series of oddities and collectibles can be found. Last year, he released an ambient album recorded in the Maui Jungle.

In an interview with The Quietus, he explained: "To be honest, I'm much more at home [in Islington Mill] than in a nightclub..."

Even by Child’s standards, it is maximal in its minimalism. Too aggressive as background music, too stark as a focal point. It exists in some curious netherworld. It’s like the sound of a synthesiser left over night, humming in its idleness. As each repetition of its warbling sequence passes, the sludge seeps deeper into your cranial nerves. As Rrose put in a one line review: “It feels like this music has been injected directly into my mind..."
