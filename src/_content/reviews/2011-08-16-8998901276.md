New York based producers Andrew Siedenburg & Alberto Hernandez make up downtempo electronica outfit ‘Background Sound’. The duo, who formed earlier this year, focus themselves on deep Mount Kimbie-esque synth driven garage. They have recently been causing a significant stir, leading to a Rinse FM spot courtesy of DJ extraordinaire ‘Oneman’.

In April they brought us this hypnotic rolling garage refix of the Falty DL tune ‘Brazil’, for the Falty DL remix competition. The remix maintains a wonderfully strong sense of rhythm and groove, whilst remaining tastefully sparse and minimal via twitching drum sounds; helped along by airy throbbing synths. Perhaps the extra rhythmic punch comes from ‘Background Sound’s’ heavily mallet-ed instrumentation, driving the piece forward rhythmically and adding texture to those beautifully reworked steel drums.

Background Sound manage to bring a sombre, melancholic edge to the Falty DL original, turning Lily Mackenzie’s soulful vocals into haunting aural slices eased in and out of the mix.
