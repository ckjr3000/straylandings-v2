1) A lot of your recent work has taken your voice as the central instrument. Can you explain the kinds of vocal processing that is going on? 

2) It feels like this is quite a big departure from Drono in terms of the writing process. How did you go about writing this material? 

3) Can you tell me a little bit about the collaboration track with Banx?
