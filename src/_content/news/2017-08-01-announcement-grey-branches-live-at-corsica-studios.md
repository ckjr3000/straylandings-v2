Hosting events between London and Berlin, techno promoters  Samsara Sessions recently announced the debut of a new venture, Samsara Experiments. Taking over London's Corsica Studios on September 13, the outfit will bring three live acts to Elephant & Castle's favourite railway arch establishment. 

Polish noise musician, strobe contortionist and instrument maker Ewa Justka and Brooklyn's Antenes, making her London debut, will join headliner Yves De Mey, operating under his Grey Branches alias.

Grey Branches emerged in 2014 on AnD & Tom Dicicco's Inner Surface Music imprint, with the 'Lower Bounds' EP. The project was intended as an outlet for Mey to explore more overtly dancefloor productions, albeit retaining his sluggishly contorted electronic signature. Earlier this year, this was followed up with the _Neuroclaps_ LP. Once again released via Inner Surface Music, the album aligns fractured, Gescom-reminiscent modulations with razor-wire breaks and fuzz-caked electronic abstractions in one of the most visceral and exciting cuts from Mey's discography to date.
