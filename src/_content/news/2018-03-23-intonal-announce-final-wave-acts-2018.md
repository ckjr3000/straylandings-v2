Malmö-based experimental music festival Intonal continues to push the boundaries of expectation with the announcement of the final wave of acts for this year’s edition in late April.

Deena Abdelwahed, who released the beguiling fusion of futurist club music and Middle Eastern tonalities ‘Klabb’ on French label Infiné last year, will perform on Friday 27 April at Inkonst. Additionally, Austrian avant-guitarist Fennesz, Morphine label boss Rabih Beaini and Jamaican dancehall duo Equiknoxx will also be joining the bill for Intonal, which runs from 25 to 30 April. Comprising Gavsborg and Time Cow, plus collaborators such as Shanique Marie, Bobby Blackbird and Kemikal Splash, Equiknoxx released the _Colon Man_ LP late last year, a convention-defying exploration into stuttered bass-heavy dancehall. The group’s distinctly leftfield electronic take on a range of Caribbean styles has seen them booked at festivals such as Unsound and attracted remix treatment from Hardwax founder Mark Ernestus. 

Intonal have also revealed further details about previously announced acts, revealing that Pan Daijing and Group A have both developed their performances specifically for this year’s Intonal. Andreas Tilliander has also unveiled his plans to close the festival with a “six hours sleeping concert” entitled ‘Slumbering Sounds and Drowsy Drones’, which will see him “live-tweaking” sounds composed with the aid of random generators.
