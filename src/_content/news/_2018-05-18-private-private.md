The newly formed Lowlife Cartel imprint have returned with another compilation, this time featuring an impressive roster including Buttechno, Fmy, Sammy T Thompson, Machine Woman, PRESENTE and Voyd. In an exclusive for Stray Landings, we can share a stream of Machine Woman's 'Mr Hodge Appreciation Society'. 

This latest release will mark the next in a series of impressive, nearly flawless, 12"s from Machine Woman, from _For Sweden_ in 2016 to _When Lobster Comes Home_ last year. 'Mr Hodge Appreciation Society' is a step into more extreme territory, with a heart-racing tempo and piercing dial-up tones that jump out at jaunty angles. There's even a donk. 

_'Dragged Shed Impressions' will be out on June 18th, pre-order a 12" [here](https://lowlifecartel.bandcamp.com/album/dragged-shed-impressions), limited to 200 copies._
