Berlin-based label Morphine Records have always had an ear for the eclectic. Founded by Rabih Beaini (aka Morphosis) in 2005, the label has released all manner of experimental extremities, from the psyched-out hip-hop of Madteo's _Memoria_, to more academic leaning releases from figureheads like Pierre Bastien or Pauline Oliveros.

Most recently however, Beaini has been tackling Indonesian Gamelan, releasing some fascinatingly rich and intricate works from the likes of Wukir Suryadi, Senyawa and Rully Shabara. 

Supporting this interest, Morphine have announced a five part event series hosted at Berghain, entitled _Ruang Raya_. The series, run in collaboration with Europalia Festival, will showcase a range of Indonesian musicians and composers, bringing together a number of the performers who have featured on Morphine in the last few years.

The first event is entitled 'Moondog for Gamelan', taking place on Thursday 19 October. Find tickets and more details on the Raung Raya [event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/1971256646481784/), or via [Resident Advisor](https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1014119?p=Ticket-Global), where a ticket bundle for all five events can be purchased for â‚¬60.

Find full event details below:

###Moondog for Gamelan
8.00pm on Thursday 19 October 2017

Iwan Gunawan and his ensemble will join Stefan Lakatos, performing a selection of compositions from the seminal _The Viking Of Sixth Avenue_, on specially built well-tempered bamboo Gamelan.

###The Magic of Sunda
Wednesday 15 November 2017

If you trace back far enough, Sunda is actually the ancient name for the archipelago known today as Indonesia. This event promises to represent a less traditional facet of Indonesian music, hosting Karinding Attack, a group comprised of ex-metal band members who perform using bamboo instruments they've built themselves. They will be joined by recent Morphine signees, Tarawangsa, as well as Rabih Beaini, Otto Sidharta and Uwalmassa.

###Ata Ratu
Tuesday 5 December 2017

Ata Ratu's appearance at Europalia Festival and Raung Raya marks the first time she has ventured outside of Indonesia, and promises to be a very special performance. She will be showcasing her unique vocal techniques as well as playing a stringed instrument she crafted herself, known as Juke. Joining her will be Aural Archipelago, project of the American ethnomusicologist Palmer Keen, as well as the original band of Rully Shabara (who wrote the excellent Morphine released 'Huruf Hidup' 7"), Zoo.

###The Craft of Senyawa
Wednesday 10 January 2018

For followers of Morphine Records, Senyawa will need little introduction. The Yogyakarta-based duo, consisting of Wukir Suryadi and vocalist Rully Shabara, will present a selection of their compositions using instruments brought over from Yogyakarta. Supporting the performance will be the Belgian womens choir, Patshika Cie.

###Aloysius Suwardi's Planet Harmonik
Tuesday 16 January 2018

The Planet Harmonik Ensemble is comprised of 22 musicians, playing traditional Gamelan instruments. They will close the Raung Raya series with a performance led by Al Suwardi, one of the most notable figures in contemporary Indonesian Gamelan.
