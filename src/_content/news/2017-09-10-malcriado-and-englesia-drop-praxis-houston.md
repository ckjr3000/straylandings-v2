blockquote: "A new compilation in aid of Hurricane Harvey has been launched by DJ-producers Malcriado and Englesia. The name 'Malcriado' comes from the Spanish word for 'spoiled', but here it is us being spoiled with a litany of short, sharp musical curiosities. Among them, new material from Laurel Halo, a Chino Amobi sound collage and abstract rework of Nine Inch Nails' 'Closer' (_I wanna fuck you like an animal..._). Some may know Englesia from the nascent UNITI event series: a night championing women, non-binary and LGBTQ+ musicians. You can get a taste of the UNITI nights on Englesia's own contribution to the compilation, 'Don't FW Me'."

A new compilation in aid of Hurricane Harvey has been launched by DJ-producers Malcriado and Englesia. The name 'Malcriado' comes from the Spanish word for 'spoiled', but here it is us being spoiled with a litany of musical curiosities. Among them, new material from Laurel Halo, a Chino Amobi sound collage and an abstract rework of Nine Inch Nails' 'Closer' (_I wanna fuck you like an animal..._). Kareem Lofty's mournful 'Swamp' is particularly special. Some may know Englesia from the nascent UNITI event series: a night championing women, non-binary and LGBTQ+ musicians. You can get a taste of the UNITI nights on Englesia's own contribution to the compilation, 'Don't FW Me'.

All proceeds from PRAXIS HOUSTON go towards Greater Houston Autonomous Relief (GHAR), a grassroots coalition of groups from the Greater Houston community, offering direct support to those most impacted by Hurricane Harvey. GHAR are unique in that they work without the aid of the state or from private corporations, instead working horizontally in solidarity. Read more about the project, and listen to the compilation [here](https://praxishouston.bandcamp.com/album/praxis-houston).
