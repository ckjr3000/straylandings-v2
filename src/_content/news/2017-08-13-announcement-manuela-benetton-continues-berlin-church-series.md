Event curator Manuela Benetton recently announced the next three instalments of her series of gigs hosted in Berlin churches.

Previous events have showcased and encouraged novel collaborations. In May for example, Canadian glitch artist and internet terror Jesse Osborne-Lanthier displayed a one off collaborations with Haunter Records founder Daniele Guerrini, while supporting avante-noise trio Merzbow, Keiji Haino and Balázs Pándi. 

On September 16, Mitte's St. Elisabethkirche will host a new collaboration, this time from Pan Daijing, Valerio Tricoli and Werner Dafeldecker entitled 'The Speaker'. The collaboration is billed as a piece of 'aural theatre' using both dialogue and live electronics to explore themes of "solipsism, paranoia and identity". The event is well timed, Daijing having recently released her hair-raising debut-album, _Lack_, on Bill Kouligas' PAN imprint, aligning crushing electronics, disturbed cinematic timbres and crawling sound-design. 

There will also be a supporting performance from acousmatic composer, Beatriz Ferreyra. Her debut record was in the late-1970s, with a number of lengthy hiatus' in terms of recorded works. In recent years however she has put out a number of LPs, including the alien phase experiments of _GRM Works_, released through Editions Mego.
