Last year saw the birth of a new events collective in London: Edited Arts. The Edited team hosted three very different events over the year around South East London, including their debut in an abandoned Deptford police station, audio-visual performances and live-coding. Their ethos is one of audience participation and collaboration, through multidisciplinary performances and platforming of lesser-known artists. 

Next week, Edited Arts are hosting 'Futureshock' at London's New River Studios. The name 'futureshock' is borrowed from Alvin Toffler, who defined it as the psychological state of individuals and societies exposed to what he called â€˜too much change in too short a period of time'. The evening thus aims to explore these futurist ideas surrounding the psychology of acceleration and emergent technologies. They write, "at Futureshock we will consider how much is too much and explore the current boundaries between humans and technology. By creating an immersive multi-sensory experience we hope to question the effects of constant multiple digital stimuli in our daily lives." 

There will be performances from Shiva Feshareki, Shelley Parker and Typeface as well as many others.
