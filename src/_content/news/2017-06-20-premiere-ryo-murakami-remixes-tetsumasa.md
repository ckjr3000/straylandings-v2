Switching from cassette releases to vinyl is seen as a graduation point for many labels. Berlin-based Arboretum Records seem to have done things the other way round however. 

Following a string of 12"s from the likes of Honzo, Dr√∏p and label founder Marco Berardi aka Mogano, the label are set to release their debut tape on June 27. To date Arboretum have maintained a very distinct aesthetic, both sonically and visually, and this latest release from Tetsumasa Okumura is no different.  

Entitled the 'Obake' EP, the release is a fluid and subtle exploration into leftfield percussive music, from the faltering half-step of 'Mabolo' to the haunting dub reductions of 'Balot'. Tetsumasa and Berardi have also collaborated sonically on 'Ishiki', a vaporous and expansive contribution calling to mind the productions of an artist like T++.

The release closes with a claustrophobic remix of the opener, 'Steeroll', from fellow Japanese-producer Ryo Murakami, best known for his darkly meditative releases on UAE-label, Bedouin. His remix recasts the faded percussive musings and lurching bassweight of the original into an unsettling marriage of  subatomic ambience and cloying atmospherics.
