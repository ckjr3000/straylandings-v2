Chung will also be concluding her 3-month residency with a live music event, taking place in the crypt below Somerset House’s courtyard, presented in collaboration with [Lacking Sound Festival](https://www.facebook.com/LSF.Taiwan/) based in Taipei, Taiwan. 

Lacking Sound Festival is one of the most prestigious events for experimental sound artists in Taiwan. It was founded by a group of sound artists who saw the lack of platform and community for this creative medium, and started a monthly event for performances. It has been running continuously in Taiwan for the past 8 years. Lacking Sound Festival does not only introduce international new talents, but also dedicates themselves to documenting and producing theory writing on the Taiwanese sound art scene. In collaborating with Chung, this will be the very first time that Lacking Sound Festival presenting its associated artists in Europe.

The Taiwanese Experimental Music event will feature live performances from prominent Taiwanese artists Wang Fujui, Lu Yi, Meuko! Meuko!, TZU NI and LTY.
