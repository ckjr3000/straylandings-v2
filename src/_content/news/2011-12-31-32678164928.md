Attempting to chart the various differing approaches taken to bass music, Residual Rifts is the first of our compilation series. Comprised of eight original productions, Residual Rifts covers a wide range of genre’s that have been exploited in the UK since the first inception of electronic music in the early eighties. From dusty, funk tinged house, to the murky depths of nineties style garage and industrial techno, Residual Rifts includes contributions from Aubyn, Stavrogin, Etch, Anima, Ano, Alexander Domaille, Ka & Tarquin.
