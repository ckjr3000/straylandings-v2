Music Hackspace at Somerset House Studios have announced their schedule for the coming months this year. The project has long incorporated experimental approaches to music and technology, with ongoing workshops, meetups, artist talks and performances. Their approach frequently straddles instrument design (synth building, circuit customisation) and contemporary coding software (TidalCycles, Supercollider), with an emphasis on open-source technology. 

This summer, Music Hackspace will present a diverse range of events, including an exciting new project entitled _Scramble Everything_ with artist-in-residence, Ewa Justka. _Scramble Everything_ will host a daytime [workshop](http://musichackspace.org/events/scramble-everything-workshop-with-ewa-justka-evol/) on synth building with Justka and EVOL, followed by a party with music from Justka, EVOL, Shelley Parker, and Dale Cornish. Befaco and Casper Electronics will also be offering [courses](http://musichackspace.org/whatson?category=workshops) on synth building, and [Johann Diedrick](http://musichackspace.org/events/harvester-build-diy-sampler-johann-diedrick/) will be showing off a new DIY sampler.

There is also a series of workshops around music software, including a 3-part SuperCollider series from Joanne Armitage. They will also continue their monthly [TidalCycles meetups](http://musichackspace.org/whatson?from=2018-04-18&category=meet-ups&count=15&page=1&order=asc), with two-months specifically for women and non binary people only, hosted by Blue Maignien, Hazel Ryan and Lucy Cheesman.
